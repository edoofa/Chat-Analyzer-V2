8/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
8/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes they are clear
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes im following
8/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
8/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
8/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 686 4148: they are clear as well thank you
8/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes we can start
8/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc. <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

8/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
8/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i agree with all of this and i understood through the videos thank you
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
8/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes we are on the same page
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

9/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 686 4148: 2. Some common causes of gas pipeline vibration in 20 carbon steel lines include:

Mechanical resonance: When the natural frequency of the pipeline matches the frequency of the gas flow, it can lead to mechanical resonance and cause vibration.

Changes in Pressure: Sudden changes in pressure within the pipeline can lead to turbulence flow which may inturn increase the vibration intensity of the pipe. Turbulence tends to excite natural frequency of the piping system therefore increasing vibrations and this leads to a lot of mechanical stress and destroys the pipes.

Earthquakes can cause piping vibration either directly due to resonance or by the motion of equipment connections made to the pipe. Pipes in areas known to have eartquakes should be checked for forces.

Corrosion of pipes.Corrosion of the pipeline system can lead to surfaces being unbalanced therefore causing the pipeline to vibrate and in worst vase scenarios the pipes may end up breaking apart. This therefore causes a vibration in the pipes

There is also changes in temperature which in turn lead to the gas in the pipe undergoing compressions and contractions. These changes cause a lot of stress and strain to the pipe therefore leading to vibrational responses
9/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 686 4148: 3.When using a pumping loop to mix two miscible fluids in a tank, when can the
contents be considered well mixed?

The contents can be considered well mixed through inspection whereby the color of the contents is consistant and there are no visible layers in the liquid.
Also they can be considered mixed when the contents are uniformly distributed that is the contents have entirely mingles throughout the whole tank such that they have acquired a state of homogeneity.
When there is turbulence, the pumping loop generates turbulence flow in the tank so that the the liquids can easily mix. Also the turbulence flow helps break up small packets of unmixed fluid until to a condition where the liquids are efficiently mixed.
For good mixing of these fluids more time is required due to that the liquids have different fluid properties and due to some factors such as tank volume. Therefore if more time is taken efficient mixing is guranteed.
9/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 686 4148: 4. Are there any general rules for flushing slurry lines?


Flushing slurry lines is an important process to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the system. While the specific procedures for flushing slurry lines can vary based on the characteristics of the slurry and the design of the system, there are some general rules and best practices that can be followed:

Use of a compatible flushing fluid. A compatible flushing fluid should be selected which is compatible with the slurry and the materials of construction in the system. The flushing fluid should be able to effectively displace and remove the slurry without causing damage to the equipment or creating any reactions.
 Also the flushing of slurry lines flow raate should be considered. The flow rate of the flushing fluid should be carefully controlled to ensure effective removal of the slurry. A flow rate that is very high may cause turbulence, while a low flow rate may not effectively displace the slurry. It is key to follow safety in flushing slurry lines such that the flushed slurry should be properly handled with care and carefully decomposed of. Also the wearingbof safety equipment is vital to protect from any toxins which may emulate from these slurry lines. The flushing process should be documented. The type of flushing fluid used, flow rates, duration of flushing, and any observations are taken note of during this process.
If possible sequential flushing should be performed whereby different types of flushing fluids are used in the slurry pipelines to ensure thorough removal of the slurry. For example, a water flush followed by a solvent flush may be effective for certain types of slurries.
9/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 686 4148: 5. What is pneumatic conveying?

Pneumatic conveying is a method of transporting materials using air as conveying medium. Pneumatic conveying involves the transport of materials by air or other gases. It is the movement of bulky material such as powders through a pipeline using a gas normally air as the transporting medium.
There are two types of pneumatic conveying systems and these include:

Dilute phase pneumatic conveying
In dilute phase pneumatic conveying the material is suspended in the air stream and moves through the pipeline at high velocities at a relatively low pressure.

Characteristics of dilute phase pneumatic conveying
High Conveying Velocity. The material is transported at high velocities ensuring that the particles remain suspended in the air stream.

Suitable for Free Flowing Materials. It is well suited for conveying materials that are free flowing and do not tend to pack

Low Pressure Differential.Dilute phase conveying typically operates at lower pressure differentials compared to dense phase conveying, making it suitable for conveying materials over longer distances with lower energy requirements.

Dense phase pneumatic conveying

Dense phase pneumatic conveying the bulk materials, such as powders or granules are transported through a pipeline using air or gas as another medium at a slower velocity and higher pressure. This  results in a higher concentration of the material within the air stream.

Characteristics of dense phase pneumatic conveying

Low Conveying Velocity. The material is transported at lower velocities compared to dilute phase conveying. This slower movement helps to minimize particle degradation.

High Pressure Differential. Dense phase conveying operates at higher pressure differentials allowing for the transport of materials over longer distances and through more complex pipeline configurations.

Advantages and Disadvantages of pneumatic conveying

Advantages
Increased safety.
With fewer moving parts and less required maintenance, pneumatic conveying systems present less danger. 

Lower required maintenance.
Compared to mechanical conveying systems pneumatic conveyors have less moving parts and typically require less maintenance.

Less spillage and dust leakage.
Pneumatic conveying systems transport product through an enclosed pipeline therefore preventing any leakages.

Good Sanitation
Since pneumatic conveying systems have an enclosed pipeline the risk of product contamination is greatly reduced and the plant remains cleaner as well

Disadvantages
Some materials are difficult to transmit.
Pneumatic conveying systems are great for lower density bulk material powders such as flour and sugar but not for materials with larger particle sizes. For example materials with high fat are more difficult to convey by air and can cause buildup in the pipeline. 

Low energy efficiency. As these systems use air to push products through the conveyor, this means that they need more power to achieve maximum results.
9/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 71 686 4148: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
9/1/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Chemical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
9/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 686 4148: thank you too
9/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes the information is accurate <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 686 4148: all the information is clear thank you
9/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear, Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
9/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes my counselor discussed this with me
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
9/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 686 4148: we are on the same page
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
9/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes ive taken note of this fee breakup
9/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
9/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $1000= $2600 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $1300 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1300 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
9/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 686 4148: oky the information is clear
9/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 411 4927: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 686 4148: thank you for the information
9/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 686 4148: no queries
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
9/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
9/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i have reviewed these benefits
9/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 686 4148: oky i understand the value and need of this seat
9/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes it resonates with me
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 686 4148: it resonates with me
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 686 4148: im following thoroughly so far
9/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 686 4148: may you please provide me with information
9/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 686 4148: okay this is quite an opportunity
9/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i think they won't get anywhere
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i agree with this
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i am clear with this solution
9/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes its clear
9/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
9/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
9/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 71 686 4148: okay this is clear
9/1/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 71 686 4148: no queries
9/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes im really excited
9/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

12/1/24, 11:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear!

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/1/24, 9:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/1/24, 9:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

16/1/24, 9:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 7:59 AM - +263 71 686 4148: good morning to everyone i would like to say that im delighted in gaining a scholarship and thank the program for helping me out in every way they could
17/1/24, 7:59 AM - +263 71 686 4148: 12:00pm is okay for a discussion
17/1/24, 8:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 12:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU University admission formalities.
17/1/24, 8:02 AM - +263 71 686 4148: okay, thank you very much
17/1/24, 8:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263716864148
17/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Babongile ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 71 686 4148: good afternoon to everyone
17/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes i would like if we went deeper through all the details
17/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Good afternoon team
17/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Thank you let's discuss the details of payments. Do you have Zimbabwean associate where we can deposit the fees on behalf of the university??
17/1/24, 12:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 12:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Noted thank you
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 411 4927: Lets proceed with the discussions
17/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 411 4927: 1. $1225
2.4years (8 semesters)
3. 200USD
4.700USD
17/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 77 735 7940: It's noted thank you
17/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
17/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 735 7940: We will settle for on campus accommodation
17/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777357940. If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Alas then we have to settle for off campus accommodation which is affordable in the circumstances. It's good to know that you will help the student connect with other Endoofians outside the campus. Things are tight in Zimbabwe and as such we will take anything affordable to us.
17/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777357940. We will indeed help you in opting the comfortable option for accommodation. You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 411 4927: This is clear
17/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
17/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 411 4927: May you explain how the payment plan works
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *January 30th, 2024*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Sure we are in agreement regarding the details in the offer letter, but you still have not advised on the payment modalities when in l asked if you do have associate Zimbabwean personnel whom we can pay through the university fees
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 411 4927: No, reside in Zimbabwe Bulawayo
17/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Noted thank you. I will make arrangements with Mr Rajan, otherwise paying through telegraphic transfer directly to an lndian bank account is so expensive.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 735 7940: Since am in Bulawayo a town 440 kilometres from Harare, l am sure l  can serve traveling costs by dealing with Charles Jerera. I do have his banking details. Thank you
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263777357940. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes this is clear
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 686 4148: no queries
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
