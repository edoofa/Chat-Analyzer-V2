20/12/23, 1:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
26/12/23, 6:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwanashe ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 6:13 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Afternoon ma'am, I'm ready
26/12/23, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263788175746, Let me share the remaining benefits of Endowment benefit with you.
26/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Sure please
26/12/23, 6:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Provide more information please
26/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 6:22 PM - +263 78 817 5746: I was following and it was very clear
26/12/23, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 78 817 5746: They will be able to pursue
26/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes
26/12/23, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes all clear
26/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes
26/12/23, 6:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 6:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Understood ma'am, all was clear
26/12/23, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 78 817 5746: No queries for now
26/12/23, 6:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes let's move on
26/12/23, 7:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

26/12/23, 7:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Ashi. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 11:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Afternoon ma'am
17/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788175746 Have you gone through the above messages ?
17/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Thank you and I'm very excited to have received the offer letter
17/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes please help
17/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Okay noted maan
17/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes it does work for me thank you
17/1/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 817 5746: 1.$975
2.3 years
3.$200
4.$700
17/1/24, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
17/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes that's correct
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 265 5964: Good afternoon.The offer letter is out ,what if i dont have the funds like its needed by the end of Januaryc ,is itt possible to use the same letter next semester
17/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772655964 I appreciate that you have shared this query with us, I will be assisting you with your query at the end of the discussion so that we can share all the important information with you. I hope that's fine ?
17/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 78 817 5746: I have some questions regarding the program l want to take
17/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, May I know what are your questions ?
17/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 817 5746: I want to become a geotechnical engineer and l was told that l have to do B.A.in Geography but according to my research it's different
17/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 265 5964: The other question is if he completed the course is there any chances of employment there if he wishes
17/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I have been occupied with an urgent meeting, However let's connect tomorrow at 12:00 pm so that I can assist your queries
17/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwanashe, How are you doing?
18/1/24, 12:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion ?
18/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Afternoon ma'am yes I'm available
18/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788175746 May I know why you want to become Geotechnical Engineer ?
18/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 817 5746: I want to become to become a geotechnical engineer so that l can play an important role in the construction and maintenance of buildings, bridges, tunnels, and other structures. I want to work to ensure the safety and stability of the earth's surface. This field offers a unique opportunity to combine scientific knowledge with practical engineering applications.
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, I am glad to know your perspective here. I would like to address this concern as well. However as we are in middle of our discussion. I would like to first complete our letter discussion. Is it okay ?
18/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 78 817 5746: It's okay
18/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
18/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
18/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes l am clear
18/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes I'm following all clear
18/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 265 5964: Good afternoon. I think let's first confirm if the program he wants is available????
18/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263772655964, I had a conversation with your counselor, she mentioned that you were initially interested in Geo-Technical engineering although later on you were interested in *BA Geography*, right ?
18/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 817 5746: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The program is indeed connected Ms, Tushti has suggest you BA Geography according to your interest and the demand in the market.

18/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Okay thank ma'am
18/1/24, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
18/1/24, 10:48 PM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes ma'am but  the letter says the fee must be payed within 30 days of assuance of this letter or before 30 January.Can you help me understand this?
19/1/24, 8:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwanashe, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to your query, May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion ?
19/1/24, 8:26 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Good morning ma'am,l am available
19/1/24, 8:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are available. In order to help you understand the deadline for the registration procedure. I am sure you remember that there is a payment plan for the same.
19/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Okay thank you ma'am so I'm also able to pay half the fee within 15 days
19/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes it is clear
19/1/24, 8:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263788175746. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/1/24, 8:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes , Harare
19/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/1/24, 8:45 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Thank you my parents will contact him after making their arrangements
19/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/1/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 817 5746: So in total how much will l be paying using a 7% transfer rate for the first installment
19/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Yes please
19/1/24, 8:49 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let me share that with the 7% transfer rate, The charges amount will be $21 when you will make s transaction of $300
19/1/24, 8:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
19/1/24, 8:51 AM - +263 78 817 5746: Okay thank you, duly noted
19/1/24, 8:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/1/24, 8:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/1/24, 8:54 AM - +263 78 817 5746: I am very clear thank you
