I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i am done
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i am
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: I understand
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Am i going to pay this registration fee while in Zimbabwe or when i am in India?
18/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 You will be paying the registration fees when you are Zimbabwe as the university will be reserving your seat for scholarship although this will be needed when you will receive your offer letter
18/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand that the registration fees will be needed at the time of your registration at the university. However, for Edoofian students, this will not be an additional cost, as the registration fees will be adjusted in your tuition fees upon your arrival in India. I hope this clarifies your doubt ?
18/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am now i get it
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry ma'am i am lost a bit like the registration will be covered by the scholarship and then when i arrive i should cover it ,is that so
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, The scholarship covers your total cost of education which also includes your Registration fees, although you know the student who have applied for the admission at the university with Edoofa Scholarship they have to pay the registration fees and the complete tuition fees which means for them the registration fees is an additional cost. Please don't worry as we will have a detailed discussion about the same in our upcoming session
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am so we can proceed
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

19/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 697 8729: As for the last one i did not understand
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes now i get it but can i know how this SOP works
19/1/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries please, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes please
19/1/24, 11:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
