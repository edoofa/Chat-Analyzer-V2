6/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emily!

 So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
6/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Thank you Ms Ananya
10/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
11/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Ok that is great
11/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!
11/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Ok thank you
12/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Hello Ms Ananya
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Wow that's so awesome
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Noted
12/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Nice meeting them
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Yah very interesting
12/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 794 4385: See you it was a great session indeed
15/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily!

How are you doing today? I'm excited to share that we have beautifully decorated the walls of our office gallery! The space now reflects creativity and inspiration. I am so excited to add our photo here as well!🚀🤝🏽
15/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to hear from your end. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
16/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I was facing data challenges as my schools wifi was turned off
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Emily!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
18/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emily

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 304 7944: How are you feeling today
18/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am feeling better, Emily! <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Emily, I have noticed that you've been a bit irregular lately. May I ask if everything is alright?
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 304 7944: I am at school so at times I will be in class
18/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I understand and appreciate that you are working to finance your education, it is crucial for you to finish your EWYL orientation with me, as mentioned earlier. If you are not able to do that, you can ask your parents to attend the session with me and understand the basics of the program.

This will ensure a smooth process, and we can later connect on the projects only. Please let me know if you proceed in this manner.
18/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Okay ma'am
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if your parents are going to join in? <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 304 7944: Yes they will join in tomorrow
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,  Emily!
