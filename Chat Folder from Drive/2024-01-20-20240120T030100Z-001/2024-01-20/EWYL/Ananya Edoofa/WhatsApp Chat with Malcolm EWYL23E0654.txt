7/1/24, 8:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Wow this seems really great
7/1/24, 8:46 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - +27 68 790 9284: Alright apologize
19/1/24, 9:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malcolm!

19/1/24, 3:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Malcolm, it would be tough for me to schedule a call earlier than 9:30 am.
19/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 68 790 9284: Ooh🤔alright l understand l will try to keep up with the time
