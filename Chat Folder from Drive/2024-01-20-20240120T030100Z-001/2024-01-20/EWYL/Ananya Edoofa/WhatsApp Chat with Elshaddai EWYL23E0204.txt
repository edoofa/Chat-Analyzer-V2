I hope you all had a wonderful holiday break. Before we dive into today's lesson, I'd love to hear about how your Christmas was. Did you do anything special or have any interesting experiences you'd like to share?
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀

3/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 9:32 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting to hear from your end. I had an amazing session planned for you! Why didn't you attend your session? Are you facing any challenges?
5/1/24, 7:27 AM - +263 78 956 1557: M currently facing data challenges and things are kinda tight for me...am so sorry

5/1/24, 8:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai!

 Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼
5/1/24, 8:36 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Sure
5/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Elshaddai, I can see that you have been facing some data challenges lately. However, could you please tell me how we are going to proceed with our sessions? Is it going to be like this?
5/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Not anymore am back
5/1/24, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Are you promising this?
5/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Mmmm 
.. okay l will be more available.promise
5/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
5/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
5/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
5/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Ohh okay noted
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly drop a message now, and from the next time, we will connect at our scheduled time. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Its okay
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Elshaddai!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 78 956 1557: Ohhh that sounds great
10/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 248 3564: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 11:25 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai!

Thank you for sharing this with me, however, can I know if you have shared this with your admissions team?
11/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Yes l have
12/1/24, 8:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
15/1/24, 8:46 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263789561557 @263772483564 

I have been waiting to hear from you for more than a few weeks now, and I am very disappointed to see that you are not showing sincerity towards our EWYL program. You know we specifically allocate slots and time for you, and your non-attendance is truly disappointing and demotivating.

I hope you remember that you have signed a document to ensure your availability for completing the orientation. Although the scheduled time for your orientation has already passed, I have taken it upon myself to extend and complete your orientation. However, it seems like you do not value this opportunity. Can I know the reason behind this? Do you wish to discuss something with me?
15/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 248 3564: Hallo thank you for the mail ..I haven't been around for work and ELSHADDAI has been home not too well Also the network issues in his place power issues were on the rise.Our sincerest apologies lovely. We need to emphasize the fact that the program is a golden opportunity snd we have submitted our A level result slip just yesterday .Thank you so much for all the help and kindness the knowledge u imparting is greatly appreciated.
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772483564

16/1/24, 8:46 AM - +263 77 248 3564: I am sure later today can do or tomorrow morning.

19/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
