The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
]
16/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 372 3003: No please elaborate
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Noted and thankyou
16/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us conclude our session here, and remember, every effort you put in is a step closer to success. Keep participating, stay motivated, and earn those credits! You're all doing great, and I look forward to our continued journey together. See you next time!ac
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted and thankyou!
17/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Afternoon everyone!
18/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Good Afternoon, everyone!
18/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Prosper!

18/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
18/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
18/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Edoofa hall of inspiration
18/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes it is
18/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Prosper?
18/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 3003: It sounds great
18/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 372 3003: They are also great goals
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes
18/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 372 3003: I'm done
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay from what l read l understood that as Edoofans we have 3 projects to do as part of our EWYL program. The first one is to identify companies or organisations for example the one's that bases on education and gather information about the company that is it's number of workers using  and recruit them in having a contract with Edoofa so as to help other students with potentials in having good education as well as helping students acquire business skills needed in future.

The second activity is to recruit other youths of my age who have graduated in their secondary education either recently or have 6months. The aim is to tell them about the vision of Edoofa and help them get the opportunity of achieving their dreams of gaining or acquiring higher education with the help of Edoofa. Lastly we have to make a list of schools surrounding us in our places and approach them so as to tell them about Edoofa. By doing so will be having the aim of making them have a partnership with Edoofa so as to help other students with greater potentials.
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Okay noted
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great job!
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!

19/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes ma'am
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 372 3003: We what we call the cooperate alliance which helps us understand our fields of work as we have connect with companies that are technologically driven using an app known as LinkedIn which  shows different types of companies and their profiles. After identification of such companies we have to interact with the decision makers and set a meeting with them so that can connect with team Edoofa for more information. The company must also have  25-30 members according to the requirements.
19/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks. I’m happy with your understanding.
19/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds.

19/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
19/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 372 3003: When searching for such companies we have to consider factors such as nature of the company that is is it student centric or recreation. We also have to consider scale of the company that is it's number of people ranging from (50-200) and above or its financial status. We also consider the founders background that is his achievements and also the mission of the company
19/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
