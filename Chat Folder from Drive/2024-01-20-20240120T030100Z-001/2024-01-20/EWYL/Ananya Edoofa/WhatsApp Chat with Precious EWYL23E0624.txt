The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.

Precious won't be able to connect as he is not feeling well. We have been hospitalised since yesterday.  But he is getting better today and we pray that he continue to get better
