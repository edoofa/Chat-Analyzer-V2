16/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*.

Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Yea I do understand
16/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share those with me!

18/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 255 1097: It's OK l understand and I'm sorry for late reply my phone was dead <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Chirembwe
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

19/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Good afternoon let me check
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, let us discuss the goals and objectives of the EWYL program! So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you for sharing
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Okay noted
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 255 1097: OK noted
19/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 255 1097: I am done
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
19/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 255 1097: I think all 7 parts I like them
19/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you for sharing it is inspiring
19/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 255 1097: It sounds great
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, share your understanding of this document with me before our next session. 

Let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! 🚀
19/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Yes it is clear
19/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 255 1097: Thank you
