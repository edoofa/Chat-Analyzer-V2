What's been challenging for you?
26/12/23, 12:00 PM - +263 77 861 2601: trying to make books and the project balance since they are equally important for me
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Mishael!

Facing challenges and doing many things at once is like a magic trick for success. Trying new things is where the fun happens, and doing a few things together is how you go higher. You know, like when people work a bit to pay for school? It's a bit like that. If you want good things to happen, just start with a little effort. Believe me, it's a cool way to get big things coming your way!
