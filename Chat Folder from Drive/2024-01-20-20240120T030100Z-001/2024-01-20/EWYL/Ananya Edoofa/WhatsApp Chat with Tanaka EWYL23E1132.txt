18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Wow It's so inspiring
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?

18/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm Tanaka Sharmaine Sabawu. I'm a girl aged 19. I wrote my A level exams last year November and my wish is to become a lawyer. My favorite hobby is valley ball.
18/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! 😊 It's awesome that you're aiming to become a lawyer. Best of luck with your A-level exams from last November! 📚 Volleyball is such a fun hobby. Do you play for a team or just casually with friends?
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I used to play in a school team
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Oh, that's amazing!
18/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Tanaka, I wish we could have connected for a longer time today. However, since our session is for one hour only, we can now connect tomorrow at the same time.

19/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanaka!
Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :

19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Afternoon how are you
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm trying to open it
19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright. You can watch it later.
19/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Noo can you kindly explain them to me
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Wow that's incredible
19/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok it's nice to have them
19/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Yes so interesting
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
19/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok
19/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 441 3438: I'm done
19/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
19/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 441 3438: It's hard to tell honestly mostly the last two sections
19/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
19/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Sounds great
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, share your understanding of this document with me before our next session. 

Let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! 🚀 <This message was edited>
19/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 441 3438: Ok I'll share my understanding before the next session
