I understand your concern. Well, you know, this could signify that they are not interested in studying here in India. Now, for this, there can be two approaches:

You, being a live testimony of the program, can actually highlight the pros of you being here in India through Edoofa. Not only the quality education but also the numerous opportunities!

Meanwhile, you should start searching for students who are genuinely interested in pursuing their higher education in India.
