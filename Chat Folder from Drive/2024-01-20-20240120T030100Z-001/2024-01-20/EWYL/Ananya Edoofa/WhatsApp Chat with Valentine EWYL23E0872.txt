2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
2/1/24, 1:59 PM - +27 71 622 8502: My name is Valentine Madzvara. I live in a small village where I show interest in education , my favorite topics lies in numbers and biology. I use my spare time with my father ,feeding animals. I also play soccer and chess with my friends.
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Valentine! It's great to meet you. Your interest in education, particularly in numbers and biology, is fantastic! Exploring diverse subjects like that can open up so many possibilities. Spending spare time with your father and feeding animals sounds like a wonderful bonding activity. Soccer and chess with friends add a nice mix of physical and mental stimulation. Keep enjoying those activities and nurturing your passions! If you ever want to chat about numbers, biology, soccer, or anything else, feel free to reach out. Cheers! 👋⚽🔢🔬
2/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you.
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I. Mago is my mother and she might not be online currently but I'm sure she will respond as soon as she gets online.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I would like to know more about the two objectives please
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you 
I do understand
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I am delighted to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi , thank you for you passion into helping us (Edoofians). I hope we have fruitful sessions. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Sounds very interesting
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand however since our session time is over, let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - +27 71 622 8502: 😂very funny 
Thank you so much , we will meet tomorrow
3/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Mentor
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon! How are you doing?

3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!🌟
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I loved being inspired by Nyasha Grace's work , she is incredible and had me wondering what more can I do. The quote " we do not need to be smarter than that the rest , we need to be more disciplined" was my most favourite because it works together with my morals. But all in all , everything was a hit , I loved the words that did not hit around the bush. And I'm looking forward for another one .
3/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
3/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 71 622 8502: This sound great Mentor

I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 9:13 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I wish you the best 🤩 , may it be of great beneficial to you all. I will be waiting for those awesome pictures and till then have great time.
6/1/24, 9:13 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I apologise for viewing this amazing news  lately. Enjoy you experience !
11/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 2:59 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I thank you for the reminder ,i promise to do my best. Have a good day ahead
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:39 PM - +27 71 622 8502: wow that is an incredible fact , thank you
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

12/1/24, 2:09 PM - +27 71 622 8502: This is interesting
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

After this I am supposed to share the principal's contacts and details with you" my Mentor".

Q3. Limpopo
16/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. Therefore,  I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Yes Mentor 
Which means I should start right away to communicate with my school right?
16/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, you can!May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head ?
16/1/24, 2:16 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Not as for now but I can get them easily
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - +27 71 622 8502: The school might not be connected to Edoofa but one of the representatives once apoke to our principal last year and some students were interested.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, wee’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on! <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I will do that Mentor
Have a good day ahead
16/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Also,since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
16/1/24, 2:32 PM - +27 71 622 8502: That is well noted Mentor 😃
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: "I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
16/1/24, 2:35 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Well noted
16/1/24, 2:36 PM - +27 71 622 8502: So tomorrow we will have the Wednesday lesson ?
16/1/24, 2:37 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Do I only say " I am a Proud Edoofian" during my batch timing?
17/1/24, 1:23 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Mentor 
I regret to inform you that there is load shedding in my area during our time slot , which means my connection might be very weak then. But I will try to connect.
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 1:36 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I am very sorry for that Mentor. You will get well very soon 😃
18/1/24, 1:38 PM - +27 71 622 8502: How are you today ?
18/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am much better, Valentine! Thank you so much.
18/1/24, 1:45 PM - +27 71 622 8502: That is great to hear 🥳
18/1/24, 1:56 PM - +27 71 622 8502: +27 82 593 9748 Ms Nell 
Dynamique high school Head
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
18/1/24, 2:05 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I promise to pay attention
18/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

18/1/24, 2:17 PM - +27 71 622 8502: So I should construct my message just like this and send to her immediately ?
18/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes
18/1/24, 2:31 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I send it
I would like to inform you that tomorrow the last year results will be released
18/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Have fun valentine!🤝🏽
