I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Its okay ma'am and thank you again have a nice weekend too
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ashley!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am its fine wish you the best
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Morning ma'am how are you, iam fine with the schedule its alright
11/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay that's impressive to hear ma'am
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 656 7965: I'm glad you did had a great time

11/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Yes a little bit ma'am but not really
11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am its all clear now
11/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 656 7965: Thank you ma'am, that would be nice to be intact with them
11/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow!

I hope you're all ready for a great session. Let's kick things off with a quick joke to lighten the mood:

Why did the math book look sad? Well, because it had too many problems! 😄
16/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 656 7965: 😃im okay ma'am and ready for the session
16/1/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

16/1/24, 8:47 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Yes ma'am, Completely interesting
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
16/1/24, 8:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay let me go through it

16/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 656 7965: This was nice to hear ma'am
16/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 656 7965: I liked the whole section especially when Mr Anhad said the way to align yourself with your environment is to design your environment to work for you instead of against you,which a big lesson
16/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
16/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 71 656 7965: This sound perfectly amazing, and  wonderful ma'am
16/1/24, 9:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time! See you!🚀

17/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Good morning Ms Ananya
18/1/24, 8:31 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, due to bad health, I had to take a day off.
18/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay I understand you ma'am, how are you feeling now

18/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
18/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Noted and clear
18/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Iam through ma'am
18/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 71 656 7965: I've surely understood some of the information ma'am, I will ask you if I have any problem regarding these projects
18/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I'd like you to share your understanding of the document before our next session. See you!
19/1/24, 8:12 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Okay ma'am, I've understood that this EWYL document consists of 2 projects. The first project  named corporate alliances aligns the roles that I as an Edoofian should play. It emphasizes on identifying nearby or local companies whereby edoofians should share edoofa's vision , its mission and its main functions to the  decision makers. In this project ,we edoofians are supposed to contact these individual decision makers through the LinkedIn ,and convince them to go through Skype with team Edoofa to get full information about this program. After the video call is done,a contract is signed
19/1/24, 8:13 AM - +263 71 656 7965: The second project is for community building. This projects emphasizes on us edoofians to spread information about Edoofa program to  students who have graduated  from senior  secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months. This project aligns with us edoofians to go in secondary schools and persuade students to get into this program such that they could understand the most critical aspect of developing an organization which is based on growing through creating social impact. Firstly, application forms are filled. This simply mean that an extensive list of all the students or youth who i have enrolled is filled. Secondly, i as an Edoofian then shares edoofa visions and missions to those youths who have recently graduated from senior secondary school or in the last six months throughEdoofa's help.
19/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 71 656 7965: Morning ma'am
19/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Ashley!
