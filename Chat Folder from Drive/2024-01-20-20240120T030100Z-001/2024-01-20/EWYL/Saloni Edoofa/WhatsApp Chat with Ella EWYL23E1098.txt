5/1/24, 1:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that, way too good, and I am so impressed by this🫶🏻
5/1/24, 1:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: May you please tell me the objectives
5/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Thank you Ms saloni
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 1:55 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Well understood
5/1/24, 2:01 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:06 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Im done Ms saloni
5/1/24, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what did you grasp from it?
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: What i got from the screenshot is that this student is now financial independent and this is all thanks to you,Ms saloni and the team.Therefore your guidance and mentorship has been a great help to his life and career.
5/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: And also because of this program he has managed to pay his tuition fees
5/1/24, 2:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I am sure Ella that we will achieve milestones even higher🫶🏻
5/1/24, 2:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.

May we begin with our session?
16/1/24, 1:36 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Hello Ms saloni
We are all good,thanks

16/1/24, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank yoU!
16/1/24, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 1:41 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am glad
16/1/24, 1:49 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am done Ms salonii
16/1/24, 1:57 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: Hello Saloni
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Well your right Ms saloni each section has it's taste and interest but the part i liked the most is where its written that we should focus on finding solutions instead of dwelling on problems. Besides from that the three qoutes written are also inspiring and gives one the zeal to work hard.
16/1/24, 3:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

18/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have got it well🌟
18/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
