12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 686 4148: thank you for the compliments i hope i will be that rewarding experience as well
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.

Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
15/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 686 4148: greetings 
the weekend was well and yours
15/1/24, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our sessions?
15/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 686 4148: yes we may begin
15/1/24, 1:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 686 4148: i donot understand the objectives
15/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/1/24, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 686 4148: thank you it is now all clear
15/1/24, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
