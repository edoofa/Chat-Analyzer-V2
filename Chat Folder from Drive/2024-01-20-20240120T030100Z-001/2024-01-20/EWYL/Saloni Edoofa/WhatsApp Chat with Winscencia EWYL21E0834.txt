Hope you are well.

After looking at the responses from everyone regarding the SLICE Con'24, I failed to find your feedback on the entire event. The SLICE Con'24 was an integral part of the journey that can lay the carpet for so many upcoming opportunities and hence, we would require your feedback. I am sure you will be able to fill out the form I am sharing below that can help EDOOFA's student journey to glorify🌟
