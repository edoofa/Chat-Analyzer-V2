18/1/24, 1:39 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Thank you for your interest and commitment
18/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Thank you for your interest

18/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 622 0692: My ambition is to become a highly profiled chartered accountant through this program hands on experience will help me achieve this goal
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, I am with you on this!
18/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Thank you for supporting me
18/1/24, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Employability through practical learning
18/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Making Education affordable and Employment ready
19/1/24, 1:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Friday everyone, 
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 622 0692: We are doing good.Yes we may start
19/1/24, 1:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That is indeed correct!
19/1/24, 1:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/1/24, 1:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Thank you
19/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Ok.Understood

19/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 622 0692: Read it.I hope to do the same and l will be committed as well
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *01:30-02:30 PM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
19/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 71 433 2297: Noted .Have a pleasant weekend
