You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

Hope you are well.

After looking at the responses from everyone regarding the SLICE Con'24, I failed to find your feedback on the entire event. The SLICE Con'24 was an integral part of the journey that can lay the carpet for so many upcoming opportunities and hence, we would require your feedback. I am sure you will be able to fill out the form I am sharing below that can help EDOOFA's student journey to glorify🌟
