May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *10:00 - 11:00 AM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
