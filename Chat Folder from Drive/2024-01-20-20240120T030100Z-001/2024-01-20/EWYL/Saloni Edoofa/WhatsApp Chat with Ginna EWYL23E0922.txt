I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
11/1/24, 9:47 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Friday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days. <This message was edited>

I would love ,l woudnt say *like* but l would *_love_* to be successful by finishing my degree and get a job ...and the EWYL Program will help in a great way by teaching me to be independent
16/1/24, 2:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Well, this is very straightforward and crisp, absolutely loved it🌟

16/1/24, 2:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well.

Hope you are well.

I am writing this message to inform you that I am not feeling well and, as a result, won't be able to take your session today. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. But don't worry, I will be available tomorrow and we will resume the sessions with even more energy🌟💪🏼
17/1/24, 1:33 PM - +27 84 757 2040: Get well soon maam

18/1/24, 1:45 PM - +27 84 757 2040: Yes we can begin
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/1/24, 1:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/1/24, 2:02 PM - +27 84 757 2040: Oky ...l am following
18/1/24, 2:14 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - +27 84 757 2040: Yeah l read it ....yeah you really help students
19/1/24, 1:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Friday everyone, 
How are you doing?

May we begin with our session?
19/1/24, 3:10 PM - +27 84 757 2040: Hello maam hw you
19/1/24, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *01:30-02:30 PM*. Unfortunately, due to some family commitments on Monday, I'll be occupied, and our session may not occur. However, I want you to go through everything that we have discussed so far in this time.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
