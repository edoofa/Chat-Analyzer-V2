27/12/23, 2:28 PM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
27/12/23, 2:30 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
27/12/23, 2:30 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now, Precious?

27/12/23, 2:32 PM - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare.

27/12/23, 2:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great Precious.
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
27/12/23, 2:58 PM - +91 96671 45908: Yes my school is already connected to Edoofa CHIBUWE High
27/12/23, 2:59 PM - +91 96671 45908: It is in Manicaland
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Precious.
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
27/12/23, 3:03 PM - +91 96671 45908: Yes l agree
27/12/23, 3:11 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
27/12/23, 3:11 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
27/12/23, 3:16 PM - +91 96671 45908: Yes l will connect with Mr Maposa but l am sure he really no about Edoofa
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Sharda Edoofa: In such a case you can try connecting with other nearby schools.
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
27/12/23, 3:19 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Precious, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*

School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

27/12/23, 3:43 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
27/12/23, 3:44 PM - +91 96671 45908: Okay oka
27/12/23, 4:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
27/12/23, 4:02 PM - +91 96671 45908: Okay okay l will do that
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great Precious.
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Sharda Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.
Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Precious, that concludes our initial orientation.
