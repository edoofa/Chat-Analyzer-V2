16/1/24, 8:21 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller*

Good morning, Silibele! Helen Keller nailed it – teamwork is our superpower! 💥 Let's pool our skills and ideas to crush it today! 🚀 Excited for our session together! 🤝💪
16/1/24, 8:22 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Yes l am looking forward to it let's get tuned
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Silibele. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great! So have you gone through the newsletter?
16/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Yes l did
16/1/24, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
16/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 898 6737: Every day, we are faced with hundreds, if not thousands, of choices. The vast majority of
them are insignificant, unimportant, or both. Is it really necessary to have an entire aisle
dedicated to toothpaste?
Most of us employ a satisficing approach in response to all of these decisions, a term
coined by Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon to describe something that isn't perfect but
good enough. This is a smart technique for things that don't matter. You have no idea
which pizza joint is the greatest, but you do know which ones are adequate. Satisficing is
one of the pillars of productive human conduct; it prevails when we don't waste time on
insignificant decisions, or, more precisely, when we don't waste time trying to improve
things that won't make a major difference in our enjoyment or satisfacaction.

To conclude that l can say l am inspire to choose important things  in life and be happy with what l already have and invest it in such way that  l can create my own name with just little effort l put on my work.
16/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 898 6737: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 898 6737: And also the Qoutes that Founder of the Edoofa scholarship program gave to the Edoofians inspired me a  for example one the quotes says (  Don’t limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do.
You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can
achieve.”– Mary Kay Ash, Founder Mary Kay Cosmetics
)....In this l have learned that you're allowed to scream ,shout and bang the doors but one thing l.know is that you're not allowed to Give up and there is of course morning wrong with having dreams and goals to pursue,however most of us don't stop to consider whether our self critical and competitive attitude is helping us to achieve these goals or it might my standing in our way and always know the difference between perfect and what's perfect for you because in this world no one is  perfect .(My biggest motivation? Just to keep challenging myself. I see life almost like one
long University education that I never had -- every day I’m learning something
new." - Richard Branson),it shows that Future is always brighter when you look beyond your status and success is inevitable when your determination is unquestionable.
16/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, I totally agree with you. I would like to appreciate you for how beautifully, descriptively you have shared your understanding.

19/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

19/1/24, 2:52 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 898 6737: Yes l do
19/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
19/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 898 6737: Um l allowed to do online meetings with schools that l have teachers that l know ,like talk with them through WhatsApp beacuse l will be far away from those schools?

19/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, of course Silibele. You can definitely do that.
19/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 898 6737: And the school where l did my Secondary level um far away from it
19/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
19/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 898 6737: Thank you

19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
19/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
19/1/24, 3:50 PM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
