If you would have been following our messages, you might have come across to read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation to the official invitation that was sent from our end. Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?

I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Your health is the top priority, and it's completely understandable that you may need to miss the opportunity due to your well-being. 


Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.

I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to share a sneak peek of this Wednesday's lesson, where we will be delving into the key learnings from the timeless classic, "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill.

In this session, we will explore the transformative principles outlined in the book that have guided countless individuals on their journey to success and prosperity. From the power of positive thinking and definiteness of purpose to the significance of collaboration and visualization, we will unravel the wealth of wisdom embedded in Hill's masterpiece.

Whether you're already familiar with the book or discovering it for the first time, this lesson promises to provide valuable insights that you can apply to your personal and professional life. 
Looking forward to an inspiring and insightful Wednesday session!

Best regards,
Team EWYL
