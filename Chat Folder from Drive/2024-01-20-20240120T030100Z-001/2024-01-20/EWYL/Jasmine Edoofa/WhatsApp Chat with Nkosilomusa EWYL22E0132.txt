3/1/24, 1:29 PM - +91 78886 93132: Good evening ma'am
3/1/24, 3:31 PM - +91 78886 93132: Good evening ma'am
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening Nkosilomusa
I trust this message finds you well. 
I hope your New Year was enjoyable and filled with positive experiences.
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I'm curious about how your end-of-semester exams went. Since it was your first time taking them, I'm interested in your experience. How did it go for you? 

Do you feel positive about the outcome, and do you think you'll perform exceptionally well?
3/1/24, 3:36 PM - +91 78886 93132: Okay, Regarding the exams, they were quite challenging, testing my understanding across various subjects. Despite the difficulty, I believe the rigorous preparation will yield positive results. Notably, the Aerospace Engineering Drawing exam posed a considerable challenge, demanding a comprehensive grasp of intricate concepts. I am optimistic about the outcome, as I dedicated extra effort to excel in this specific area. The difficulty served as a valuable learning experience, pushing me to refine my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of the subject matter. I am eagerly awaiting the results, confident that my hard work will reflect in improved academic performance.
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you had a chance to discuss your exams and how they went with your parents?
3/1/24, 3:38 PM - +91 78886 93132: No ma'am. I think discussing with them or not will not change anything 🤣🤣. So I just kept quiet and I'm waiting for the results.
3/1/24, 3:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Why do you say that, Nkosilomusa.
3/1/24, 3:42 PM - +91 78886 93132: They were very challenging ma'am, and I don't want to stress my parents now. It's better for them to see the results on their own than making them think that I failed and when the results comes, they see that I have passed or making them think that I did well and then the results come opposite. 
So I just decided to keep quiet 🤐
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: How often do you talk to your parents, Nkosilomusa?
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - +91 78886 93132: They text me Almost everyday but I avoid that topic 🤣. And sometimes I don't respond because they see me  as a newly born baby yet I'm turning 20 this year. I believe I'm growing and I have to keep certain things to myself and learn to solve my problem <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 3:52 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Nkosilomusa, this is a positive sign. It indicates genuine concern and care for you. If discussing exams is uncomfortable, that's completely okay. 
Keep the communication open, and do talk to them regularly
3/1/24, 3:53 PM - +91 78886 93132: Okay ma'am.
3/1/24, 3:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm sure by now, many of you have been buzzing with anticipation, having snippets of conversations with the DSW, and catching wind of something big from the team.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Nkosilomusa provided valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship Program, emphasizing the application process and the unique Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, along with the financial aspects. 

In terms of the application process, Nkosilomusa highlighted the competitive nature of the program due to its widespread popularity. To expedite the process, he offered to assist in prioritizing the evaluation of submitted forms and securing an early career counseling session with an academic expert.

Choosing Edoofa over other agents and consultants, Nkosilomusa stressed authenticity and affordability. Unlike other options, Edoofa stood out by providing continuous support beyond admission, including assistance with accommodation, registration, and documentation. Nkosilomusa's personal experience at the airport, greeted by the mentor/Edoofa team, showcased the program's commitment to student welfare.

The core of the Edoofa Program lies in its Earn While You Learn (EWYL) initiative. Nkosilomusa explained that Edoofians participate in real-time projects from industry leaders, access internship opportunities, and attend live webinars with African CEOs. The unique aspect of this program is the ability to self-finance education beyond the initial scholarship by earning credits through project work.

Nkosilomusa shared his financial journey, highlighting a 50% tuition fee reduction based on merit, extracurriculars, statement of purpose, and recommendations from senior Edoofians. He stated that the fees will range from $1500 to $3000 per annum after the scholarship. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work on projects, earning scholarship credits each month. Some seniors managed to cover their entire $2000 cost through this initiative, serving as inspiration for others.

The involvement of parents in the process was underscored, with regular updates on the student's progress. Nkosilomusa emphasized the program's unique feature of keeping parents informed at every step. Beyond financial benefits, the EWYL program provides a platform to improve skills, expand networks, and collaborate with potential future employers.

In conclusion, Nkosilomusa's messages provide a comprehensive understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, shedding light on the application process, financial aspects, and the transformative impact of the Earn While You Learn program.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Qualifying for a scholarship involves a combination of academic merit, extracurricular achievements, personal statements, and letters of recommendation. Demonstrating passion, commitment, and alignment with the scholarship's values enhances one's eligibility, making them a strong candidate for financial assistance. I believe I'm one of those students.
18/1/24, 9:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Nkosilomusa*_
I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 9:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
18/1/24, 9:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The DSW team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
18/1/24, 10:06 AM - +91 78886 93132: Good afternoon, Ms. Jasmine,

As I pen down these words, I find it challenging to express the depth of gratitude and appreciation I hold for you. The news of your decision to step down as my mentor has left a void that words alone cannot capture. Your impact on my academic journey, personal growth, and overall well-being has been nothing short of profound.

From the moment I arrived in India, leaving behind my mother in Zimbabwe, you seamlessly stepped into the role of not just a mentor but a surrogate mother. Your unwavering dedication and commitment to my development have been a guiding light through the complexities of academia, the challenges of life, and the nuances of my personal struggles.

Your influence extended far beyond the realms of academia, transcending into the very fabric of my existence. In the absence of my biological mother, you became a pillar of support, offering solace and guidance that went beyond the conventional mentor-mentee relationship. Your nurturing presence made the distance from my home more bearable, and for that, I am eternally grateful.

The impact of your mentorship has been transformative, shaping not only my academic pursuits but also molding me into the person I am today. Your wisdom, patience, and genuine care created an environment conducive to learning and growth. You were more than a mentor; you were the embodiment of maternal warmth in a foreign land.

Reflecting on the countless hours you invested in my development, I am truly humbled. Your tireless efforts to ensure my success in academia, your advice on navigating life's challenges, and your willingness to delve into my personal concerns have left an indelible mark on my journey.

As you transition from the role of my mentor, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the impact you've had on my life. Your decision leaves a significant void, but I am confident that the foundation you've helped me build will serve as a resilient structure for my future endeavors.

I extend my warmest wishes for success and fulfillment in all your future endeavors. Your achievements, particularly obtaining a Master's degree in Chemistry , serve as an inspiration and a goal that I aspire to achieve. Your legacy will continue through the lessons you've imparted and the ideals you've instilled in me.

I promise to carry forward the values and knowledge you've bestowed upon me. I aspire to be the Nkosilomusa you saw the potential in and guided toward becoming. While your departure is undoubtedly a loss, I am optimistic that life has in store for me another mentor who shares your passion, dedication, and genuine concern for my growth.

Thank you, Ms. Jasmine, for being not just a mentor but a source of strength, wisdom, and maternal care. Your influence will forever remain etched in my heart as I embark on the journey ahead, guided by the lessons you've so generously shared.

With deepest appreciation,

Nkosilomusa <This message was edited>
