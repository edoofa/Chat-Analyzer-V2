23/12/23, 5:58 PM - +91 76819 66443: Greetings, My dearest and Lovely Mentor, Ms. Jasmine ❤️
I would like to extend my warm gratitude towards your best wishes for me for this Christmas holiday which is just around the corner. 

I really appreciate you for remembering me and wishing me a Merry Christmas. 
Ms. Jasmine, I'm wishing you a Merry Christmas too💫💃🤩

As we approach this great day with so much zeal, I'm also working hard in my Earn While You Learn Program. I have learnt so many lessons from you that encourage and motivate me to keep working hard towards my dreams. From the bottom of my heart I say, everything you have done so far for me has been nothing but wonderful 😊. 

I will be sharing some application forms soon. As of now, I am rounding off the students' application eligibility test to check if they have fully understood everything regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program before I submit their Application Forms.

Once again, Thank you so much for the Merry Christmas wishes, Ms. Jasmine 💝😊

18/1/24, 11:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Kelvin
Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
18/1/24, 11:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 11:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The DSW team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

19/1/24, 3:26 AM - +91 76819 66443: Mam, I'm at a loss for words right now 😔 I'm really going to miss you. 
I had a very great time with you as my mentor and I admit that Ms. Jasmine, you taught me a lot of things that have positively impacted me to stand where I am right now. 

You have supported me from your very first day of being my mentor and your dedication to seeing my growth has been nothing but great. I really appreciate all the efforts and roles you have played in my life.

With your fruitful support and guidance, Mam I was able to pay all the fees for my semester through my credits for the first time which I strongly believe that you played a very crucial role in leveraging the same. 

I have always enjoyed working with you Mam.
However, as sometimes circumstances fall in ways that are out of our control, with a heavy heart, I acknowledge your step back from your role as my mentor.
I hope I will find a mentor who is just the same as you!

Wishing you continued success in all your future endeavours Ms. Jasmine 💝
You will always occupy a big portion in my heart 
All the best Mam ❤️
