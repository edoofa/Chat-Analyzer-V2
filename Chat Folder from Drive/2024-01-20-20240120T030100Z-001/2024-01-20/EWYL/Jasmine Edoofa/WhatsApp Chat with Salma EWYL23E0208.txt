So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
29/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 71 499 9314: It's a program that gives me projects to work on and if I'm successful then I will be able to to earn credits

5/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Okay ....I will be glad to meet her
5/1/24, 1:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
5/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 499 9314: It's nice to know her
5/1/24, 1:55 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Okay ma'am
5/1/24, 1:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
5/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Noted with thanks
5/1/24, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Noted ma'am
5/1/24, 2:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

*IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*

To make it truly memorable, let's begin by acknowledging your presence. 
Once that's done, we can dive into our session. So, what are you waiting for?
17/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 499 9314: The session
17/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 499 9314: 👆you didn't reply this
17/1/24, 1:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I am sorry. I missed your message. 
Salma, it's important to clarify that the EWYL Program isn't directly aligned with your academic pursuits in accounting. In today's competitive environment, the program aims to encourage students to go beyond their academic focus and excel in a broader sense. The projects within the EWYL Program may not directly contribute to your accounting knowledge, but they are designed to enhance your soft skills and provide valuable insights into market research. As you progress through each project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of their significance in fostering employability skills.
17/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Mmmn okay but doesn't it give pressure especially when I'm now at school. There will be assignments as well as projects for EWYL. Doesn't it give too much pressure?
17/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Fortunately, or unfortunately, we are living in a time where everybody has to go the extra mile if they want to achieve something. Yes, it can get tiring but at the end of the day if you see yourself financing your education then I know you will work hard on the projects and will manage them with your studies.
17/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Mmmm ok
17/1/24, 2:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
17/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Ok
17/1/24, 2:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
17/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Ok
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
17/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 

Instagram Username:

LinkedIn Profile Link:
17/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 499 9314: I have all of the above accounts except LinkedIn

Facebook: Salma Tinotenda
17/1/24, 3:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
17/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 499 9314: Okay
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
