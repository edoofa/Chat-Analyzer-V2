I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 11:37 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The DSW team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
