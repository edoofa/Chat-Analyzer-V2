6/1/24, 1:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Okay ma'am but I think we should reschedule our sessions because I am now going to school so afternoon sessions will be disturbed
11/1/24, 8:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day, Providence!
Hope you are well.

Okay, may I have your schedule for the school please.
11/1/24, 4:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

15/1/24, 10:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day @263785823356 ! 
Hope you are well.

Can you please share your schedule with me so that I can align our sessions?
15/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 582 3356: Afternoon ma'am I am doing great I think from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm is good as I am now at school
15/1/24, 3:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263785823356 I am afraid that my working hours are from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM, so I won't be able to accommodate to your schedule.
15/1/24, 3:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
15/1/24, 3:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com




Once done, please let me know.
19/1/24, 4:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I have been unwell and, unfortunately, wasn't able to take your session yesterday.
So to ensure that you do not miss out on anything I would like to *reschedule our session for tomorrow from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM.*
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to our rescheduled session.
19/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 78 757 9217: We hope you are doing well ma'am.Stay blessed
