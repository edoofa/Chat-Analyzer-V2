6/1/24, 10:47 AM - +91 78146 59163: I'm really excited about that spotlight. It feels scary at the same time exciting because being in front of dignitaries can be really difficult. I have experienced that before the last time we were chosen as event coordinators of that event we did before we came here.
6/1/24, 10:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I can understand that being in the spotlight can be both thrilling and a bit nerve-wracking, especially when in front of dignitaries. It's completely natural to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. However, remember that it's an excellent opportunity to showcase your skills and accomplishments. You've already had experience as an event coordinator, and that's a valuable asset. Just be yourself, and let your passion and dedication shine through. I'm confident you'll do exceptionally well!
