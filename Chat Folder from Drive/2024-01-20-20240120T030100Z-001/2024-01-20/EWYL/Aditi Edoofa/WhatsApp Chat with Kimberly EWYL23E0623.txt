5/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 634 9467: Compliments of the new year .l for one while l did go through the newsletter l did found it inspiring and actually learnt that inorder for one to be successful in what he or she does one has to be confident rather than to be discouraged by thinking that he or she can not do that very same thing .also l actually took note of how l made the right choice by being part of the edoofian family because of Mr Angad's motivational quotes which actually made me have a better insight towards my education and what l want to achieve

Great!
So we will resume our session Monday onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
19/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 77 634 9467: Okay then
