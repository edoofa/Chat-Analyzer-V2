12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 696 6271: Hie how are you I am Ms Tsitsi Mungazi  Kudakwashe 's mother

12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 696 6271: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 650 5799: My long term goal is doing a masters in my program which is medical laboratory technology I want to open my personal research institute and laboratory in Zimbabwe so that I can establish medical base and do research on medicine and mass produce medicine also built pharmacies which will sell the medicine this way I will end the problem of shortage of medicine and expensive medicine in my country
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your ambitious and impactful long-term goal. Pursuing a Master's in Medical Laboratory Technology and establishing your own research institute and laboratory in Zimbabwe reflects a commendable vision. Your plan to conduct research on medicine, mass produce it, and open pharmacies to address the shortage and affordability issues is both noble and essential. Such initiatives have the potential to significantly contribute to the healthcare sector in your country, improving accessibility to essential medicines.
12/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah that's my main goal
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I have seen and heard a lot of people die due to shortage and poor medication so I wanna change that
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's such an amazing thought!
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Please explain
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 650 5799: It's a pleasure knowing them 🙂
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes it's interesting
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Wow this is so inspiring I look forward to receiving more newsletters in the future
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes indeed it's great
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 650 5799: It's sounds pretty good
