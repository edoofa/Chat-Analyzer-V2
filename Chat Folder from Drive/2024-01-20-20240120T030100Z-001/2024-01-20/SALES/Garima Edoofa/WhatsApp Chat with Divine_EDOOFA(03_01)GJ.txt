I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
19/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 164 2713: I would be grateful if you help me to know about  the expense of comparable quality higher education for an international student without a sholarship in India.
19/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 164 2713: I will continue to take some research on people,visiting places where my carrier aspirations are to achieve them.
19/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please, Let me brief you.
19/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 3:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
19/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 164 2713: It's affordable director,very well.
19/01/24, 4:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Divine what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
19/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 164 2713: Yes ,please.
19/01/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

19/01/24, 4:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
