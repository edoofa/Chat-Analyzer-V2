The second one is in form 3 doing sciences 
The third one is in grade 6 
Then the last one is an ECD
10/01/24, 4:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Brdiget, I hope your parents are aware that you have applied for the scholarship program that would lead you to study abroad? And are they willing to support you financially in your higher education abroad?
10/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 341 4264: They are aware of that but supporting me financially is going to be hard because Zimbabwe is a hard Country and as it is right now they are struggling to send my other sisters to school hence l applied for a scholarship so that they that they are focusing on my other three sisters only relieving their stress for me
10/01/24, 4:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand bridget, but I would like to inform you that the scholarship is given on the tuition fee but apart from that there are other expenses may I know who and how will those expenses be catered?
10/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I will be working part time while l will be studying and the little that is left my parents will help
10/01/24, 4:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand, But may I know when your parents financially started to plan for your higher education abroad?
10/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Last year
10/01/24, 5:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, Bridget.

10/01/24, 5:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like you to take today's time and go through this document and discuss it with your parents as well.
10/01/24, 5:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 10 AM CAT.
Good night and god bless!
10/01/24, 9:25 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok Goodnight and God bless you too
11/01/24, 8:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263713414264 @263776332762 , Hope you are doing well.
11/01/24, 8:25 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
11/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
11/01/24, 10:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please, may I know if you have gone through this document?
11/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l have gone through it
11/01/24, 10:04 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what all you have discussed?
11/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 341 4264: We have discussed mostly about the scholarship and came to a conclusion that you will have to see a my O level results and then come to a conclusion whether l deserve the fully funded scholarship 
During that l would be doing internship for my scholarship 
As a student who only wants to study in India we did not discuss abt going to other countries like USA and Canada
They really liked the idea of earn while you learn because as a person you will gain some skills and have a sharp mind and the fact that it won’t affect my studying time
11/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 341 4264: They really appreciate that EDOOFA will assist in the application of visas so that the application goes smoothly 
They also believe in all the aspects that EDOOFA believes in so you have their full support on those ones
11/01/24, 10:24 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what exactly you mean by a fully funded scholarship?
11/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 341 4264: Whereby all the expenses are covered except for the travelling ones
11/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 341 4264: It’s the first question
11/01/24, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
11/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 341 4264: So how do you apply for sponsorship since that is what l want
11/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: Can l still get sponsorship under EDOOFA and does EDOOFA offer sponsorships
11/01/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Bridget, as the name itself justifies The EDOOFA program is a scholarship program and not a sponsorship program.
11/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok if my scholarship application is approved l would like to move forward with it and about the other expenses my parents said they will assist me with them alongside me doing internship
11/01/24, 11:34 am - Garima Edoofa: I would really appreciate it if your father is concerned about your higher education abroad. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Garima Edoofa: I see you are interested in pursuing Biomedical . Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
11/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 341 4264: My grandfather died of cancer there were no tablets that we could give so that he can be cured .....chemotherapy was very expensive to and we did not have money for that ....l don’t want someone else to suffer the same fate as my grandfather so l told myself that l would be a biomedical engineer and help discover cures for diseases that don’t have them
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am so sorry for your loss. May I know from your family or known circle if anyone pursued a career in this field?
11/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Non that l know of have
11/01/24, 12:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Great, So now I would like you to share the picture with me of your previous qualification results i.e O and A-Level results
along with the subject combination in A-level and year of passing A-level

Along with that could you please tell what desire course you wish to study?
11/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I have O levels and am planning to write my A levels this year
11/01/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Could you please share your O-level result with me, along with the subject combination in A-level?
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 341 4264: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 341 4264: A level am doing sciences 
Maths, biology and chemistry
11/01/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Along with that could you please tell what desire course you wish to study?
11/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Biomedical engineering
11/01/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have done some research regarding the same?
11/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes l have
11/01/24, 1:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please, feel free to share the information.
11/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 341 4264: In order to become a biomedical engineer, you'll need a strong foundation in the sciences, especially biology, chemistry, and physics. You'll also need to be comfortable with math and computer science, as many biomedical engineering projects involve working with data and modeling. A background in engineering, especially electrical engineering or computer engineering, is also helpful. Ultimately, though, the most important thing is to have a passion for the field and a desire to help people through the use of technology.
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well,
With your interest in the Biomedical Engineering field, may I know why you didn't opt for Physics for A level?
11/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Since it said biomedical which meant that there is biology and l could not do the two together
11/01/24, 6:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
11/01/24, 8:14 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Same to you too
11/01/24, 8:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to correct my above-shared message, we will not be connecting with you tomorrow but we will be connecting with you on Saturday. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok that is fine with me
13/01/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263776332762 @263713414264 , Hope you are doing well.
13/01/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
13/01/24, 8:56 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we are doing and you
13/01/24, 8:57 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
13/01/24, 9:06 am - Garima Edoofa: I am doing good, please.
13/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 9:15 am - Garima Edoofa: I would like to tell you that physics forms the backbone of engineering, providing the fundamental principles and laws that govern the behavior of the physical world. In engineering, a deep understanding of physics is crucial for designing, analyzing, and optimizing various systems and structures.

Mechanical engineers, for instance, leverage principles of classical mechanics to design machinery, analyze forces, and ensure structural integrity. Electrical engineers apply principles of electromagnetism and circuit theory to design electronic devices and systems. Civil engineers rely on physics to understand the properties of materials and the behavior of structures under different loads.

Furthermore, thermodynamics, a branch of physics, plays a vital role in fields like aerospace engineering and chemical engineering, where the study of heat transfer and energy transformation is essential.

In essence, physics provides the theoretical framework and mathematical tools that engineers use to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. A robust grasp of physics enhances an engineer's ability to predict and control the behavior of systems, contributing to the advancement of technology and the development of new applications.
13/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 71 341 4264: So l should have physics
13/01/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please send the picture your A-level results?
13/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 341 4264: I am writing this year
13/01/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, since you have not opted for physics May I know what other course interest you the most?
13/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 71 341 4264: Medicine
13/01/24, 11:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Well  as you mentioned it is your desire to study medicine, but, unfortunately, we don't offer medicine as a course for the following reasons:

1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive courses everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.
 
2. Eligibility: India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.
 
3. Length of the program: Medicine is a 6-8 years course including the internships(attachment) that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
 
But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses in Medical Field such as
 
1. Bachelor of Science in Nursing
2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology 
 
These courses have a lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 341 4264: What if l do physics will l be able to do biomedical engineering
13/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes if you have opted for physics in your A-level then only you are eligible to do biomedical engineering, please.
13/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 341 4264: Ok l will do physics then
13/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 341 4264: In the meantime l will choose bachelor in Physiotherapy
13/01/24, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *Monday again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
13/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Ok
13/01/24, 7:39 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Same to you
15/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 341 4264: Hello
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263713414264 @263776332762 , Hope you are doing well.
15/01/24, 9:47 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
15/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: I am doing well and u
15/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 341 4264: Yes we can start
15/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you? if yes then shall I brief you about the course?
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 341 4264: I want a course that is highly marketable so can you please advise me on which one to take according to the subjects that l am doing
15/01/24, 2:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Considering your interest there are similar courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for such as
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

*Bachelor of Science in nutrition and dietetics*

Would you like me to explain these programs to you?
15/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Yes please
15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know which course shall I brief you?
15/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 341 4264: Bachelor of Science in Microbiology
15/01/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3-year long, full-time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

16/01/24, 11:24 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Bridget

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
