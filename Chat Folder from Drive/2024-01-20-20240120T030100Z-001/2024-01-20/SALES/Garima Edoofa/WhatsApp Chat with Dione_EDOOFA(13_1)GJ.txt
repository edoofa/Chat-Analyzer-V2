Let me tell you ,Biology is a mandatory subject for medical science as it lays the background for medical courses.Therefore I regret to inform you that your combination is not eligible for Medical programs.
But may I know what other career aspirations do you have,please

I do understand ,Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics and Mathematics and chemistry in their A level mandatorily.

19/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 275 6055: There are certain requirements needed for you to do a course as you stated above
19/01/24, 3:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes correct and to do Civil engineering Chemistry is mandatory, so  may I know do you have interest in any other course?
