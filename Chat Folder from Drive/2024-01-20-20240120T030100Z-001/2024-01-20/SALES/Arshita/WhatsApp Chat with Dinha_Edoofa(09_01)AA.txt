09/01/24, 9:55 am - Arshita: Noted
09/01/24, 9:55 am - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 600 2649: Okay noted.
09/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 600 2649: Thank you.
09/01/24, 10:00 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 600 2649: I was checking on some university,not yet applied to.
09/01/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: Please understand that foreign education is just one challenge in this competitive world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth faces is employability.We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.Let me share an article that is part of our awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad. Let me know as soon as you have gone through and I will be guiding you through your program details.
09/01/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

09/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 600 2649: I'm done
09/01/24, 11:38 am - Arshita: Dinha, based on your subjects you are not eligible for pharmacy or chemical engineering as physics is a mandatory subject for these fields
09/01/24, 11:38 am - Arshita: but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

09/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 600 2649: None l think l got the context of all of them.
09/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 600 2649: Physiotherapy....

Would do.
09/01/24, 11:46 am - Arshita: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

09/01/24, 2:35 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 2:35 pm - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
09/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 600 2649: Well being able to meet a lot of different people will make me a little bit exposed to a lot of amazing things l don't know.That can help me upgrade my standard and better ideas
09/01/24, 2:40 pm - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
09/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 600 2649: No can you help me with that
09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 600 2649: Thank you for the help
09/01/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
09/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 600 2649: I will talk with my Dad abt it personally
09/01/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: By when will you have a feedback?
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 600 2649: Okay so life is becoming too hard for us and raising 2000 and above will be impossible but if by any means there is a part time job l can get to cover the expenses that would be a great thing.
09/01/24, 3:32 pm - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
09/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 600 2649: I'm sure we would find means to be able to
09/01/24, 3:34 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
09/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 77 600 2649: Can you explain further more.
09/01/24, 3:38 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/01/24, 3:38 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

10/01/24, 9:39 am - Arshita: Good Afternoon,

*“If you fell down yesterday, stand up today. H. G. Wells"*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/01/24, 4:24 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

10/01/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 600 2649: Noted.
10/01/24, 6:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 7:13 pm - +263 77 600 2649: I'm doing okay.
Hope you are fine as well


Thank you l will do my best for tomorrow's session.
11/01/24, 8:33 am - Arshita: Greetings! 
Hope you are doing well! 

Shall we continue our session?
11/01/24, 8:34 am - +263 77 600 2649: Yeah sure.
11/01/24, 8:46 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
11/01/24, 8:48 am - +263 77 600 2649: Yeah and l think they have been doing a wonderful thing and a  good background for us juniors.
11/01/24, 8:49 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 8:54 am - +263 77 600 2649: Yeah l am sure l would do my best and work hard using this EWYL program .It would actually make it more affordable and giving me experience in a lot of areas.
11/01/24, 8:54 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
11/01/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 600 2649: Fact 3
I think most of the students have been learning more and more unfortunately without knowing how to apply the information they have been taught for many years.So Edoofa being able to prepare us students for real life would be a great thing.It won't be that hard for us to get involved in the world.
11/01/24, 9:03 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

11/01/24, 9:05 am - +263 77 600 2649: Okay
11/01/24, 9:06 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 77 600 2649: My Father.
11/01/24, 9:07 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 600 2649: He's in the group l am sure he sees our conversation, though l will further discuss with him.



They are amazed about the whole thing and they are willing to help me out through it.
11/01/24, 9:11 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
11/01/24, 9:11 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
11/01/24, 9:13 am - +263 77 600 2649: No l don't know.
11/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 77 600 2649: And the statement of purpose l haven't done that one yet including the letter of recommendation.
My application form was the only thing sent.
11/01/24, 9:16 am - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/01/24, 9:16 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 600 2649: That was fact 4
Wht an amazing thing indeed
11/01/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 600 2649: Let me talk to my dad ab about it.l will give you his response.
11/01/24, 9:21 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
11/01/24, 9:21 am - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
11/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 600 2649: Okay
11/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 600 2649: How would a student know he or she is eligible?
11/01/24, 9:26 am - Arshita: The results will be out after the final interview
11/01/24, 9:27 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
11/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 600 2649: Okay.
11/01/24, 9:28 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 600 2649: Noted.
11/01/24, 9:31 am - Arshita: Please answer this
11/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 600 2649: Stage 1
Counseling
11/01/24, 9:33 am - Arshita: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you? <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 600 2649: Yes.
11/01/24, 9:40 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
11/01/24, 9:40 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
11/01/24, 9:40 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/01/24, 9:40 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
11/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 600 2649: Thank you l am clear with the process.
11/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 600 2649: Is the session done for today???
11/01/24, 9:54 am - Arshita: Yes, I will be informing you about the next stage soon
11/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 600 2649: Thank you.
Stay blessed.
11/01/24, 8:40 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
11/01/24, 8:59 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

12/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 600 2649: They wanted to know whether the schoolarship was a fully funded thing and by looking into the FAQ document l managed to explain the difference between Edoofa not being a fully funded but l getting experience through out my year's in lndia and the scholarship credits thus can help me decrease my fee as long as l am putting effort and working hard on it and the project's given to us by the Edoofian coordinator's.They wanted to know how much will it cost for me to get there since l am supposed to be funded by my parents on my coming there after the process is completed and of l am found eligible.They find this a great opportunity for my career choices and upbringing.We also discussed about it the enrollment fee and they actually said they don't have money right now but are willing to help me in everyway meaning they will work for the money and will see how it goes.
