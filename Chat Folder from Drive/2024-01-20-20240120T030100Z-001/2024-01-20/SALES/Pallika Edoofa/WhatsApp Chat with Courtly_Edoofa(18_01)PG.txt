Are you ready to begin?
18/01/24, 9:39 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings. Yes I'm ready

I am also doing well, thank you for asking!
18/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
18/01/24, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me know once added!

18/01/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 719 7155: It was for this term only will pull up
18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/01/24, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
18/01/24, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 71 719 7155: Not yet Edoofa is my first
19/01/24, 4:52 am - +263 71 719 7155: Good morning , so today I go to school and come back at 5 I don't know if your office hours will still be available
19/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
19/01/24, 11:08 am - +27 84 416 1241: Greetings, 

Courtly has gone to school so I don't know if we can do the session without her
19/01/24, 11:09 am - +27 84 416 1241: And she will only be free after 5pm  and tomorrow
19/01/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, You can also have the session on Courtly's  behalf! <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!!
