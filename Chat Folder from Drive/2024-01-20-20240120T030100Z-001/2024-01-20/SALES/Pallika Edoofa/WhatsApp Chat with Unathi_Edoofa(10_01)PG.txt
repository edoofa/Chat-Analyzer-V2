12/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 982 1563: Because I was still getting used to the pressure plus the teachers didn't give us so much attention becoz of the outgoing upper sixes
12/01/24, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Unathi!
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 982 1563: not yet.... I was still looking for scholarships and I'm trying by all means to achieve high standards
12/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 78 982 1563: okay thanks

15/01/24, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Unathi, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.

15/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 982 1563: yess
15/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

First, the diverse curriculum and different perspectives offered by Indian universities could help me gain a broader understanding of the world. Second, studying in India would give me the opportunity to build connections with people from different backgrounds and cultures. And third, it could help me stand out from other candidates in the job market, as it would demonstrate my willingness to explore new experiences and challenges.
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! You've highlighted some fantastic points. Studying in India can indeed offer a diverse and enriching experience, providing a broader perspective, fostering valuable connections, and enhancing your marketability in the professional world. It's an exciting prospect!
15/01/24, 5:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
15/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 78 982 1563: thanks 😊
15/01/24, 5:54 pm - +263 78 982 1563: noo
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay, as I was having my dinner.
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
15/01/24, 8:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 9:57 pm - +263 78 982 1563: okay I understand

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
17/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 437 5384: Hello Good morning sorry about yesterday Unathi was out of data that's she did not attend the session, but I have send her airtime so she will be available as soon she recharge her Phone thank yu

17/01/24, 10:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: so, Shall we continue?
17/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 437 5384: Ok, we can do session but am not good in English language so will try my best
17/01/24, 11:51 am - +27 76 581 5188: yes
17/01/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!!!
17/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through the previous continue,  Please address this.
17/01/24, 12:12 pm - +27 76 581 5188: good girl
17/01/24, 12:13 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes it's affordable
17/01/24, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
17/01/24, 12:21 pm - +27 76 581 5188: no we do not know
17/01/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/01/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
17/01/24, 12:43 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes it creates exposure , knowledge to know what you would be before and after completing your educational journey
17/01/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 12:53 pm - +27 76 581 5188: indeed it comes with relief to the family
17/01/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
17/01/24, 1:37 pm - +27 76 581 5188: all four of them they bring out the best combination of Edoofa, which is why we pray and hope uNathi will get a chance with Edoofa Scholarship
17/01/24, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

17/01/24, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/01/24, 1:42 pm - +27 76 581 5188: Ok
17/01/24, 1:45 pm - +27 76 581 5188: i will be helping her with the remaining fee
17/01/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's understandable, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
17/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 76 581 5188: it's a previlage to the family and hope she's be able to secure a job after completing her educational studies
17/01/24, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
17/01/24, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
17/01/24, 2:10 pm - +27 76 581 5188: No we do not
17/01/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/01/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:25 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes
17/01/24, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
17/01/24, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
17/01/24, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
17/01/24, 2:32 pm - +27 76 581 5188: thank you, when can she apply?
17/01/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As we are about to end today's session and after that Unathi's application will be proceeded to Stage 2
17/01/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:08 pm - +27 76 581 5188: Stage 2
17/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
17/01/24, 4:10 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 4:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Mr. Maduma?
17/01/24, 4:42 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes we are
17/01/24, 4:43 pm - +27 76 581 5188: Ok noted
17/01/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

18/01/24, 9:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Unathi, The most important process of your eligibility check stage is your scholarship interview with the Program Director at Edoofa. Shall I share the schedule for the same?
18/01/24, 9:20 pm - +263 78 982 1563: yes
18/01/24, 9:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Will you and your parents can be available at 11:00 AM CAT Tomorrow for your final interview with a stable network to send and download WhatsApp voice notes?
18/01/24, 9:22 pm - +27 76 581 5188: won't be available for the couple of days, sorry!!
18/01/24, 9:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know when will you be available then?
18/01/24, 9:25 pm - +27 76 581 5188: will let you know
18/01/24, 9:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving, it would be greatly appreciated if you could respond to be considered for a scholarship seat. 

Also, Please note that it will be a short video call that takes hardly 05-10 minutes!
18/01/24, 9:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, will you manage to do so?
18/01/24, 9:27 pm - +27 76 581 5188: yes
18/01/24, 9:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Shall I schedule at this time?
18/01/24, 9:29 pm - +27 76 581 5188: let's say Tuesday
18/01/24, 9:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Maduma, That will be little late, please consider this too
18/01/24, 9:33 pm - +27 76 581 5188: uNathi and her mother will do it on behalf of me,as i will be away for couple of days
19/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
19/01/24, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Will you and your parents can be available at 11:00 AM CAT Today for your final interview with a stable network to send and download WhatsApp voice notes?
19/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 437 5384: Good morning sorry for late response,Unathi is on lessons now and she will be available after school over because phones are now allowed the father is not available
19/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Unathi?*
19/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 437 5384: Ok I understand are we going to use watsup call or voice notes
19/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 437 5384: Will prepare to use voice note because of network challenges
19/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: There will be a short video call!
19/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 78 982 1563: okay
19/01/24, 9:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, shall I schedule it for you?
