From grade 3 until O level she has been 💯 under my care and did very well in her O’level .

10/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 78 721 3996: Excuse my phone , it is acting up 🙏

10/01/24, 10:11 am - +27 78 721 3996: Kindly specify which term results for which year , thank you
10/01/24, 10:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: You can share any of the term results of A level so that I can guide a specific course for the same
10/01/24, 10:13 am - +27 78 721 3996: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
10/01/24, 10:14 am - +27 78 721 3996: She started late her lower 6 and couldn’t catch up but l know this year she will excel it .
She’s a brilliant girl and passionate about her academics
10/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I am glad to know that!
10/01/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
10/01/24, 10:19 am - +27 78 721 3996: No
10/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:54 am - +27 78 721 3996: Got it.
10/01/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, To offer a course I would like to know career aspirations of Chantel
10/01/24, 11:02 am - +27 78 721 3996: As l mentioned earlier , she is at school at the moment and l believe she is the right person to answer this .

Thank you
10/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
10/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: I will be waiting!
10/01/24, 11:05 am - +27 78 721 3996: I mentioned something here as well .
10/01/24, 11:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Ncube, thank you for sharing this, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.
10/01/24, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Shall I explain the course in depth?
10/01/24, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

18/01/24, 9:46 am - +27 78 721 3996: Yes 👏
18/01/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Ms. Ncube, as per her interest in these Fields, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students
While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.
18/01/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Shall I explain *BCOM* in depth?
18/01/24, 9:48 am - +27 78 721 3996: She’s the one who needs this , she will make her own choice .
Thank you
18/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me explain the course for her and she can go through it later!
