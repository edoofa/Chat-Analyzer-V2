I welcome you to this session.

I am *Ms. Pallika*, and am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin* and *Mr. Piiyush*, our Senior Career Counsellors, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Munyaradzi* from Zimbabwe


I would like you to come online at *09:30 AM CAT Today* so that I can discuss with you the Scholarship opportunities for there higher education abroad. <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
17/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 327 1212: Can we schedule the meeting to a later date like in April when the schools close because currently he is not available
17/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 327 1212: He attends a boarding school where cellphones are not allowed
17/01/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Jack, I understand, since schools in Zimbabwe have reopened, students are currently engaged in lessons and exam preparations, rendering them unavailable. This situation contrasts with Western African countries where students have already received their results. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that scholarship seats could be filled by students from these regions, posing a potential disadvantage for Zimbabwean students.

These factors particularly affect boarding students and those who are restricted from using devices in school. By the time they return, the opportunity may have been taken by other applicants. To address this concern, our Academic Board, in consultation with universities, has decided to allow parents to participate in the seat reservation interview for their children. This ensures that no deserving applicant is overlooked.
17/01/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: So as of now parents do have a chance in representing their child under the evaluation process, so would it be possible for us to have a discussion regarding the same please?
17/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 327 1212: Yes it's possible can we have discussion tomorrow at 10
17/01/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Jack, Please let me know once availabel!
17/01/24, 5:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
