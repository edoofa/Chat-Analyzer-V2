17/01/24, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
17/01/24, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Pamela, Are we connected?

I was expecting your response so that I can share with you the way to *self-finance your higher education and lessen the burden on your parents!*
17/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 630 3800: No it is not affordable
17/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
17/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 630 3800: No l do not
17/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 78 630 3800: I think it's a great idea
So lf l join the earn while you learn program averagely how much can I earn?
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Yes l think so
17/01/24, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
17/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Yes l realize it now
17/01/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
17/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Affordability through guaranteed scholarships
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

17/01/24, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 630 3800: My mom
17/01/24, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Pamela, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 630 3800: They are okay with it
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
17/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 630 3800: No  l don't
17/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please note When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Yes
17/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
17/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
17/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
17/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
17/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Okay
17/01/24, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Stage one personalized counselling session
17/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
17/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
17/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Yes
17/01/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
17/01/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/01/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

17/01/24, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Pamela, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

17/01/24, 4:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know your query, Pamela!
17/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Estimate the total cost of studying with Edoofa abroad
17/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Pamela, Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by an Edoofian through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
17/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
17/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear now!


Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
17/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 630 3800: No thank you
17/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this document too
17/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It was an honor to host the session today with you!
As a consequence of my satisfaction with your replies and performance thus far, please allow me to advance your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.

Your next session is at *11:30 a.m. CAT Tomorrow (18/01/2024)* where I will analyze your application and take you through the most critical Eligibility Check Stage. 

Make sure to come on time after having a thorough discussion with your family, and the parents/guardians of the applicant are highly encouraged to be online for the following session as higher education is a family decision.
 
Stay Blessed!
Happy Family Discussion
18/01/24, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Pamela, and Ms. Patricia,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
18/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 630 3800: Yes
18/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Pamela,
I hope you are doing well
18/01/24, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
18/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 630 3800: I'm doing great
18/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 630 3800: Yes
18/01/24, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
18/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 630 3800: They thought that it is a great program and are looking forward to get to the next stage of  learning more about this program.
18/01/24, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. May I know if your family has any queries, please
18/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 630 3800: They wanted to ask how much a visa to India can cost
18/01/24, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: The visa process will be *$83 which is to be borne by the student*. However, we will be guiding you on the same!
18/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 630 3800: How much is the transportation?
18/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 630 3800: How much  can the fees be per semester after evaluation
18/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 630 3800: Is the fees a once off payment?
18/01/24, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Pamela, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
18/01/24, 11:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Have you considered this payment plan?
18/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 630 3800: Okay l'll consider it
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
18/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 630 3800: ?
18/01/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Pamela, the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
18/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Okay
18/01/24, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if your family has any queries, please
18/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 630 3800: No they don't
18/01/24, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 630 3800: They feel like it's too much
18/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 630 3800: my mom is the one who caters for my fees so  the fees are too much for her
18/01/24, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have you discuss the same with her as well?
18/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 630 3800: This message was deleted
18/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 630 3800: Yes
18/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 353 2662: Hie madam 
I'm Pamela's mom, we discussed yesterday but my challenge is the fees seems to be too much for me but l wanted my daughter to study abroad and make her dreams of being a Lawyer come true
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ms. Patricia,
I hope that you are doing well.
18/01/24, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
18/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 353 2662: I'm fine thanks
18/01/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Ms. Patricia?
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 353 2662: Edoofa Scholarship Program is good but the beginning I  mean money needed for the student eg enrollment fee, flight and semester fee.for me it's too much considering what l earn☺️
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Ms. Patricia, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
18/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 353 2662: I understand that but here in Zimbabwe lm being paid using our local currency so I have to change it into USD and my month salary is equivalen t to enrollment fee ☺️ so lm afraid maybe l may not be able to meet your required amount for the semester
18/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 353 2662: But my wish l wanted my daughter to study abroad
18/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 630 3800: We thank you for giving an opportunity to learn about Edoofa  but due to financial problems we wont be able to meet the demands e.g
The flight fee, semester fee
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Patricia, as I have shared with you looking at Pamela's results she would be eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship resulting in the annual fee to be $1200-$1800. 

Now beyond this, your child would have the opportunity of the Earn While You Learn Program, even if she earns $50-$100 a month, her effective annual fee that would be left to be catered by the family will be $600-$1000 a year, which is lower than the fee that would be applicable in UZ itself.
18/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 353 2662: It's ok thank you let me raise money for enrollment and flight
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 353 2662: After her arrival in India how much is needed for her to open an account and how much will l be putting into the account per month
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 353 2662: $600- 1000 divide by 6 months 🤷‍♀️
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I think there is a misunderstanding over here, I am talking about the Annual fee (yearly fee) not the semester fee, please.
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Annual fee after scholarship will be between $1200-$1800. Beyond this you would have EWYL's assistance please.
18/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 353 2662: Ok l think l understand now.
Thank you for the explanation
18/01/24, 1:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!

18/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 353 2662: No
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career

The program allows students to study while they earn money while you learn and also prepare you for the world . ln this earn while you learn program one earns money through scholarship credits and there is no limit to earning.The scholarship credits are equivalent to physical cash and can be used to pay part of the higher education fees.the earn while you learn program is good because it does not hinder one from attaining their goals but helps them to attain their goals through earning which does not disrupt school work .
