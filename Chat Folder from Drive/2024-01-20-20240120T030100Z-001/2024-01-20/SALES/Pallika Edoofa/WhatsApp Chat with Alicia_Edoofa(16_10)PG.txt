06/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 780 2703: OK
06/11/23, 6:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?

06/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Alicia, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

06/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 780 2703: My mum will budget for it
06/11/23, 6:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that,


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 780 2703: No and l will love to work while studying
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

06/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes l think l will benefit
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
06/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 780 2703: OK l understand
06/11/23, 6:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Alicia, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 780 2703: 3...the earn while you earn.. Point
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!

06/11/23, 6:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
06/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 780 2703: My mother with the help of my aunts
06/11/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 780 2703: They will be very proud
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 780 2703: If l am to get the scholarship
06/11/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alicia, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
06/11/23, 7:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
06/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes
1.Application form
2.the zeal to advance in life wit a better career
3.visa
4.some money to start a life
5..three people to act as reference to my character
06/11/23, 7:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's correct!!!

Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
06/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
06/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes please do
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 780 2703: What if l want to use my O level results?
06/11/23, 7:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alicia, it's important to note that both your O-level and A-level results were considered and evaluated.
06/11/23, 7:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 780 2703: My A level results will be out in February, are we going to wait for the results next year?
06/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alicia, it's important to know that for the current stage of the process, we are considering your O-level and term results. Once your A-level results become available, they will also be included in your application. Additionally, your application procedure and participation in the EWYL sessions will continue.
06/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Am not sure but aren't we not on stage 2 cause l understand you said am not eligible for the pham and medical sciences but l am for the BA in Geography
06/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 780 2703: OK that's great
06/11/23, 7:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, Alicia, as I mentioned earlier, your subject combination doesn't make you eligible for the desired course. The suitable option for you would be to consider pursuing a BA in Geography. I hope it is clear now <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 7:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
06/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes it is you have made it so clear thank you so much
06/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes please
06/11/23, 7:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
06/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes l am
06/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 780 2703: U said am on stage 1 now what is needed for me to get to stage 2
06/11/23, 7:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Alicia!!
06/11/23, 7:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Alicia, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*

10/12/23, 9:18 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
10/12/23, 9:18 pm - Austin: Dear parents ,Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Let me know if you have any challenges.
10/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Gud evening.. Thank you for your efforts.. Yes I can raise the us$200 in 7 days and the us$150 in 30 days..
10/12/23, 10:06 pm - Austin: This is well noted,  If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child tomorrow it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the beginning of the fourth week of December. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
10/12/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Fo  the visa..? Am I the one who is going to pay fo it.. O it's included in the us$350?
10/12/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Meaning I will be paying during the Christmas week..? 25-30th of December u mean?
10/12/23, 10:14 pm - Austin: The visa application fee is $83 which is supposed to be paid by you and our Admissions team will be guiding you through the visa process thereby simplifying it for you
10/12/23, 10:14 pm - Austin: No please, between 19-22nd December
11/12/23, 4:59 am - +263 77 780 2703: Besides the visa..the us$350.. Is there any other fee payable by the parent? ..
11/12/23, 5:00 am - +263 77 780 2703: OK I think I can manage
16/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Gud evening
22/12/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 5:21 am - +263 77 780 2703: Gud evening.. Thank you
06/01/24, 8:29 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Gud evening
18/01/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
How are you doing?
18/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Im gud... How are you,?
18/01/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
18/01/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for delay as I was occupied with the evaluations as A level results are out currently!
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know that have you managed the enrollment fees?
18/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes I have
18/01/24, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Alicia?*
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 780 2703: Yes

18/01/24, 8:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
So, Before scheduling a seat reservation call, Can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same? <This message was edited>
