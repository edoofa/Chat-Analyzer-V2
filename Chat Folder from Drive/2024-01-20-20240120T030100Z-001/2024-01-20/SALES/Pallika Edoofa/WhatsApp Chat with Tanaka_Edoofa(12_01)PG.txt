13/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
13/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today.
13/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/01/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

13/01/24, 10:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 696 5955: I'm done
13/01/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
13/01/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

15/01/24, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued for Tanaka to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your child's career and help your child achieve your goals?
15/01/24, 8:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 9:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone, 
How are you all doing today?

Shall we begin our session?
16/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 78 948 8360: We are fine
16/01/24, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the inactiveness in the previous session?
16/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 948 8360: I will be busy I'm at work so I usually come online there and there
16/01/24, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that!!
16/01/24, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
16/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Studying abroad helps him to learn different things that he learnt here and helps him grow educationally and I understand that there are materials that are there that we don't have here in Zimbabwe so it becomes easy when it comes to education practically for Tanaka

And studying abroad has always been on of his achievement that he wants in life i personally would like also 

It will help us financially as a family since my parents and him have lived their lives in the village having poor background so if he gets a chance to study abroad and have a stable job he will help the family rise from the dust
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Faith, It's wonderful to hear about Tanaka's aspirations to study abroad and the potential benefits for his educational growth. The access to diverse materials and opportunities abroad can indeed be transformative. I wish Tanaka the best in achieving his dream, and I hope it brings positive changes not only for him but for your family's financial stability as well.
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alos, I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
16/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Mmm i don't know the costs of higher education for an International student
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 948 8360: To be honest with you now the person who used to pay for Tanaka's school fees she is now on pension so that cost of money it's not affordable to the family our biological parents don't go to work and me I'm still on attachment I don't get any pay because I'm still at school also so that's why Tanaka was actually looking for a scholarship so that he gets the opportunity to continue going to school 

So basically he needs a scholarship that will help him with the education and money to pay for all the bills
16/01/24, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
16/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 948 8360: How??
16/01/24, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/01/24, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/01/24, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
16/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Yes I guess will benefit from the earn while you learn program
16/01/24, 5:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Yes sure there are some benefits
16/01/24, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
16/01/24, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
16/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Expert Career Counseling and earn while you learn
16/01/24, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

16/01/24, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 78 948 8360: I don't know but I think my mum's sister
16/01/24, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's understandable, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
16/01/24, 6:02 pm - +263 78 948 8360: It will be great for him and the rest of us
16/01/24, 6:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
16/01/24, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
16/01/24, 6:06 pm - +263 78 948 8360: those are the requirements that i know as well
16/01/24, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/01/24, 6:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 6:09 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Are you telling me that for him to answer those questions like the statement of purpose he has to pay ??
16/01/24, 6:10 pm - +263 78 948 8360: We can discuss that tomorrow when I'm free I'm now busy at the moment
16/01/24, 6:11 pm - +263 78 948 8360: By the way who is supposed to pay for the enrollment fee
16/01/24, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No, Ms. Faith, That is the fees that have to be paid by the student if he/she applies on there own!
16/01/24, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This reduced fees has to be paid by the student and there family as The Edoofa Scholarship program provides the scholarship!
16/01/24, 6:14 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Oh okay but Tanaka isn't applying on his own thou that's why he looked for a scholarship isn't it
16/01/24, 6:18 pm - +263 78 948 8360: What?? When you say Edoofa only provides scholarship you mean you only provide for a student to be enrolled only,  the rest of the expenses he faces alone??
16/01/24, 6:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.
16/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 78 948 8360: On this one you are saying the student provide the living and the transportation which is reasonable but on the statement above you mentioned that the remaining costs such as enrollment fee it's catered by the student tho so which is which
16/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 78 948 8360: For now I'm now busy will talk tomorrow good day
17/01/24, 9:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
17/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 78 948 8360: Fine and you i will reply there and there I'm a little busy I'm at work
17/01/24, 9:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: yes That's right!
17/01/24, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Noted!
17/01/24, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that we are about to end the session!
17/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 78 948 8360: Okay
17/01/24, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:22 am - +263 78 948 8360: 1,3,4,5,6
17/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
17/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 78 948 8360: Yes
17/01/24, 9:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
17/01/24, 9:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
17/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 948 8360: Yes
17/01/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
17/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 948 8360: No not yet
17/01/24, 1:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
17/01/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Faith, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
17/01/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
18/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 948 8360: Okay yes
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Faith,
I hope you are doing well
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
18/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 948 8360: It's a good program
I don't have questions
18/01/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career.

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 948 8360: Financial aspects as in??
18/01/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Faith, as I have mentioned here about the enrollment fees, Let me share with you *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
18/01/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
18/01/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
18/01/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
