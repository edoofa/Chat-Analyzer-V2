19/01/24, 9:30 am - +265 991 59 81 60: Good morning
Edoofa has played an important role to reduce the cost to $2000 -$3000. The comfort comes in because of the Earn while you learn program. Looking at Joseph's strong passion for  Education in addition to his hard working spirit and good behavior ,as a family we are prepared to do everything possible to offer him support both financial and moral for him to achieve his goal.
Having said that I am personally committed to do what is humanly possible within my limit as a parent as Edoofa has already demonstrated the compassionate and supportive role by substantial cost reduction.
19/01/24, 9:41 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We have discussed this issue as a family, we are all committed and determined. Joseph is determined and ready to seize this opportunity, he understands our financial position he promises to work very hard excited with the Earn while you learn program as a window of opportunity to over come the financial stumbling block to his much needed Education career
19/01/24, 9:57 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing?
19/01/24, 9:59 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We are fine thank you and how are you?
19/01/24, 10:09 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
19/01/24, 10:10 am - Kunal: I see you have well understood everything
So, may I know if you are comfortable with every aspect to proceed ahead?
19/01/24, 10:14 am - +265 991 59 81 60: We may proceed thank you.
19/01/24, 10:36 am - Kunal: Alright please
I have also noted that Joseph is well motivated towards this career path in Medicine and looking forward to excelling in it

What motivated him towards this career goal?
19/01/24, 11:39 am - +265 991 59 81 60: I have been discussing with Joseph on why he has a strong passion to study medicine. The first response was his compassion for the sick struggling to raise money for special medical attention .This motivated Joseph to love sciences and mathematics and made him study hard to pass with distinctions. He understands fully the need to do well in sciences for him to be a surgeon. And that helping sick people indefatigably   requires hard working spirit and a compassionate heart.
19/01/24, 11:51 am - +265 991 59 81 60: I can testify as a parent that to study medicine is not an impulse decision to Joseph but part of his long term plan. All his academic studies is meant to achieve this goal of becoming a surgeon  help the sick in need of specialized attention.
19/01/24, 12:03 pm - Kunal: It's truly inspiring to learn about Joseph's strong passion for studying medicine. His initial motivation, driven by compassion for those struggling to afford special medical attention, speaks volumes about his empathy and dedication
It's evident that Joseph's motivation goes beyond personal success, focusing on making a positive impact on the lives of others.
19/01/24, 12:04 pm - Kunal: So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me his previous qualification results i.e MSCE results, please?

19/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: As you mentioned that it is Joseph's desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because a student needs to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible. At the same time, I do acknowledge his strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which he is eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*4) Bachelor of Optometry*
*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
19/01/24, 2:28 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Thank you for the options I strongly believe that they are equally helpful and important. I would appreciate you brief explanation on the above
19/01/24, 2:31 pm - Kunal: May I know which course do you wish me to explain?
19/01/24, 2:34 pm - +265 991 59 81 60: Excuse me my apologies only 1 percent of power left
19/01/24, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Ensure to let me know once you are back
19/01/24, 4:22 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:00 am CAT Tuesday to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation.
