08/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 613 6484: Olk let me try, 
My name is Munyaradzi Christwish Chiduwa ,turning 22 years on the 17th this very month . I come from a family of  3 children being the middle one . I attended my primary education in many schools due to some family movements but I finally did my grade 7 at Sharara Primary School located in Nyazura ,Manicaland . I got my 5 units at that school. 
From there l started Secondary education at Sharara Secondary where I just did one year . Form 2 I moved to Chiota ,in Mashonaland where I even did my Olevel at Furamera Secondary school where I did 10 subjects and I passed them all . I stayed for the whole year after Olevel due to financial disturbance plus I struggled to get a place to start my Alevel because many school were not allowing me to do Sciences because at O level I didn't do pure sciences for the school did not offer that . But finally l moved to Bulawayo where I stay with my Pastor who helped me to start A level and l got enrolled in July 2022 at Beacon of life institute and they offered me a combination of Maths , Physics and Chemistry since I have the zeal to study medicine. Since my parents could not finance my education I saw this scholarship program as a chance to go on for I am currently waiting for my A level results .  At Beacon of life the fees was $58 per month plus $50 for levies which was per term .
