16/01/24, 11:01 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
16/01/24, 11:02 am - Kunal: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
16/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 897 1205: Yes i am
16/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: So, may I know if you are inclined towards any specific course in the field of graphic designing?

16/01/24, 11:37 am - Kunal: Alright Tawanda

17/01/24, 11:19 am - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests and passion, you are eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)*
