Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives. 

So I am here to begin with your application 

How are you this morning?

03/01/24, 1:05 pm - Kunal: It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:

*“If you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” ―Wayne Dyer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 327 7905: Yes sir
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: Please address this
04/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 327 7905: 1. The profession I admire the most is being a neurosurgeon, and i have approached my final year in high school. Unfortunately,  in Zimbabwe,  doctors are not paid enough. Furthermore,  the medicine course taught in Zimbabwe is below par compared to other countries. Therefore, those who do medicine in Zimbabwe don't stand a chance in the global job market.  As you may have known or heard,  Zimbabwe's economic structure is in shambles . My hope is to study abroad, which leads me to another reason. My family's financial status is unable to afford me studying abroad. Understanding this made me opt for scholarship opportunities.  India is renowned for producing and having the best doctors in the world. A prime example is Dr. Sandeep Vaishya , a prominent neurosurgeon currently working in Fotis Memorial Research Institute.  
2. From the program,  so far, I have understood that this is a huge opportunity to help me pursue my career. To add on, I have come to realize that this is a legit scholarship program, unlike other fake programs .
04/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 327 7905: Any questions?
04/01/24, 11:22 am - Kunal: It's evident that you hold a deep passion for becoming a neurosurgeon, a noble and challenging profession. Your decision to seek education abroad aligns with the pursuit of excellence and exposure to global standards in the medical field.

Let me help you understand more about the Edoofa program

04/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 327 7905: Thank you  very much , Mr Kunal. I look forward to further proceedings.

Alright so, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad*
*8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?*
04/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 327 7905: I am in U6 doing Mathematics, Biology,  Physics and Chemistry. I wish to study medicine as it is essential to me being a surgeon . All the more, I want to be able to save lives and be a wall between a patient's life and death. Zimbabwe has poor medical standards, and as a result,  the death rates in our country are high. The plan is to become a renowned surgeon and open up multiple public hospitals in, not only Zimbabwe but Africa as a whole.
My father is a Professional Disaster Risk Management practitioner and my mother,  a GIS specialist. 
My father's highest qualification is Doctorate in the field mentioned above, and my mother has a degree . I am blessed with 3 brothers( 2 older,  1 younger). The 2 older brothers recently finished their A Level and are waiting to proceed to tertiary education.  My young brother is currently in Form 3 . My father has been the one financially supporting my education this far.  My father is supposed to support , financially,  my tertiary education abroad, but , unfortunately,  he will not be able to afford international fees, hence why I am applying for a fully funded scholarship. Originally,  my school fee was $1300 , however, due to my excellent performance in the IGCSE level, the school awarded me a discount of $800. 

In my free time, I love to play football . I am also well oriented in chess and athletics. On some occasions,  I find myself relaxed by taking evenings strolls around my neighborhood . I often  play video games after a long and intense study session.
I am blessed with determination and discipline, extraordinary virtues craved by many individuals of my age . My mother always says that I'm someone who is well versed in handling pressure. <This message was edited>

Schools are opening tomorrow, and it's imperative that I finish preparing for the school term . I have a proposal. Is it possible that we derive a flexible timetable  as I will not always be available once the school term starts?
04/01/24, 3:32 pm - Kunal: May I know at what time you will be available?
04/01/24, 8:44 pm - +263 78 327 7905: Pardon me, it seems like I didn't quite explain myself.  Allow me to elaborate.
I am going to school tomorrow, and I won't be able to proceed further with the sessions until I come back from school.  Perhaps we  could schedule the session tomorrow morning ( around 11 a.m.) . I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this.

05/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 950 6505: If l may jump in am Pathias,  Rufaro's the dad. My honest response to your enquiry is that if Rufaro  gets awarded a 100 percent scholarship on tuition, l will try my best to raise money to fund his other remaining expenses.
05/01/24, 11:26 am - Kunal: Alright Mr. Pathias

05/01/24, 11:49 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 327 7905: Understood
05/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 327 7905: I have a question. 
What is the pass mark, for a subject,  by Edoofa standards?
05/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: Rufaro, let me tell you that the minimum requirement is two A-level passes only
05/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 327 7905: Okay.
05/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 327 7905: Well... in that case,  I am more than confident.
05/01/24, 12:09 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*4) Bachelor of Optometry*
*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you? <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 12:33 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

19/01/24, 10:56 am - Kunal: Well noted
Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
19/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 261 1104: Yes
19/01/24, 11:00 am - Kunal: .*Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
