17/01/24, 1:07 pm - Kunal: Obey, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:
1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with Munyaradzi?
17/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 425 3837: From a young age, I have been captivated by the intricate tapestry of cultures that make up our world. The allure of understanding different perspectives, the drive to contribute positively to global communities, and the pursuit of academic excellence have all coalesced into a singular ambition: to become a part of the EDOOFA movement. My motivation to join EDOOFA is rooted in three core areas: a commitment to global citizenship, a passion for experiential learning, and a desire to be an agent of change.

Firstly, EDOOFA's mission to make education a force to unite people, nations, and cultures for peace and a sustainable future resonates deeply with my personal values. The concept of global citizenship – the idea that one's identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from being a part of a broader human community – is a principle I have always aspired to embody. The opportunity to  live and learn alongside students from diverse backgrounds at EDOOFA is not just an educational experience; it is a chance to develop a nuanced understanding of the world, to build bridges across divides, and to foster a sense of shared humanity.

Secondly, EDOOFA's unique educational model, which emphasizes experiential learning, aligns with my belief that education should extend beyond the confines of a traditional classroom. I am eager to engage in the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, known for its rigorous academic standards and its emphasis on critical thinking and intercultural understanding. Beyond academics, EDOOFA's emphasis on community service, outdoor activities, and creative arts promises a holistic learning environment where I can grow intellectually, physically, and emotionally. I am motivated by the prospect of learning through doing, of being challenged, and of stepping out of my comfort zone to gain skills and insights that are not possible through textbooks alone.

Finally, my motivation to join EDOOFA is fueled by a desire to contribute to a better world. EDOOFA's commitment to social responsibility and sustainability aligns with my aspiration to be an agent of change. I am inspired by the idea of collaborating with like-minded peers. I also enjoy developing the world and leaving no one behind. I'm also a philanthropist, a leader who leaves no stone unturned and this cannot manifest without joining the EDOOFA .
17/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 425 3837: 2.The EDOOFA movement, with its unique educational philosophy and commitment to international understanding, has long intrigued me. As an institution that brings together young people from diverse backgrounds, UWC schools embody an ethos of peace, sustainability, and social justice that resonates deeply with my personal values. In this essay, I will explore the aspects of EDOOFA schools and ideals that captivate my interest and align with my aspirations for a better world.

Firstly, at the heart of EDOOFA's mission is the cultivation of global citizenship. The idea of being part of a global community, where one's actions contribute to the greater good, is both empowering and humbling . This melting pot of perspectives is not just an academic exercise; it is a lived experience that shapes the worldview of every student, including myself.

The emphasis on cultural understanding and respect is particularly appealing to me. In a world often divided by differences, EDOOFA  stand as beacons of hope, demonstrating that it is possible to create a cohesive community out of diversity. The opportunity to engage with peers from various backgrounds would not only broaden my horizons but also challenge me to re-evaluate my own preconceptions and biases.

Secondly, EDOOFA's educational model goes beyond traditional classroom learning. The emphasis on experiential education means that students are encouraged to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts. This hands-on approach to learning is something that I find particularly exciting. Whether it is through community service, outdoor challenges, or artistic endeavors, EDOOFA students are pushed to develop practical skills and a sense of responsibility towards their communities.

The schools' commitment to social engagement aligns with my desire to make a tangible impact on society. EDOOFA's ethos encourages students to become change-makers, to take initiative, and to lead projects that address local and global issues. This proactive stance on social change is not only inspiring but also offers a platform for students like me to contribute meaningfully to the world around us.

Lastly, another aspect of EDOOFA that draws my interest is its dedication to sustainability and environmental stewardship. In the face of climate change and environmental degradation, EDOOFA schools prioritize ecological consciousness and actions.
17/01/24, 1:32 pm - Kunal: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.

17/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 425 3837: Tafireyi's Biography

Born on the 1st of May, 2006 in the bustling city of Harare in small town called Chitungwiza , Zimbabwe. I entered the world as a beacon of hope for my family. My parents, who have always been my pillars of strength named me Obey Isheanesu Tafireyi . My father, a dedicated flea market owner  and my mother, a resourceful small business owner, instilled in me the value of education , philanthropy and community service from a very young age.

My academic journey began in 2013 at Budirirai Seke 5 Primary , a local school where I went for my first grade and quickly developed a love for learning , helping others and leading students until they achieve what they want. Despite financial constraints, my parents ensured that I received the best education they could afford. In 2016, I was awarded a partial scholarship that covered half of my tuition fees, a testament to my academic performance and my family's commitment to my schooling. This helped me to excel my seventh grade in 2019 , I had six units. Through this , everyone one admired me since I was the headboy at that school. I did what real leaders do, I led by example.

After graduating from primary school with honors, I transitioned to  Zengeza 1 High School, where I did my first and second year of my secondary education. At Zengeza 1 , I became a prefect in my second year. I also introduced a junior quiz club at that school .I then moved to Moonrise College because of some financial difficulties . Here, I have continued to excel academically, particularly in the commercials and arts. I then wrote eight subjects on my O level. This was due to lack of financial assistance because I did not manage to register as many subjects as I wanted in order to fulfill my goals , I then took the major ones. I wrote Mathematics, Combined Science, English language, Shona language, Commerce , History , Heritage and Family and Religious Studies (FRS). I did this because I really like law and Business management . My school has recognised my potential by providing me with a bursary that covers a portion of my educational expenses, easing the financial burden on my family. So as for my A level , my first choice subjects are Mathematics, Computer science, Economics, Business studies . I aiming to be a data scientists as time moves on . Since the sky is the limit, I will also go for a forensic audit degree. This is due to my commitment, I leave no stone unturned when it comes to hard work.

Further more, I hail from a close-knit family that values togetherness and resilience. We live in a modest home on the outskirts of Chitungwiza in unit A and we come from Masvingo. In our area where community ties are strong, and neighbors support each other through thick and thin. My parents' hard work and dedication to our family's well-being have been my constant motivation. They have taught me the importance of perseverance and the power of education to transform lives. They also taught me reasons of helping those who are in need . This is to have a self sustainable future generation.

More over , outside the classroom, I have immersed myself in a variety of extra-curricular activities. I am an active member of the school's environmental club, where we focus on sustainability projects and raising environmental awareness in our community. I'm also an anti drug ambassador and a dedicated youth advocate . I enjoy practising sign language and participating in charity activities. My passion for the arts is reflected in my participation in the debate club, where I have honed my skills in debating all negative activities and creative expression. I'm also an elite public speaker and a chess player. I have awards of quiz and more of academic activities.

All in all , sports have also played a significant role in my life. I am a member of the school's basketball team, and through this, I have learned the value of teamwork, discipline, and leadership. These experiences have not only enriched my life but have also allowed me to contribute positively in every activity. All this gave me confidence to develop and change the world . This is because at Moonrise I want granted a headboy post for the second time , so I now believe that nothing is impossible since I'm a good leader with standard leadership styles
