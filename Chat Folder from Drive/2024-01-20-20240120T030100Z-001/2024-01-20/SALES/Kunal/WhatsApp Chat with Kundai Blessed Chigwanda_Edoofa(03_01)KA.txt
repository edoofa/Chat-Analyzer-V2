This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

We have received the application of Kundai for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Kundai, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:
1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your understandings of the program as discussed with Leonor?
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay let me answer <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 047 7770: It is my pleasure that you gave me the opportunity to say it out the motivation on why l applies for the Edoofa scholarship program 

1)

So since as a child it has been my passion and dreams to study abroad whilst in the medical field. I have always been wanting to be a doctor but somehow due to career guidance that l managed to be involved in l realised that in the  medical field  there is no a doctor only,  rather there are many programs and jobs in  there , l appreciate my Uncle as one of my mentors who managed to encourage me and motivating me upto this level. The very moment my friend told me about your program l was happy amd by that time l told myself that finally my dream has come true and l believed in myself that l will secure a place there and she also told me on how you can assist one another with your organization 

From what l read in the document your sent me l felt like l really suit in with the qualifications you managed to list .l have heard about your access to quality education , the need for employability in higher education and your ability to provide educational opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the whole world. 

It was my pleasure when l heard that you offer these scholarships with the leading universities,  l really want to be studying in India as l heard of its quality education as well .

It is with my great honour to be part of the Edoofa scholarship program  together with the benefits your offer .I believe that working with you would help me in achieving my goals and passion with your organization.  As a child who have dreams to achieve more and being recognized as one of the top students  but without funds to make me that great somebody in the world is the main reason that motivated me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarships fund . 


I believe these are some of the motivations behind my application for the Edoofa scholarship program. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My understanding are as follows;

When l discussed with Leonora she highlighted to me that you offer a variety of programs at your program to both the under privileged and the deserving students across the whole globe. She also told me that you get the opportunity to the career guidance on what you want to do which is one of the best thing l admire. And supporting together other extracurricular programs together with mentorship .Leonora also told me that you offer opportunities to various branches and your students resulting in greater marketing access . She highlighted your assistance on how you apply for the scholarships process until you land in India
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: Your heartfelt expression of your dreams and aspirations is truly inspiring. It's evident that your passion for the medical field has been a driving force, and your journey reflects the valuable impact of mentorship from your uncle. The realization that the medical field offers a myriad of programs and career paths is a crucial insight gained through career guidance.

Your enthusiasm upon discovering the Edoofa scholarship program and its potential to make your dream of studying abroad a reality is genuinely uplifting. Your eagerness to secure a place and your belief in the alignment of your qualifications with the program's criteria are noteworthy.

Please discuss the same with your family and let me know once you are done
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay for sure 😊
05/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Good morning

05/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 047 7770: That is great

And as well the do agree on the scholarship rules 

But they also asked that after the graduation of the end of your program are you guaranteed to get a job , if so will l get the job in India , back in Zimbabwe or somewhere else ?

And on the Visa issue , if results come favourable we have to go to the Indian Embassy in Zimbabwe? 

What if the results come late,  so what is mainly your due dates ? So thay we know 

And then what if results come otherwise whilst you would have already offered my a place at the Edoofa scholarship program 

That's some of the questions l still recall
05/01/24, 4:13 pm - Kunal: Alright Kundai
Let me help you understand
05/01/24, 4:14 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that Edoofa doesn’t offer jobs directly to students as of now. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professional citizens of the era!
They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills. 

 Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally
05/01/24, 4:15 pm - Kunal: Yes, , if results come favourable you will have to go to the Indian Embassy in Zimbabwe and our Visa team will be guiding you in the hope process
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Please bear with me on the network issues 🙏🏻
05/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>

05/01/24, 5:48 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay okay l get it 

Thank you so much 🙏🏻
05/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Wow 
 thank you so much for the highlights
05/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay will be here at 10:00am

06/01/24, 10:54 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you

As per your understanding from the document, may I know what is the cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa? <This message was edited>
06/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 047 7770: From my understanding 
The cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa is 4000-5000 


Cost of education without Edoofa ($6000-$8000) subtracting cost reduced l pay  ($2000-$3000) =cost offered by Edoofa($4000-$5000)

Therefore the cost you pay as Edoofa program is $4000-$5000
And the cost that l pay is $2000-$3000 <This message was edited>
06/01/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: That is correct
So, have you discussed about the same with your family?
06/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 047 7770: Thank you 

Yes we discussed about it
06/01/24, 11:48 am - Kunal: May I know what their feedback was?
06/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 047 7770: They considered the program reasonable and very helpful since it helps in covering fees making it easy and very preferable to consider the program 

They really appreciated the affordability of the costs
06/01/24, 12:13 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
May I know if your uncle is part of this group?

06/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My main reason is an ambition to help people. A genuine sincerity to help others had been my main motivation in medical career. My dreams and passion for science had been a primary motivator in my career choice. Through visiting different hospitals and clinics had enhanced my interest in the medical fields together with the motivation from my family members .Admiring the way those doctors in laboratories work. My biggest dream is to treat a person whom many doctors would have given up on that person and to be recognized as one of them .

What inspired me to pursue a career in medical field is with the desire to help Others,th desire to serve others . As a medical scientist, you hold the power to make a profound impact on people's lives by easing pain and suffering, curing diseases, and improving their health and well-being therefore am ready to do that . There are some doctors that l admire the most despite that l have not yet seen them but l believe one day l will . The use of career guidance had given me enough motivation in what l want to be .One of the main reasons that enhanced me in pursuing in my career is the career guidance l receives from this girl by the name Charmaine Kahiya who is doing the Computational Pharmaceuticals under  Drug discovery .

I believe that the healthcare field is fast-paced and exciting.The medical field is exciting and ever-changing. Each day will present new information and challenges, keeping things interesting. New patients will require your expertise every day to day.

08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 047 7770: I don't have any past experience actually 

I am not yet learning anything in this field since l have just finished my Advanced level 

And on any of my  family working on it or studying currently 

There is noone 

However  there are some students who in our area who are currently doing it and motivating me and some 
People l just see on social media acing for that <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 10:46 am - Kunal: That is fine, Kundai

So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e form 5 or term and O level results, please?

08/01/24, 10:59 am - Kunal: May I know by when you are going to share?
08/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 047 7770: In 10 minutes time l am looking for them
08/01/24, 11:00 am - Kunal: That is fine
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 047 7770: Okay that is for sure 

Thank you so much 🙏🏻
I am confident about achieving it
08/01/24, 11:24 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
So, may I know your subjects of A level? <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 047 7770: Pure Mathematics 
Computer science 
And Biology
08/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 047 7770: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 047 7770: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 11:34 am - Kunal: May I know with your interests in the medical field, why didn't you opt for Physics and Chemistry at A level?
08/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 047 7770: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 047 7770: So when l was choosing a combination at Advanced level 

I firstly wanted Mathematics,  Biology and Chemistry  but they didn't offer me chemistry rather they offered me computer science, l tried to convince them but they could not accept it ,So l just danced to the tune and at that ,moment despite the fact that l was confused with what l would really do but through some career guidance l went to and some researches l found out that l can still be in the medical field but with limited programs .

And on physics, physics was never in my plans after finishing ordinary level
08/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
08/01/24, 11:58 am - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

08/01/24, 5:58 pm - Kunal: Please respond to this as well
08/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 78 047 7770: From my research as well as the knowledge you managed to give me 

I learnt that India offers a strong capability in contract manufacturing,  research and clinical trials . It offers quality education and research and Research and innovation opportunities.  My career aspirations are centered  around constant growth and skill enhancement. I am committed to staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry , the beneficial part of it is because you offer a faculty expertise and a very great area for for practical purposes, l even plam to attend industry conference to learn from experts. 

Studying in India implement a positive impact on my career in Biotechnology it's because India has a thriving biotechnology sector with many companies and research working in the fields.It provides opportunities for students like me to gain practical experience and make professional connections .The other positive impact is that the cost of lovinh and studying in India is much lower than manh other countries which means  that students can save money while they complete their studies.  Finally studying in India can give the students the chance to learn anoita the country's culture and customs which can be beneficial in a global career which is also highlighted on the point number 6 which says Cultural Diversity and vibrant campus life .
08/01/24, 6:26 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/01/24, 6:39 pm - +263 78 047 7770: If l recall as you mentioned before that is the average costs without any scholarship is $6000-$8000
08/01/24, 6:39 pm - Kunal: That is right
Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 6:39 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 6:39 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
08/01/24, 6:55 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay thank you so much for the highlights
08/01/24, 6:58 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay thank you so much 

So this means that the first semester its 2000-$3000 and then the second 

Or then $2000-$3000 is just paid at the beginning for the rest of the year   ?


I really appreciate the affordability of the country India together with your help of Edoofa to make high quality of education cheaper
08/01/24, 7:00 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Yes it is affordable for my family , l believe 

And l can see the work of your scholarships as well as the Earn While You Learn program
08/01/24, 7:05 pm - Kunal: *This cost is paid in two equal installments.Each installment is paid before a semester.There are two semesters in a year*
08/01/24, 7:08 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay 

But is the cost for each semester $2000-$3000  or the $2000-$3000 covers for both the semesters?

Can you educate me more on that one
08/01/24, 7:09 pm - Kunal: It is for each semester, ($2000-$3000) per annum including the remaining tuition fee, food, accommodation, and basic necessities such as Wifi, Laundry, Library fee, etc.
08/01/24, 7:10 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Meaning to say the total amount needed for a year is about $4000-$6000  since you said for semester?

Sorry for me not understanding

The annual cost for this program is $2000-$3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and basic necessities like Wifi, Laundry, Library fee, etc. This amount is divided into two equal installments, each paid before a semester, and there are two semesters in a year.
08/01/24, 7:14 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay thank you so so much 

I was a bit confused 

Thank you for the explanation .
08/01/24, 7:20 pm - Kunal: That is fine
08/01/24, 7:20 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 7:20 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

08/01/24, 7:26 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay

I understood 

Thank you so much for the information
08/01/24, 7:28 pm - +263 78 047 7770: That is very great working with Brands and companies 
It is good indeed
08/01/24, 7:29 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?

08/01/24, 7:36 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My views on this includes the following:
You will be taught so much during your course , you are being taught in several ways by different experts , you are taught on how to build confidence especially in the Digitalization of industries, taught on how to network, the main view is that they help you reduce your expenses together with your tuition fees which becomes very cheaper for us , you benefit a lot from the EWYL program .


Yes, l will be benefitting from the Earn While You Learn program
08/01/24, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

19/01/24, 9:57 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
