09/01/24, 9:23 pm - +263 78 131 1116: what inspired me to go through with this is that it is affordable. It offers 50-100% scholarship depending on the likes of grades etc. 
As per discussions with Wesley the program is quite nice. I heard there's this other program which about Earn While You Learn which gives one the opportunity to earn money per month throughout the course. This helps one to complete their education at less the price.

19/01/24, 9:56 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
