 I learned that Edoofa scholarship program caters  for those students who want to proceed with their tertiary education in lndia. Students  also get to engage in projects that are aimed at. career and skill development through Earn While You learn program .



I want to be accepted into the Edoofa program because it has a lot of beneficiaries. One can engage in projects that are aimed at career and skill development along with Earn While You learn program. lt has been my dream since childhood to study in lndia because l'm fond of those Indian movies and their festivals.  ln so doing in trying to pursue my tertiary education l will be fulfilling my dream.

13/01/24, 9:16 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
19/01/24, 9:59 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone
We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.

We are putting a formal closure to your application. Feel free to re-apply when you are ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
