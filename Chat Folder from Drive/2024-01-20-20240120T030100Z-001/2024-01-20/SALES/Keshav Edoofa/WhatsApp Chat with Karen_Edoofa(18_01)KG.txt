18/01/24, 1:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Karen and Mr. Simon!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Shantelle.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Yes I'm Karen
18/01/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Karen,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Karen, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Shantelle, is that correct?
18/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
18/01/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Shantelle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Shantelle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 383 1195: The purpose of the Edoofa scholarships is to provide support and resources to individuals who may face barriers to entering the financial services industry. These scholarships are designed to help level the playing field for individuals who come from diverse backgrounds, and to encourage them to pursue careers in finance. By providing financial support and mentorship opportunities, the edoofa scholarships aim to help individuals achieve their career goals .
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very well Karen, now let further elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

18/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay I was in a lesson at school
19/01/24, 8:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Karen and Mr. Simon, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
19/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
19/01/24, 8:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Karen
19/01/24, 8:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 8:48 am - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
19/01/24, 8:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Karen, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
