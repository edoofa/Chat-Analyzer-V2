16/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 826 9582: It is a scholarship program program providing me an opportunity to fulfill my dreams interms of higher education
16/01/24, 11:07 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That is true Roy, you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 71 826 9582: Ohhh okay okay thank you
16/01/24, 11:11 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/01/24, 11:11 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
16/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 71 826 9582: Already liked the Earn while you learn program
16/01/24, 11:11 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 71 826 9582: Ohh okay and i have applied but don’t know wich university
16/01/24, 11:13 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I would be helping you regarding the same Roy, meanwhile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 826 9582: Okay okay
16/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 826 9582: Yes I believe so but as for my parents they’re currently busy with work they will be free at night so their participation is not guaranteed
16/01/24, 12:24 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Roy, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?

18/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 826 9582: What if i got the scholarship will i be assisted with transport and the documentations like VISA and passport
18/01/24, 3:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: All these doubts will be clarified in due time Roy as we proceed ahead with the Counseling session
18/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohhh okay okay thank you
18/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay I’m waiting
18/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/01/24, 3:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/01/24, 3:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 3:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohhh okay okay thank you how about if someone is not able to get that tuition of $2000-$3000
18/01/24, 3:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Roy, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program which is the solution for your concern Roy!!
18/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohhh okay okay now i get so roughly it will reduce from $3000to how much?If one is doing the earn while you learn programm
18/01/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It will get clarified when I explain about EWYL program to you
18/01/24, 3:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
18/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohh okay i get it thank you
18/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 826 9582: How about if i want to change my program and take something that is in the business sector for example auditing and risk management?
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

19/01/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Go through the information carefully this time Roy and do tell me when you understand the course completely
19/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay okay thank you I think it’s best if i take Bachelor of Arts in Geography
19/01/24, 2:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Roy, is it confirm then we should proceed ahead with BA Geography as your course?
19/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yes that’s my confirmation let’s proceed with BA Geography
19/01/24, 2:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As I was explaining about the EWYL program to you let me add further to it,

Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohhh okay okay i getting my parents would like this
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
19/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yeah sure
19/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 826 9582: I have now realized that you’re different for sure,yes have been looking for it and it will release pressure upon my parents in terms of investing in me
19/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to know the same Roy!
19/01/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay
19/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yes im ready
19/01/24, 2:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Roy as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 826 9582: $1500-$2250
19/01/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Roy, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohh okay and be able to apply to five universities or you’ll help him or her?
19/01/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ohh okay okay
19/01/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Roy!
19/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 826 9582: I think it’s good
19/01/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
19/01/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Roy, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay
19/01/24, 3:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you have gone through the payment policy as well Roy?
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yea i did
19/01/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Roy, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
19/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yes I do understand so after paying this what’s next
19/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 826 9582: ?
19/01/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain you about this now!
19/01/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Yeah sure
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Roy, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
19/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/01/24, 3:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available @263718269582 ?
19/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Ok I did
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/01/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay okay I understand the above
19/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 826 9582: Okay okay so how much should-be payed for the first installment
19/01/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
I hope Mrs. Snodia and Mr. Joshua @263772440929 @263773264066 you followed the session as well?

If you want to clarify anything about the process kindly do tell me
19/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This will depend on the scholarship amount and your university but the registration fee ranges from 500-1000$ but as you know this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and will be adjusted
19/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Further regarding this all will be clarified very well after your eligibility check stage!
19/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is there anything else to ask Roy?
