18/01/24, 12:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Trish!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Tatenda.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Thank you so much Mr Keshav for your response. I'm happy to discuss my application with you and answer any questions you may have
18/01/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Trish,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Okay
18/01/24, 1:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Trish, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes
18/01/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Tatenda  told me that he is a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. He have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

After realising this thats when he  started looking for scholarship and he was found  eligible  with Edoofa scholarship program.
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great to know about your understanding but let me further elaborate!
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
18/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 031 1610: I'm very impressed by the Edoofa Scholarship Program and its focus on skill development through real-time projects. It's wonderful to see an organization like Edoofa that is so committed to improving the quality of education and providing students with employability skills. I'm very interested in learning more about the program and the ways that it is impacting students and their future careers.
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Trish!
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Tatenda also gave me this insight about Edoofa, and l understand now that it is a scholarship program initiated by  Anhad Edutrain Solutions. INDIA ...Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.
18/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Trish, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing clarity i must say Trish, Kudos!
18/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes I do
18/01/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sorry for the delay, I was a bit occupied 
shall we continue?
18/01/24, 3:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Trish!
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes we can
18/01/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Trish, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
18/01/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Sorry for the delay ,I'll reply you soon
18/01/24, 4:44 pm - +263 78 031 1610: I'm excited to be a part of the Edoofa student community! I'd be happy to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm from Zimbabwe, and I've done A level  and want to persue an Accounting degree. Accounting is fascinating to me because it's like a puzzle that needs to be solved. I enjoy the challenge of putting together the pieces of financial information to create a complete picture. I also enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing a complex project and seeing the results of my work. I'm also interested in the way that accounting can help businesses and organizations run more efficiently and make better decisions. For me, it's not just about numbers; it's about helping people and businesses succeed.My interest in accounting combines with my attention to detail, which allows me to spot discrepancies in financial statements and make sure that all of the numbers add up. I find it very rewarding to find those little mistakes and fix them before they become big problems. I live with both my parents and am their first born ,we're three children in my family, and my parents work in  two different fields . My mom is teacher,a primary teacher and my dad is a Salesman at a Beverage company
18/01/24, 4:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Trish, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead.

19/01/24, 9:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
19/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 031 1610: My parents were able to help me financially through my studies up to form 4, but  due to work problems at my A level, they could not afford my fees so they got me registered for the BEAM program, and I am interested in pursuing higher education abroad. Even my parents want the same thing but they want to get to know the fees you offer and if they will be able to afford
19/01/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile I understand the challenges Trish let me assure you as your counselor, I am here to help you and guide you with utmost efforts for you to secure maximum scholarship under our Edoofa program, <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 031 1610: I  believe that accounting is a stable and reliable career path, and I am excited to learn more about the field and become a skilled Chartered accountant

I am motivated by the idea of having a career that is both stable and rewarding, and I believe that I have the determination and dedication to succeed in this field.
19/01/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 031 1610: I believe that studying abroad will give me a unique and valuable experience that I can't get by staying in my home country. I'm looking forward to expanding my horizons and gaining new perspectives that will help me grow as a person and as a professional.
19/01/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

19/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Yes Sir ,am available for now  you may continue
19/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
19/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 031 1610: Nothing for now ,but am sure my parents will have questions but for now they're busy at work . As soon as they're free ,they'll join us
19/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Trish let them know the details we have covered so far and you can ask me their doubts and clarifications on their behalf
19/01/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
