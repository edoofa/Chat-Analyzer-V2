15/01/24, 2:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me start by briefing you about Edoofa scholarship program
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *With immense pleasure,let me share glimpses of our Africa Visit of May- June 2023 where our Founders were welcomed by Educationists, Edoofians and parents from different African Nations, especially in Zimbabwe. You can go through our Global Education Summit hosted at Dominican Convent School, Harare on 28th May and at UCE, Bulawayo on the 2nd of June*
15/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Yeah Im ready now
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 564 9272: Thank you it's awesome
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/01/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Yah I can

18/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 265 4849: I love India so it's a dream come true and it's economy is better than ours and internal opportunities can open
18/01/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Chamaine

Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
18/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Yah I remember the techniques it used like growing genetically modified crops green house farming as well
18/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will elaborate this aspect for you Chamaine
18/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Ok
18/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

18/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could resonate with the information and understand it
18/01/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
18/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 265 4849: No questions
18/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then Chamaine, 
Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Okay yah it's better than other western countries
18/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Chamaine rightly comprehended!
18/01/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Chamaine what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Oky I understand
18/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 265 4849: So can l persue my tertiary education abroad when l don't have o level mathematics
18/01/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything? Also I hope @263775649272 Mrs. Munemo you are following up with the same?
Or now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
18/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Yah you can
18/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Absolutely you can pursue Chamaine, pursuing BBA here in India wont be requiring having mathematics at O or A level
18/01/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
18/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Oh thanks what a relief
18/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Sure it's nice t
18/01/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/01/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/01/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

18/01/24, 4:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Chamaine, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Oh I see
18/01/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/01/24, 4:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/01/24, 4:29 pm - +263 78 265 4849: I realized it though
18/01/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well Chamaine, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 8:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Chamaine and Mrs. Munemo  , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
19/01/24, 8:58 am - +263 78 265 4849: Morning yeah we can
19/01/24, 9:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Chamaine, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
19/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 265 4849: Yah I spoke to them
19/01/24, 9:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: What did you all discuss with them?

I hope you told them everything we discussed so far and how Edoofa will provide you an opportunity to secure maximum scholarship for your higher education abroad!
19/01/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 265 4849: Yah l send crucial points in the family grou
19/01/24, 9:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then Chamaine, you can ask me the doubts on their behalf too
19/01/24, 9:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 265 4849: Sorry for the inconvenience Im back now was quite back now
19/01/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: So Chamaine, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 265 4849: 1500 to 2250
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Chamaine, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 265 4849: Wow better thanks
19/01/24, 11:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 265 4849: Sure it's really good and makes the whole process affordable
19/01/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/01/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
19/01/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Chamaine, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 78 265 4849: Okay
19/01/24, 11:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Chamaine, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
19/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 265 4849: I understand that yesterday bt can that be done here in zim or it's in India only
19/01/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Your preferred year of admission is August 2024? 
Am I right?
19/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 265 4849: No next yr
19/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Chamaine
19/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain you in a few minutes about this as we go through the session ahead
19/01/24, 11:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
19/01/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Chamaine, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
19/01/24, 11:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
19/01/24, 11:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
19/01/24, 1:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available to continue the session @263782654849? <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 265 4849: Yah I understand now yah she is better now

19/01/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
19/01/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
