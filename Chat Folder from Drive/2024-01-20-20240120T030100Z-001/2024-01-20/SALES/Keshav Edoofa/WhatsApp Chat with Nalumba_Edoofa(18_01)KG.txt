You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 12:46 pm - +260 97 2580246: What is this?
18/01/24, 12:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. James I hope you are doing well
18/01/24, 12:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Nalumba, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Faith, is that correct?
18/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 779950273: yes
18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Faith, also do tell me whether you learnt about Faith’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 1:23 pm - +260 779950273: OK
18/01/24, 1:24 pm - +260 779950273: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very Well Nalumba, now let me further elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you
18/01/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

18/01/24, 1:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 779950273: OK thank you very much for the opportunity
18/01/24, 1:37 pm - +260 779950273: so do we get projects to do
18/01/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: All of it will be conveyed to you Nalumba as we proceed ahead with the counseling session
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 779950273: OK
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 779950273: on my honest opinion I think it's possible
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Nalumba!
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Nalumba, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
