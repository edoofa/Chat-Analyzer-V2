You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
16/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay ma'am thank you one again
16/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn?
16/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 737 4326: What l under stand about it is that it is a hundred percent scholarship in India where it helps students world wide and l learnt that it is a good program that helps us reach out destination
16/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 737 4326: Wow this is amazing
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So may I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship?
16/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 737 4326: Hundred percent scholarship is when the Edoofa will be paying all your bills including tuition fee and department fee l think that's all
16/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Received
16/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
16/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay now l get it
16/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That's good
16/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yes
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Gumbonzvanda high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay at Gumbonzvanda high school we used to pay 300 USD per term then 90 USD for extra lessons ,l wish to study civil engineering or to be an environmental health technician 
My strengths is in studying mostly and praying and l love chatting with different people basically am a free person and a simple one
My weakness is l cry shortly when am hurt even with a small thing

16/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: May I know about the final support?
16/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to your mother itself.
16/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay wait for her she will reply soon
16/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

However did you discuss regarding the application with your mother earlier?
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes l did
16/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

16/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from you Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind such delayed responses, Tadiwanashe?
16/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 737 4326: My phone was off there was no electricity am sorry
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 737 4326: O level its 7 subjects 
A level 7 points Crop science B,Economics E and Business studies D
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
16/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Civil Engineering?
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Jus want to be in engineering industry and constructing roads
16/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: While that's great,

May I know what all did you research regarding the requirements of Engineering, Tadiwanashe?
16/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
16/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
16/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Civil engineering is the study of designing, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure such as buildings, roads, bridges, dams, and other large-scale construction projects. It involves the application of scientific and mathematical principles to solve problems related to the built environment. Civil engineers also work to ensure that these structures are safe, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. They may also be involved in urban planning, environmental engineering, and transportation systems.
16/01/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct,

However I am referring to the requirements of Civil Engineering.

That is the subjects required.
16/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 77 737 4326: It needs science subjects
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Physics and mathematics are a mandatory requirement.
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Why didn't you pursue the same in your A level?
16/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Hmmm l couldn't pursue them because l  wasn't that good at sciences
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
16/01/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement for Engineering in Zimbabwe too, Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay
16/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Meaning to say l can't do engineering without these two
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Unfortunately you cannot either in India or Zimbabwe, Tadiwanashe.
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 737 4326: So is there any other course that l would do
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: May I know why you chose this subject combination, Tadiwanashe!
16/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we will discuss!
16/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Sure
16/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 77 963 6509: But in Zimbabwe one can do at polytechnical colleges
16/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement for Engineering, Mrs Tapiwa.
16/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 737 4326: From my point of view l see it as easy subjects to do
16/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 963 6509: What about Safety health and  Environmental management course ,do u offer it
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

So which other fields are you inclined towards, Tadiwanashe?

As per your results I believe Bachelors in Business administration would be a great choice for you!
16/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I will surely regarding that too!
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Polytechnic college would provide you with diploma level of education, Mrs Tapiwa, isn't it?
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Something related to environment not business
16/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Yes
16/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 77 963 6509: Then 2years BTech at university
16/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tapiwa, that was a question for Tadiwanashe concerning her interests and results itself.
16/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I will brief you about Environmental studies.
16/01/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 737 4326: I want something related to environment not business
16/01/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: That has been noted, Tadiwanashe.

However I can see you have inclination towards science subjects.

The same being the reason I questioned as to why you didn't pursue sciences in A level.

However, now let me assist you with Environmental studies.
16/01/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

16/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay noted
16/01/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me?
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - +263 77 737 4326: No l don't have
16/01/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.

As of now, shall I brief you about Bachelors in Geography?

19/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 737 4326: So now may you please help me on how to choose the best course
19/01/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Let me provide you with a clarity on how Geography is best related with Agriculture.
19/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.
19/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 737 4326: Okay okay
19/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have a better clarity?
19/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yeh l think it will be better if l take Agricultural right
19/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: You donot qualify for Agriculture based on your subjects please.
19/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Like we were discussing earlier, Bachelor in Geography would cater for your interests.
19/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay so that will be okay right
19/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 737 4326: Thank you l will do Bachelor in Geography

19/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: As we discussing now.
19/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: And earlier, as to how Bachelor in Geography is related to your interests.
19/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yeh
19/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yeh received
19/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Alright Tadiwanashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 737 4326: In the next five years once l finish my degree l see a great woman working for her family and helping others to achieve my goals and others too
19/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: That is great Tadiwanashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 737 4326: The thing is l always dream big and l always see a better future and achieving my goals by studying outside my country
19/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwanashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
19/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 737 4326: Yes here in things are hard but as for me l always wish to study abroad one day it will change we are the adults of tomorrow we can lift others after we achieved our goals
19/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: It's great to know of your thoughts, Tadiwanashe.
19/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future too!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
19/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 737 4326: Thank you ma'am
19/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 737 4326: I do have my former classmates they are studying there one is at Parul University she said India is really a good country when it comes to education they offer higher education and they are friendly too they don't discriminate people they jus took u on how you are and l liked that
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 737 4326: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 737 4326: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have first hand knowledge about India from your friends, Tadiwanashe.

However did you ever happen to research about Parul University?
19/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Received please
19/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 737 4326: I never researched about it my friend is the one who told me about it and it did send a message to my phone let me copy and foward it
19/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
19/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 737 4326: *Parul University!!!🎓*

*Choose More, Choose Right!!*
19/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: It is quite unfortunate to hear about that, since Edoofa is associated with some of the finest and the most resourceful universities in India, we are partnered up with more than 250+ Universities in India but we are not associated with Parul University because of a reason.
19/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: The reason being Parul University isn't ranked under NIRF and the degrees offered by them are not recognized on a global level, it is because the founders are accused of rape. 

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. 

For your reference, I am sharing the link to the news with you so that you can check the same for yourself.

19/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay l do understand now
19/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Did any of your friend ever try to get their degrees validated?
19/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Ooh okay thank you so much l now understand the reason

19/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared images as well, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Downloading
19/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Wow this is really amazing
19/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
19/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes am still going through them
19/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tadiwanashe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
19/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 737 4326: No we not
19/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 737 4326: No we not
19/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay noted
19/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
19/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 737 4326: This is good but my mom will not be able to pay 2000usd per year
19/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, Tadiwanashe.

Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

What is your take on the same?
19/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 737 4326: That's true
19/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 737 4326: May u please ask my mom if she is able to do it
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: So given that costs are even higher in Zimbabwe, and you don't have any Earn While You Learn Program too.

What is your financial planning for your higher education, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You can definitely discuss with her.
19/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Right now we have little money we won't be able to meet the requirements
19/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: I understand, Tadiwanashe!

However I am discussing with you regarding the costs even in Zimbabwe
19/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes l do get it but what can we do if we are not be able to afford the 2000
19/01/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I believe you understand that higher education would require such financial support in Zimbabwe or in India, Tadiwanashe?

Who has been supporting you with your school fee?
19/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 737 4326: My mum
19/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: I believe just your school tuition fee adds upto $1200 a year, isn't it, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: While expenses like transport and food, other basic requirements are there too?
19/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yes that is true
19/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: So may I know more about the same?

Considering you would anyone have to spend $3000 in Zimbabwe for quality education, Tadiwanashe.

In India, the costs are $2000-3000 inclusive of Tuition fee, Accomodation, Food and Basic University Expenses like Gym, Wifi, Laundry, Library!
19/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same you also have an opportunity to work in the Earn While You Learn Program.
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Yeh l gut it now thank u
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Will come back to u once l talk to my mum
19/01/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Sure, Tadiwanashe!
19/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Regarding the Earn While You Learn Program, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 963 6509: How do you go about an Earn While you learn programme
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay
19/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries?

@263777374326 @263779636509
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 77 963 6509: No
19/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright!

Mrs Tapiwa what is your take on the costs offered and affordability please?
19/01/24, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
19/01/24, 5:44 pm - +263 77 737 4326: Okay thank you
