21/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I have read through
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
21/11/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Portia, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Tinashe better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
21/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Mr Tinashe and I are married and we have been taking care of our kids through the income that we get from our small business. Our aspirations for our kids is for them to have an opportunity to  fulfill their dreams and passion. Hence as parents we try to give them the best of education by supporting them financially  and emotionally. 
We believe our children comes first in terms of priority as such we strive to give them the best.
21/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 168 2406: In terms of qualifications,  I am a holder of a Bachelor of Accountancy degree. I also have a Postgraduate diploma in Education
21/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 168 2406: My motivation comes from the fact that education liberates people.  Thus I  want our children to be liberated from poverty through education
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I would love it if my children were to achieve the highest qualifications possible and for them to be able to contribute immensely for the betterment  of the world
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mrs Portia, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

Your thoughts on importance of education are admirable.
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Thank you
21/11/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

So I would like to know Adonis better as a student, how he is at school, his interests and hobbies along with anything that you would like to share about her?
21/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Adonis is someone who is hard working and strives for perfection. He is an A class student who is self driven and we'll disciplined. He's dream has always been to be a software engineer due to his love fir computers. He used to enjoy watching documentaries on planes. Most of his time he spends reading books and researching on his school work. As a mother I am proud of him as he has never disappointed me in all of his endeavors
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 168 2406: As the first born he has a sense of responsibility towards his siblings hence he always try to set a good example for them by always doing what is good
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Very well expressed Mrs Portia! 

It's a pleasure to know more about him and his fondness for Computers too!
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I am really confident that he will get all 15 points.  He won't disappoint
21/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing!
21/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Can you please confirm his A level subject combination with me Mrs Portia?
21/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Mathematics

21/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay

21/11/23, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please.
21/11/23, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Portia, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
21/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Questions do arise as to whether India will be able to give Adonis the exposure and expertise he is looking for  and whether he will have an opportunity to experience the best  education available
21/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity regarding the same.
21/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

Let me also show you some facts about India and several global leaders who are Indian graduates.
21/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 168 2406: However when we were introduced to this program I was able to note that the program offers an advantage to the children since it allows them to have on the job training whilst they are also studying

21/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
21/11/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared resources and inform me once done please.
21/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Woow India really is the best. It's full of potential
21/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I have gone through them and I am impressed with the achievements of people from India. I think India will be able to give Adonis the best opportunity  in his studies
21/11/23, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Portia!

I appreciate your thorough participation.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 168 2406: No I haven't looked into the cost as of yet
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I understand
21/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Portia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 168 2406: It's good the tuition is affordable and since it can be further reduced through earn while you learn program I think its really fair
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Mrs Portia!

Let me brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you as well as Adonis.
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/11/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/11/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay I understand
21/11/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
21/11/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay that's really good
21/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 168 2406: It will be affordable
21/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes I have realized the difference and how much this program really helps our children
21/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: That is great, you see students begin with their Earn While You Learn Journey while they are still in Zimbabwe which help them earn credits before coming to India!
21/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Portia now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would conclude in about 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Really  how do they do that
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes I am ready
21/11/23, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: Adonis, would be alloted a dedicated mentor once he is accepted into the program who would assist him throughout his journey and help him be a wonderful part of the program!
21/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Portia, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 168 2406: $1500-$2250
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Portia, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I see your point.
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay I understand
21/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: It's great to have you thoroughly following.
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes this is understandable
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/11/23, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes well understood
21/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
21/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Okay
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.

22/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 168 2406: It went well. I understood the program
22/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you know 12 students already have reserved the scholarship seat from Daramombe High for their higher education through the Edoofa Program. 

1. Rufaro Princess Musarurwa

3. Kimberly Hunda
4. Tadiwanashe Walter Nyika

22/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 168 2406: 1. Software Engineering 
2. India 
3. 8000USD
4. $2000-$3000
5. $350
6. 7 days
7. Yes
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
22/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th November 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 168 2406: It's okay I will pay the enrollment fee as I want my child to have the best education in the world
22/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I understand we are fully prepared for this program
22/11/23, 6:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Number 2
22/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we are prepared

Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!

I have been so happy, as well excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽. 

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
23/11/23, 9:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 11:38 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Thank you very much.  I am truly grateful for all your help. I will acknowledge them via email. Thank you once again for your assistance

24/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 168 2406: Good morning
24/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 168 2406: Are we still connecting at 11 AM
24/11/23, 12:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I am well thank you
24/11/23, 12:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the student's acceptance letter and did you manage to discuss it as a family ?
24/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did
24/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
24/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 168 2406: I have understood it all will make the payment this coming Monday or Tuesday
24/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
24/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
