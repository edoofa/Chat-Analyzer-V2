Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
05/01/24, 10:35 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Here
05/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I am aware of the same please,

I am referring to your understanding of the sponsoring part.
05/01/24, 10:37 am - +265 989 91 19 12: The scholarship
05/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Alice, kindly follow the question properly please.

You mentioned scholarship as fully funded in part one.

May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship please?
05/01/24, 10:50 am - +265 989 91 19 12: A fully funded scholarship covers all the expenses associated with your education, including tuition, living expenses, and sometimes even travel costs.
05/01/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/01/24, 10:52 am - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand that now thank you for the clarification
05/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
05/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Alice, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your previous/current institute charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/01/24, 10:56 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright
05/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
05/01/24, 11:09 am - +265 989 91 19 12: My name is Alice Phiri and I am turning 21 years in August. I have two younger sisters and I am the first born. I used to learn at Hope Fountain Combined school and I graduated there in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree. The fees was R1200which is around $55 per month. I am currently studying Social Work at the University of Lilongwe and I will be finishing my first year in July. The fees is currently Mk425000 per semester . My strengths are in Essay writing and my weaknesses are in Mathematics and Accounting. I recently started playing basketball and I am yet to join the students welfare committee and Entertainment team. 

My father is a well educated man and is working in South Africa as a Fitter and turner.  My mother is unemployed and she is in Malawi in a village called kukathenthere near Matete. My little Sister Ayanda is in Grade11 in South Africa and the last born is two years and stays with my mother. <This message was edited>

06/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: All the students Alice.

Let me share a document for a better understanding regarding the program.
06/01/24, 11:58 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
06/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 12:04 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand.  I've seen Sibo do some videos online
06/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: It's a 21 page long document, do take out time to thoroughly read the document.
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: It means the more she does those projects...the more her fees decreases?
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I will do exactly that
06/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
06/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: And is it possible for me to get employment there without me having to come back to Malawi
06/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
06/01/24, 3:36 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: That's very convincing
06/01/24, 3:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: And Sibo told me that her school helps her renew her visa...if I get the scholarship will we be in the same school?
06/01/24, 3:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm just waiting to hear from my father. He's at work.
06/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Every student and application is different,

You receive your acceptance letters as per your application and evaluation.
06/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Kindly have a thorough discussion, meanwhile the discussion is scheduled for Monday at 9:30 AM CAT.

08/01/24, 11:53 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Good morning
08/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: How are you?
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm good n uu
08/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Sorry for being late there's no power and all our phones were off
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: I understand
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Were you able to thoroughly discuss everything with your parents as a family?
08/01/24, 12:07 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thanks for that
08/01/24, 12:08 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Not as much. The last time I spoke to my dad he encouraged me to participate so I Haven't spoken to him the whole weekend. He's at work right now and he can't answer
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Haven't you been able to discuss since Saturday?
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes. My phone was off
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm charging now
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: I understand 

I await your response, do thoroughly discuss with your parents!
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you ma'am
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I will give you feedback as soon as possible
08/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Can I ask one question again
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Is the fees payable in quarters
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me assist you with the same.
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Alice, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/01/24, 12:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I didn't know that you also provide meals for the students
08/01/24, 12:38 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: That's incredible
08/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: The cost after the scholarship includes Tuition fee, Accomodation and food
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright then
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: I hope you were able to go through the shared document?
08/01/24, 12:57 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I did
08/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: 1.The edoofa program was established to help students with a scholarship to inhance employability for students from Africa . It offers a very structured and practical training to selected  students to increase their work experience.
 
2. The financial aspect of the program entails that students are offered a 50% scholarship (at times a 100%scholarship) and after the scholarship has been given...the learner has to pay for accommodation ,fees and food(depending wether they stay on campus or off campus )
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Duly received,

I believe you understood the following too?
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 1:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: What are the basic university expenses
08/01/24, 1:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I understood
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I have chosen the $1500-$2000
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Basic university expenses like Library, Gym, Laundry, Wifi.
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
08/01/24, 1:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I meant 1500-3000
08/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the same, Alice?
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I did ma'am
08/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you with $1500-2000 a year, Alice?
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: They are
08/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Did you discuss with your parents too, Alice?
08/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/01/24, 8:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes i did
08/01/24, 8:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: They both agreed
08/01/24, 8:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm not sure I will be available since I'm on 12% and there is still no power here
08/01/24, 8:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: But I will try to charge my phone
08/01/24, 11:26 pm - Harmehak: You can request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note.

09/01/24, 10:39 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes

09/01/24, 11:28 am - +27 68 038 1022: Good morning. Sorry for the late response. I'm Alice's father and I do follow the discussion in my spare time. I think Alice has the final decision and us as parents are there to support her. Wish her all the best  in her studies abroad. I personally promise to support her financially as I have done previously. Thanks you.
09/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Phiri.

I do appreciate your support and acknowledgement.
09/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Alice, I can see in your application, you also opted for Business Administration, isn't it?
09/01/24, 1:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes but my passion is in Social work . I want to help people
09/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

So can you please elaborate regarding your desire to pursue social work and what other things motivates you to work in the this field?
09/01/24, 1:26 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: The country that I'm from (Malawi) has a poor community development program.  My dream is to have degrees in social work,psychology and community development so I can make an impact on disadvantaged children. I feel like I can help children in villages with the smallest things such as pens and pencils (because children lack motivation when they don't have pens pencils or even uniform ). My NGO also aims at decreasing teenage pregnancy and promoting a better and brighter future.  My uncle has a program where he goes door to door in our village and educate families on the advantages of family planning
09/01/24, 1:27 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Sorry I have a lot to say about how I want to change the world for the better.
09/01/24, 1:27 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: It's not only through politics that our countries can change but through the smallest acts of human kindness.
09/01/24, 1:30 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Studying abroad is a much better advantage for me and my family
09/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: I can see that is something really close to your heart and I appreciate the thought you have put behind the same.

It's great to know of your kind acts, Alice.

Given the right resources and education, I believe you shall surely do wonders!
09/01/24, 1:39 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you
09/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Kindly share your grade 12 results for evaluation, Alice
09/01/24, 1:41 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 1:41 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: <Media omitted>

09/01/24, 1:41 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Received please,

Let me brief you regarding your desired course.
09/01/24, 2:45 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: This message was deleted
09/01/24, 2:46 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes please
09/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
09/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
09/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
09/01/24, 2:55 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I have done one module called sociology in my first semester
09/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
09/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: What is your understanding of the brief I shared with you, Alice.
09/01/24, 3:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Sociology is the study of society, human social behavior, and the underlying patterns that shape interactions among individuals and groups.
09/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So far are you clear with the similarities between Sociology and Social work.
09/01/24, 3:32 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I have
09/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology?
09/01/24, 3:51 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: There's no bachelor of social work?
09/01/24, 3:51 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes

09/01/24, 4:10 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Not at all
09/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue Bachelors in Sociology, Alice?
09/01/24, 4:17 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
It is indeed similar but I would really want my certificate to be written Bachelor's Degree in Social work. It's in my dream board

09/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: I do understand your aspirations, Alice.

However your course is Bachelor in Sociology.

It would cater for the same interests as that of Social work.

10/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Now, do you have any queries for me?
10/01/24, 11:15 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Not at all
10/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Would you like to proceed ahead with BA Honors in Sociology in that case?
10/01/24, 11:16 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I would
10/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Alright so Alice, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
10/01/24, 11:20 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Helping people is my main goal. I want to see myself in a place where people have basic needs and wants. It is important for me to find a way for children to not leave school and for parents to know the importance of family planning as it reduces poverty. With this course I hope to start my NGOs all around the world to help the disadvantaged
10/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: That is really great Alice, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

I thoroughly appreciate your noble thoughts.

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/01/24, 11:27 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Chances of getting employment in my country are slim. There is a lot of corruption and nepotism. It scares me a lot to think of me graduating college and not getting employment <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 11:27 am - +265 989 91 19 12: I do want to work while I have my NGOs
10/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I completely understand the situation as the founders happened to visit Malawi and they shared their experiences.
10/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: However I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Alice.
10/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination, Alice.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
10/01/24, 11:37 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Mind sharing with me their experiences
10/01/24, 11:39 am - +265 989 91 19 12: It is said that the Edoofa Education System can sponsor your education to greater heights. This means that I can be one of the students that get to stay and work in India or they can take me to a country of my choice. My dear friend emphasized on the opportunities I have abroad than in my local country
10/01/24, 11:40 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Research states that Education in India is organic, as it keeps growing and evolves with time and the human mind too. So, This is the major reason why education provided in different nations of the world is different actually.
10/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I am glad Sibonginkhosi assisted you with that.
10/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: That's very correct
10/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

10/01/24, 11:47 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Wonderful
10/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Alice.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
10/01/24, 11:48 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Not really
10/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Alright please
10/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 11:59 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted with an understanding
10/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

I believe you must recall when we discussed this earlier as well?
10/01/24, 12:00 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I recall it very well
10/01/24, 12:02 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand this
10/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
10/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
10/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
10/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

10/01/24, 12:12 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: The EWYL Program can reduce the fees from $2000  to$1000 in a period of how long?
10/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/01/24, 12:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand
10/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries?
10/01/24, 12:26 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Not at all
10/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:49 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: This is amazing
10/01/24, 12:49 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: But does not affect the learners school work?
10/01/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: No please, as you would be alloted a dedicated mentor who will assist you with your projects and schedule.
10/01/24, 12:54 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright noted
10/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
10/01/24, 1:16 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm ready
10/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Alice, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
10/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/01/24, 1:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: More money will be spent
10/01/24, 1:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: 450 × 5 =2250
10/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/01/24, 1:42 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
10/01/24, 1:43 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: This is the due date?
10/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: You pay after being found eligible.

I will brief you about the due date.

Fee is for those found eligible in this round.
10/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/01/24, 1:45 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: This is a better approach
10/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/01/24, 1:49 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/01/24, 2:02 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand everything
10/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
10/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
10/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:14 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: The registration is paid once off?
10/01/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: It's not a separate fee for our Proud Edoofians.

It's waived off from their first year's tuition fee, so you pay nothing extra.

Unlike for students who apply by themselves, they pay separate registration fee.
10/01/24, 2:16 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay...I understand
10/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Dancila.vcf (file attached)
10/01/24, 2:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you
10/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Dancila too
10/01/24, 2:20 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Will do
10/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything?
10/01/24, 2:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Everything is clear
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

"My Inspirational Story"
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: All the best, Alice
11/01/24, 3:00 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Can I please write it on a paper instead and take pictures of my work
11/01/24, 3:00 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you
11/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

However kindly type section 1 here itself.
11/01/24, 3:02 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright thank you
11/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
11/01/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: I am here to continue please.
11/01/24, 4:23 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: We are here too
11/01/24, 4:23 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Sorry network problem
11/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
11/01/24, 4:24 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm ready
11/01/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Can your parents acknowledge their support for the same using a voice note, Alice?
11/01/24, 4:27 pm - +27 68 095 5880: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

11/01/24, 4:35 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
11/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024 for $200 and the  17th or 18th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
