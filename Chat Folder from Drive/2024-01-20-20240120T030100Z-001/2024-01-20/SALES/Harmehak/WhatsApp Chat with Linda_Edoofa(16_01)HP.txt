What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I heard that edoofa is a scholarship program that offers from 50-100 percent scholarships to African students to study at prestigious universities in India. It also provides an opportunity for one  to work and learn at the same time. The money is earned in form of scholarship credits that can be deducted from your annual fee after the scholarship. It also provides webinars that makes one skilled for jobs and other. It also helps you get to know more internship opportunities. 


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

Because I am a dedicated learner  and I am very passionate about learning new skills and languages that can  open new opportunities in my lfe.

18/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Received,

Did Nyasha share these questions with you earlier, Linda?
18/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 570 1724: She explained partially structural basis of Edoofa
18/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: I understand,

However my question is did she share these questions with you earlier?
18/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 570 1724: No
18/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
18/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Linda?
18/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 570 1724: I think it means your fees is fully paid then afterwards you work and payback
18/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Which all fees are you referring to please?
18/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 570 1724: 100% funded scholarsh
18/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 570 1724: Scholarship
18/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 570 1724: Thank you I didn’t know
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

18/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
18/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 570 1724: Yes it is what i am looking for
18/01/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Linda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

18/01/24, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/01/24, 9:49 pm - +263 77 570 1724: Good evening sorry for not responding i had a powercut
