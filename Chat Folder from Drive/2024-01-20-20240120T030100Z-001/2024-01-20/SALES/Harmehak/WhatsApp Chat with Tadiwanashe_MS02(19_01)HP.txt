18/01/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 633 8964: Sure
19/01/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue Bsc Agriculture, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 633 8964: Yes l would love to . It has everything l need to know about
19/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: That's great
19/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Alright Tadiwanashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 633 8964: I see myself as a successful young  man. It can enable me by showing me the right path and business opportunities to tackle.
19/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: That is great Tadiwanashe, I admire your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 633 8964: Abroad they is availability of  working stations, materials , technology and even better teaching skills. Whilst here in Zimbabwe jobs are not that available for graduates who have completed their studies. Some are staying at home. Shortage of materials is present here in my country.
19/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwanashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
19/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 633 8964: Noted
19/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tadiwanashe!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
19/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 78 633 8964: It has the best education institutions and a lot of students from foreign countries come there to find  education.
19/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Very correct
19/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

19/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Tadiwanashe!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
19/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 633 8964: None of us have any ideas on the costs
19/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Alright please
19/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 633 8964: Question. How much do those under scholarships pay
19/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 633 8964: Understood seems your country is cheap than others
19/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
19/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 633 8964: I see that it is beneficial to every student during earn while you Learn. Your prices are reasonable
19/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tadiwanashe!
19/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
19/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 633 8964: I agree on that
19/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 633 8964: I think l am
19/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
19/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

19/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: What's your take on the Earn While You Learn Program, Tadiwanashe?
19/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 633 8964: Are there more sections to select on beside these ones.
19/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Your EWYL mentor will discuss the same with you and you would opt for the one you are intrigued towards!
19/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Mr Harmony, you can participate too if you are following please.
19/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 395 2774: I am following but Iam  in the field where i have netwk hiccups,however let me say I am getting you well .All i need to know is when are the universities  enrolling gor first year students for 2024 and how much  are we expected to raise if Tadiwanashe is considered for the scholarship
19/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!

The enrollments are going on now itself.

The intake would be of August, 2024 please.
19/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: So far, with the costs related to Tuition fee, Accomodation and Food along with basic university expenses was discussed, which would be around $2000-3000.

The same will be reduced further with the Earn While You Learn Program.

Have you followed the same please?
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Meaning currently if he is successful we should be able to raise 3000 usd at once?
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Is the amount paid on full or  in phases?
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Not at all please!
19/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity!
19/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Mr Harmony, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
19/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Well noted.So how soon can we know the results so that we can prepare early
19/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: If you would be active like you have been so far, the results would be shared within 4-5 days itself!
19/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Ok thank you.
19/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: So did you also happen to understand the Earn While You Learn Mr Harmony?
19/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 395 2774: I have understood it and It is very important for Tadiwanashe to develop him and prepare him to be a n entrepreneur or good leader of a company
19/01/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Yes, Mr Harmony!

I appreciate that you understand everything and you have been thoroughly following the discussion.
19/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 395 2774: True and Iam very anxious about the response because Tadiwanashe is my heir he should be able to take the legacy of our grandfather as he was a great farmer and my father was an Agriculture extension officer in the Government of Zimbabwe for over 30years
19/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Oh thats really wonderful, Mr Harmony!
19/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: I believe Tadiwanashe is on the right path currently!

Given the right guidance and education he will definitely do wonders like his father and grandfather!
19/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Thank you .We are looking foward to that.
19/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be active for the next 20 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Mr Harmony, are we connected?
19/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Lets go but ther will be some delays a bit because of poor signal
19/01/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
19/01/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Mr Harmony, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/01/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 395 2774: I have just lost our netwk signal.
19/01/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
19/01/24, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: You can respond as soon as you are in a stable network.
19/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 395 2774: That is too much considering our incomes here
19/01/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/01/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/01/24, 5:59 pm - +263 77 395 2774: That will be equivalent to losing an entire year's income and the kid wont be able to go to school.I wouldnt love such a scenario.its better to apply at an instution that is reputaple once and you get it done and then work to raise money for the first semester
19/01/24, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, which is why we work thoroughly to provide a better experience of our dear students and their parents.
19/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 77 395 2774: So you are saying we have to pay an application fee of 350 usd by 31 January 2024,is that so?
19/01/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: It's paid after Tadiwanashe is found eligible and in installment.
19/01/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/01/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/01/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope so far you have a better clarity please? <This message was edited>
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Clear and loud waiting for the next step
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/01/24, 7:14 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Yes
19/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Mr Harmony!
19/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/01/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

19/01/24, 7:28 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Following
19/01/24, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/01/24, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

19/01/24, 7:37 pm - +263 77 395 2774: Thank ya
19/01/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/01/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/01/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
