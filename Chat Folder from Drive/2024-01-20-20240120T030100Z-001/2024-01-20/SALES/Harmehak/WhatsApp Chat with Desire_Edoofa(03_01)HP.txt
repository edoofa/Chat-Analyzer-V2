We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

I have a bachelors of social science in Economics to be specific and i was minoring in Accounting at the catholic university of Malawi and i would like to pursue with masters in Economics in India if a chance is given

Being a public speaker,team player,honest,dedicated and have good communication skills are some of my strengths.

My weakness is that i sometimes look down on myself,that's the only weakness i noticed so far

I love and i enjoy singing and reading different kind of books those are my hobbies

In my family i have both a father and a mother,my father works in a certain organisation in Malawi which is not a permanent job but rather a contract at ICAP while my mother is a civil servant and works in a department of agriculture,they both didn't reach to a degree level because of financial statuses,

My sister who is the first born has also completed her bachelors degree in social work while my brother is in first year,we also stay with our cousin and he is in highschool which in Malawi we call it Secondary school final grade

04/01/24, 2:35 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Please proceed
04/01/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the information interesting and helpful, Desire?
04/01/24, 2:41 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes though am still going through the pictures and reading but they are interesting
04/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/01/24, 2:51 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: On my side i don't have the knowledge about the cost for international students without scholarships
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Very high indeed
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Am Following please
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Is this for non scholarship students or it depends?
04/01/24, 2:55 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Which is very great
04/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
04/01/24, 2:56 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: I did not get it at first but after the other message,i understand <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/01/24, 2:57 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: My thoughts in this is that you are doing a great job helping students who are eager tp learn but have few resources to proceed <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

04/01/24, 3:00 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Interesting
04/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
04/01/24, 3:02 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Am loving the system,more brief easy for everyone to understand
04/01/24, 3:03 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: If the student does not want the credit to go to fees,it possible to give him or her the cash?
04/01/24, 3:03 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: And what do you do if the person fails to meet the required things to receive these credits?
04/01/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: No please
04/01/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: You are alloted dedicated mentors while you are still Malawi and they are with you during your entire course to assist you with projects and credits.
04/01/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/01/24, 3:15 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Ah alright then thats even more better
Thank you
04/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome

04/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
04/01/24, 3:17 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Not at all but if i have any along the way i will ask
04/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: But also since my parents are here maybe they will ask of they are not understanding
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
04/01/24, 3:22 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: I have a last question,does it mean we will be having meetings like this everyday?till everything is done?
04/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: You are referring to the current session?
04/01/24, 3:24 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes ma'am <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 3:25 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Maybe the question could be how often will you have meetings with them till everything is finalised?
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: The Counseling session would be concluded today itself in about next 30-40 minutes!
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: After he is found eligible he would be in regular touch with his EWYL Mentor.
04/01/24, 3:27 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Iam a female
04/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: I shall also connect you with a parent from Malawi once we conclude.
04/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the typing error please.
04/01/24, 3:27 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Its alright
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Infact she is a female student
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
04/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:36 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: What kind of assignments are these please? Are they education related?
04/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Did you go through the same please?
04/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Projects/Assignments are used interchangeably in the Earn While You Learn Program.
04/01/24, 3:38 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright i understand
04/01/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Now do you have any queries?
04/01/24, 3:38 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Well explained now
04/01/24, 3:39 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Not at all
I will just go through the whole conversation again for clear understanding
04/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/01/24, 3:52 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes iam
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Desire, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/01/24, 3:59 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: about $2250 right?
04/01/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/01/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/01/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/01/24, 4:14 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay
04/01/24, 4:15 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Wowwww🔥this is great <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 4:17 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: So the due date is this monthend?

So what happens to the money if the student is not picked from any university?
04/01/24, 4:17 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yah,i think its promising
04/01/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/01/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/01/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/01/24, 4:47 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh alright.....following with interest
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Your money is refunded!
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/01/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/01/24, 4:52 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
04/01/24, 4:54 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes am following please
04/01/24, 4:55 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes sure
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

04/01/24, 5:00 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine.....i get it
04/01/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:32 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright fine
04/01/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Dancila.vcf (file attached)
04/01/24, 5:51 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Am i suppose to text her or my parents?
04/01/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: All of you can connect
04/01/24, 5:53 pm - +265 888 03 87 59: Fine
04/01/24, 5:56 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Do you mean we can connect her before given acceptance letter?
04/01/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: You can connect with her now itself.
04/01/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: The acceptance letter is after Desire clear's interview stage
04/01/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Connecting with a parent will help you an even better clarity.
04/01/24, 5:58 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Okay
04/01/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/01/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/01/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!

05/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: That's great,

How was your experience, Desire?
05/01/24, 11:02 am - +265 888 03 87 59: I see that while shaping the future of education Edoofians are happy in India,every part of the video looks that the students are happy and satisfied with what ever os happening,and the board members are also doing their best to keep us in truck
05/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed and you had a great experience while going through the video.
05/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: So far, do you or your parents have any queries for me?
05/01/24, 11:04 am - +265 888 03 87 59: I do not have any questions

My parents are occupied i guess thats why they are not active but once they come online they will start being active please
05/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: That's alright please.
05/01/24, 11:05 am - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you
05/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Okay so Desire, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/01/24, 11:24 am - +265 888 03 87 59: 1. I would love to study economics though the Edoofa program

2.i would love to be in India and i believe the Edoofa program help students who are willing to study in india

3.in my country the average for non scholarship students is $6000-8000

4.the annual fee after getting the scholarship is $2000-3000

5.the enrollment fee is $350

6.i will have to pay within 7 days and the remaining part one is given 30 days to complete

7.yes, am clear...this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to india in 2 instalments (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Excellent, I am glad you thoroughly followed the entire discussion!

So are your parents willing to support you for the same, Desire?
05/01/24, 11:30 am - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes i have their full support in this
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please,

Kindly request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note, Desire.
05/01/24, 11:32 am - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright
05/01/24, 11:32 am - +265 888 87 29 48: As parents we are ready to what is supposed to be paid by us and looking forward for you humble and sincere consideration to make us proud since we are very willing that our daughter should go higher in education so that in the end she will have a better opportunity to have good work. Thanks
05/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I do appreciate please,

Since it's evaluation process, can you acknowledge the same using a voice note as well?
05/01/24, 11:35 am - +265 888 87 29 48: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
05/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:45 am - +265 888 32 08 00: Am fine dear and how r u?
05/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please,

Thank you!
05/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 10th or 11th January 2024 for $200 and the  10th or 11th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 10th or 11th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
05/01/24, 11:53 am - +265 888 32 08 00: I don't understand which is first between offering a place to a student and payments?
05/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Mrs Francina, the payments are made after/if Desire is accepted into the program after the interview.

If she is found eligible then only you pay the initial installment. <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: And right after that her Admission process would be initiated along with her Earn While You Learn Program.

I hope now you have a better clarity please? <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 11:55 am - +265 888 32 08 00: Ok darling I hear you,proceed
05/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: May I know which option would you as parents like to opt for please?
05/01/24, 12:01 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: We can opt for 2 option because like Desire said yesterday that we have a third born who is in first year (University) and thier cousin at Higher school secondary will both need school fees .. Hence to be at a self side option 2 can work for us better. Thank you
05/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand I believe you might have a confusion please.

Option 1 is paying in two installments of $200 in January and remaining $150 in February.

Option 2 is paying $350 as one payment in January. <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 12:03 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:04 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: You are very right we opt number 1 sorry.
05/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please, that is option 1 and I thoroughly appreciate your support for Desire.

Indeed, considering the finances commitments, the Academic Board allows the payment to be made in two fair installments.
05/01/24, 12:06 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Many thanks let us proceed today I am some how very busy but I will still follow the conversations

May I know what happened?
06/01/24, 10:08 am - +265 888 03 87 59: First i thought you said it's for parents and the board members

Secondly my phone battery died so i was in a place with no electricity

But i really thought the interview was for parents,since i did the written one
06/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I do understand!

It was an option if you wished to participate.
06/01/24, 10:09 am - +265 888 03 87 59: This made me think that its only for parents that's why my dad took part
06/01/24, 10:10 am - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay
06/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: However your father had a thorough discussion with the Program Director yesterday.

06/01/24, 10:55 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Hi Harmehak, what is so special to connect with Mrs Dancilla as it looks like its a must? Is she an Agent or what role is she playing in this ?
06/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Hello Mr Helecks,

It's not at all mandatory, I happened to connect you with Mrs Dancila, since she has a child currently in India from Malawi, so for the same itself it's better for you as a parent to hear from a parent who was in a same situation like yours back then!
06/01/24, 10:57 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Alright well understood
06/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Being a parent herself she does understand the concerns of other parents, which is the reason she gives her time to assist whenever she is available.
06/01/24, 10:58 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Will hear from Desire first how was their discussion went through then we as parent can take it feom there...thanks
06/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: You must have recognised Dr Abhinav, with Mrs Dancila's son in this picture too.
06/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Sure please
06/01/24, 10:59 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Well explained we thought she is part of your recruitment process.
06/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Not at all please.

The interview ended yesterday itself once you were able to connect with Dr Abhinav.
06/01/24, 10:59 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Perfect!!
06/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Would you like to ask anything else please?
06/01/24, 11:12 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Yes please, in case Desire is considered, do you write all detailed requirements on the acceptance letter mainly those that are supposed to be handled by parents?
06/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Yes please, every single detail is mentioned.

I am here to assist regarding the same later as well.
06/01/24, 11:17 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Alright thank you Harmehak. Another question is, what happened if parents did not manage to pay the agreed Enrollment fee within given 7days?
06/01/24, 11:17 am - +265 888 87 29 48: I know we opted the 1st option 200 first then 150 later...
06/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: While the Academic Board strictly follows the deadlines, as Dr Abhinav must have briefed you as well.

However, The board is empathetic if there is an emergency situation, then you have to pay a part of $200 before the deadline.
06/01/24, 11:22 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Ofcourse it was well explained and you have also eplained the restriction,but my question remains the same what happened if one fail to meet the deadline?
06/01/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Mr Helecks can you please elaborate the situation as to what shall be the cause of not meeting the deadline?

Though to address it, the application is closed itself and then the payments of $500 or the round of that intake, which ever is higher is charged at the time of reapplication, only if the application is reconsidered. <This message was edited>
06/01/24, 11:33 am - +265 888 87 29 48: In a situation where one is not sure whether the child will be picked or not you can use the money for other things then Boom acceptance letter comes out that require to pay within 7days. 

Secondly the period of 7 days is too short. You know financial status is not stable these days that is why I am curious to know incase it happens which I don't think it will happen any way
06/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: While I thoroughly appreciate your honesty, Mr Helecks.

If Desire receives an Acceptance letter today then only you pay the first $200.

To address your concerns regarding the admissions/acceptance, her documents and results have already been evaluated and the results are expected to be out soon! <This message was edited>

10/01/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon, how are you doing today?
10/01/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Since your deadline is of 12th January, that is day after tomorrow!

May I know by when are you expecting to complete the formalities?

Along with the same since you would require an Invoice for the payment, are you clear regarding the mode of transaction? <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 5:12 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: This likely to be facilitated tomorrow if not the same Friday, thank you
10/01/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Mr Helecks.

However I will have to get an invoice prepared for you to be able to complete the formalities from the accounts team.

Shall we connect tomorrow morning regarding the same in that case?
10/01/24, 5:53 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Do we need to have an invoice inorder to facilitate the payment?
10/01/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.

Your bank would require the same.
10/01/24, 7:18 pm - +265 888 87 29 48: Alright then we can connect tomorrow as suggested
10/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Sure please Mr Helecks.
11/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Helecks.

You would be using the following details please.

11/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: You can visit your bank in Malawi and fill out the telegraphic transfer form and deposit the amount after which the amount will be transferred within 2-4 days.
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: The invoice is required depending on the bank you would be visiting.

So if your bank would require invoice at the time of payment, you can update me and accordingly I shall update the Accounts team.
11/01/24, 10:36 am - +265 888 32 08 00: Ok following,and waiting to hear which university and what sponsed percentages this really matters to us.
11/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Mrs Francina, as I was earlier discussing with Mr Helecks, Desire's application would be take over by the admissions team after enrollment.

Now as you would agree that every student's academics and application are different from one another, one student qualifies for some universities while other might qualify for some completely different universities.

So the final percentage would be shared by the university when the admissions process would start.
11/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: You would receive applications from different universities, whereby you would yourself decide which university you would like to opt for!
11/01/24, 10:46 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Is it not okay as you said yesterday to produce the invoice in advance so incase the bank will need it will be easy than wait for another communication from your side?
11/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Let me get the invoice prepared in advance in that case.
11/01/24, 10:47 am - +265 888 87 29 48: Perfect
