18/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: That's great and noble, Huldah!

Did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine here in India?
18/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 161 5740: Yes Ive learnt that one needs to write the NEET exam
18/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Very correct
18/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 161 5740: Okay
18/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
18/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
18/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 161 5740: Ohh okay
18/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 161 5740: Do you also offer bachelor of Science in operational technology?
18/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Can you please share more regarding the same and your understanding of the field?
18/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 161 5740: You will be learning how to work in theaters and during operation and it can lead to a career path of general surgery <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I can understand and appreciate your knowledge.
18/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 161 5740: Thank you
18/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.

Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.

18/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 161 5740: Thank you, the reason why I want to study abroad is to acquire high quality education and get exposed to new and useful technology that may not be available in my country so that I may be able to provide good services for people living in my country.
18/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: You see, Huldah, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
18/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 161 5740: Yes that's true I understand
18/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Huldah!
