10/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 124 4424: That's great
10/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Indeed!
10/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I understand
10/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Well Sharline now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
10/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes it is a life changing decision.It gives students a chance to get higher education and experience.Learning abroad gives students like me opportunities that we can only imagine and might not get in our own home countries and it will be great to learn in a different environment and learn different cultures
10/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Sharline.

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
10/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I am mentally prepared for a life abroad 🙂
10/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Sharline, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
10/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes they are aware of my plans to study abroad and they are willing to support me
10/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their support, Sharline.
10/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
10/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 124 4424: Noted ma'am I will work extra hard
10/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Wonderful
10/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
10/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 124 4424: <Media omitted>

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Studying abroad is a great opportunity that makes you internationally employable and learn communication skills in new places with new people and better opportunities
10/01/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Sharline.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

10/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow all the shared resources and information, Sharline?
10/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 77 124 4424: I'm still viewing the pictures you sent
10/01/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: That's good.
10/01/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
10/01/24, 5:48 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Noted
11/01/24, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
11/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 124 4424: Morning
Yes we can start
11/01/24, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Were you able to follow the resources thoroughly, Sharline?

If so, did you find them interesting and helpful?
11/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I did
They are very interesting facts about India
11/01/24, 9:16 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/01/24, 9:22 am - +263 77 124 4424: I was told that it may range from 8000 to 7000 a year
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 124 4424: Very well understood sir
11/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 124 4424: **ma'am
11/01/24, 9:25 am - +27 60 360 0304: That'd be very helpful
11/01/24, 9:27 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
11/01/24, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mrs Judith.
11/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 124 4424: I think it is splendid, tertiary education becomes affordable and remaining annual fees can be catered for since the student can earn while they learn
11/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

11/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 124 4424: Fascinating indeed
11/01/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 9:36 am - +27 60 360 0304: How do they make earnings.?
11/01/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: The students participate in different projects to earn, Mrs Judith.

They would be allotted a dedicated mentor who assists them with their schedule and projects. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 9:38 am - +27 60 360 0304: Thanks so much
11/01/24, 9:39 am - +27 60 360 0304: It makes them responsible adults than just to be handed things
11/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 124 4424: Does the student have to stay in campus or they can go live somewhere outside campus
11/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Judith,

Along with the same they also get to learn the skills that will prepare them for their jobs.
11/01/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Sharline, let me help you have better clarity about the same please.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
11/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 124 4424: Understood ma'am
11/01/24, 9:46 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
11/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 124 4424: No ma'am everything is clear
11/01/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 124 4424: Still loading
11/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
11/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes indeed Edoofa is very different and excellent
11/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I'm ready
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Sharline, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
11/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 124 4424: $1500-$2250
11/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 124 4424: Noted ma'am
11/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 124 4424: Oh so there is guaranteed admission
11/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 124 4424: That is great
11/01/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Yes please
11/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 124 4424: Understood
11/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: That's great!
11/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
11/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 124 4424: Well understood ma'am
11/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 124 4424: So what happens if the student fails to pay the $350 fee
11/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: You proceed ahead with the application if only you and the parents are ready to pay the enrollment fee.
11/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I hope you recall it's paid in two parts of $200 and 150?
11/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 124 4424: Ok noted
11/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I do recall
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
11/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I did ma'am
11/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 124 4424: So this is what the visa looks like
11/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
11/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 124 4424: Ok ma'am
11/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I hope you are thoroughly connected with Abigail too, Sharline?

11/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: That's great
11/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Abigail as well.
11/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 124 4424: I'll do so
11/01/24, 11:27 am - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything?
11/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Your parents can feel free to share any queries they might have as of now.
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 124 4424: No thank you
11/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
11/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

11/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Dear Sharline and parents,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “11-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
11/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Thank you very much
11/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome pleasr
12/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Good Morning Sharline and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
12/01/24, 12:20 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Hi
12/01/24, 12:20 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Does the scholarship cover flights ?
12/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Yes we good
12/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
12/01/24, 1:39 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Ok thank you
12/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
12/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any other queries for me, Mrs Judith and Sharline?
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Non thank you
12/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth?

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
12/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Very well understood
12/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 124 4424: No ma'am I haven't connected with her
12/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: May I know what challenges you were facing?
12/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Challenges with what exactly
I'm lost
12/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Kindly excuse me please,

I was referring to connecting Abigail with your parents, Sharline. <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Oh I haven't but she does have their contact details
12/01/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

Do connect them with her shortly so that your parents can have a better clarity from a student who is currently in India.
12/01/24, 3:12 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Thank you
12/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
12/01/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

12/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Ok noted
12/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/01/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Sharline, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 77 124 4424: 1.Bachelor of Commerce
2.India
3.$8000-$7000
4.$2000-$$3000
5.$350
6.7 days
7.yes I am clear
12/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So are your parents willing to support you with the same, Sharline?
12/01/24, 5:56 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Yes we are
12/01/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/01/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: So as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
12/01/24, 6:02 pm - +27 60 360 0304: That'd be a relief to us.Our wish is to see our daughter graduate with a BCom or higher.
12/01/24, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support for her, Mrs Judith!
12/01/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
12/01/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
12/01/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
12/01/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:05 pm - +27 60 360 0304: We will try by all means to pay .
12/01/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/01/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21st January 2024 for $200 and the  20th or 21st of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21st January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
12/01/24, 6:06 pm - +27 60 360 0304: But she hasn't sat for Alevels yet?
12/01/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Student's proceed ahead on the basis of provisional admissions please.
12/01/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall going through the Edoofa Cycle please?
12/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
12/01/24, 6:34 pm - +263 77 124 4424: No we are not financially prepared
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Did you discuss with your parents, Sharline?
12/01/24, 6:37 pm - +27 60 360 0304: At the moment we are not,maybe towards midyear
12/01/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Judith, may I have a thorough understanding of what exactly are your concerns?

Kindly understand that I would be in a position to assist you accordingly itself.
12/01/24, 6:41 pm - +27 60 360 0304: We dnt have the funds at the moment.No concerns whatsoever
12/01/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand the same,

I hope you understand why the enrollments begin for 2025 intake now?

If/after Sharline is found eligible, they itself you begin with only the initial payment after you receive her acceptance letter.
12/01/24, 6:43 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Ok we will try by all means once she's eligible
12/01/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

I believe you had a misunderstanding that the fee is paid before she is found eligible.

However, I would like to inform if only she is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after her interview,

Then only you would proceed ahead!
12/01/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:49 pm - +27 60 360 0304: I will get in touch with her.Thank you
12/01/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mrs Judith!

Meanwhile, I would be submitting the application for a video call interview with the Program Director for the parents and a technical round with the students.

The slots for tomorrow are of 10:30 AM CAT and 11 AM CAT.

Which slot shall I reserve for you?
12/01/24, 6:53 pm - +27 60 360 0304: 11 is ok
12/01/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
12/01/24, 6:54 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Thanx
12/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Your interview has been scheduled for 11 AM CAT time, tomorrow. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.
13/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Good morning,

I just got to know about the same.

The interview will be conducted shortly.
13/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Dr Abhinav would be connecting at 12:30 PM CAT please.

Meanwhile Mrs Judith, did you connect with Mrs Ruth?
13/01/24, 10:58 am - +27 60 360 0304: Hi I have .
13/01/24, 10:58 am - +27 60 360 0304: Thanx
13/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries before the interview?
13/01/24, 12:50 pm - +27 60 360 0304: No
13/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Noted,

Kindly join the interview group.
13/01/24, 1:16 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Yes inam
13/01/24, 1:16 pm - +27 60 360 0304: I am
13/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: You messaged in the Counseling group.
14/01/24, 8:23 am - +263 77 124 4424: Good morning
14/01/24, 8:23 am - +263 77 124 4424: I was doing some research and I realised that Accounting is not much in demand and the graduates in Zimbabwe are failing to find jobs.
15/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
15/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes mam
15/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate more regarding the same, Sharline?
15/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 124 4424: Are Accounting jobs available or they are getting replaced by AI
15/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: While I shall definitely provide you a better clarity regarding the same,

Initially I would like to understand from you as to what are your plans after completing graduation in Accounting considering the same has always been your interest, Sharline?
15/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 124 4424: I want to develop in that area and maybe be a financial manager , marketing or even Human resources development
15/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great, I would like to add that you can pursue Bachelors in Business administration as well, Sharline.

However my question was regarding do you wish to work internationally or move back to Zimbabwe itself?
15/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 124 4424: No I want to work internationally
15/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, it's great to know of your thorough interests.

In that case may I know more about your query related to less jobs in Zimbabwe, Sharline?
15/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Some parts might need automation in future like every other field, but overall accounting jobs will still require a human being in order to properly do the task.
15/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Not letting private data become public is another major reason that Accounting is a field that would also require humans and not AI.

As the most pressing risk for accountants is that once information is submitted to a public AI tool, the data also becomes public.
15/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: You see, AI is more likely to complement Accounting roles by automating certain tasks only to enhancing the Accountants analytical capabilities.
15/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 124 4424: The rate of unemployment is high
15/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: You see, Sharline, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
15/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 124 4424: I'm glad you understand
15/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 124 4424: It surely is disheartening doing things like selling vegetables when you have a degree
15/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, I do understand, Sharline!

When we talk about international education, isn't the motive behind the same, that student after completing the education would get a good paying job in the country they are pursuing their education?
15/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I believe the parents also make extra efforts for their child for the same itself, isn't it?
15/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Yes surely
15/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 124 4424: The reason I asked is because I was considering changing the course I had chosen seeing the situation in Zimbabwe
15/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand.

I believe as of now your queries are addressed?
15/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Yes
15/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Thank you
15/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 124 4424: What is the rate of unemployment in India... just asking out of curiosity
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: In India, the unemployment is evaluated as per the sector,

May I know you are referring to which sector please?
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Kindly excuse me for the delay due to a technical issue.
15/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 77 124 4424: I don't know anything about the sectors
15/01/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
15/01/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: You see, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
15/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Noted
15/01/24, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Would you like to ask anything else, Sharline?
15/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 124 4424: No thank you 
Not for now <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: All right please!

How was your mother's call with the Program Director?
15/01/24, 7:34 pm - +263 77 124 4424: She said it went well
15/01/24, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great.

I believe all the queries are addressed as we speak?
15/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 77 124 4424: I'd like to believe so too
15/01/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

The results are expected to be out within 24-48 hours.
15/01/24, 7:37 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Now I'm nervous
15/01/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: That's normal, however have faith in God!
15/01/24, 8:10 pm - +263 77 124 4424: Amen 🙏
18/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon, I hope this finds you well.
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Alfred Kagura and Mrs. Judith Hlatshwayo as Sharline Kagura’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
18/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 4:19 pm - +27 60 360 0304: Wow that's good news
18/01/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate Mrs Judith!

Do take time to thoroughly go through the Acceptance Letter.
18/01/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you are delighted that Sharline has been offered higher quantum of scholarship as well?
18/01/24, 4:21 pm - +27 60 360 0304: I haven't opened the document
18/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Do take your time to download and read the letter properly.
19/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
19/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes please
19/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: So did you go through your acceptance letter, Sharline?
19/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 124 4424: Yes I did
19/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 124 4424: How come we making the payment in a local account
19/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the payment modes please.
19/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 124 4424: Ok
19/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
19/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA
