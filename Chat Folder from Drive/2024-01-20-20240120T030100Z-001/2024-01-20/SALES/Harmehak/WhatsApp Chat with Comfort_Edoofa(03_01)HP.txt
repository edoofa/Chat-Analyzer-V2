Thats all l remember
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a detailed discussion, Comfort!
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

04/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 696 8034: Ok thanks noted
04/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yeah true , l like this program a lot
04/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Comfort, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Nyashanu High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
04/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 696 8034: My name is Comfort Misi. Um a guy aged 17. Now um doing my Form 6 at Nyashanu High.At Nyashanu we paying 400 USD every term and i wish to study engineering but not yet sure which type of engineering.Actually i am talented in many sporting activities like soccer,athletics,volleyball,handball and swimming. 


My background is not that perfect but my parents struggle to meet financial issues because they have got many responsibilities.We are six in our family two girls and four boys and i am the third born.My father is a Health Officer with a Masters in Public health and my mom is a teacher.All kids we are still going to school
04/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Comfort, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your siblings please?
04/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 696 8034: The first one is studying nursing and the second one is studying environmental health n the forth one is a form 1 student and the fifth one is a grade 6 student lastly a little one not yet going to school
04/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Duly noted,

04/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Your mother is a teacher at which school please?
04/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 696 8034: A primary teacher at Raymondale primary
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Well Comfort, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
04/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 696 8034: I believe so if handled properly
04/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too? <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes um prepared
04/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Comfort, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
04/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes they are aware
04/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: I am glad,

Kindly address the other part of the question as well!
04/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes they are willing to support
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
04/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 696 8034: 100% confident
04/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: That's great
04/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
04/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 696 8034: A level subject combination Maths Physics Chemistry...
Because i feel like engineering is where i am called to and i am interested in it
04/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Well received please!

That's great,

So like you must understand there are various sub fields like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, etc,

May I know what fields are you intrigued towards, Comfort?
04/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ummm not yet mastered which field
04/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, while I am here to assist,

Which field are you intrigued towards, Comfort?
04/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Nuclear one or automatic is fine
04/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
04/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand, Comfort.

Even if you proceed ahead now, you are given an opportunity to change your course by the time your results are out as well.

So having shared that, did you ever happen to research about Engineering?
04/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Yes i did
04/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: What all did you learn and research regarding various fields?
04/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a fair knowledge, Comfort!

Were there any fields like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer science engineering that you ever researched about?
04/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Comfort.

So which field have you been most interested in from your research?
04/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Aerospace engineering was great in deed
04/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Now Confort, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
04/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ok i got it
04/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 696 8034: So whats really needed to do mechanical engineering
04/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: You can qualify on the basis of your subject combination please.

Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is a mandatory requirement.
04/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: I will discuss regarding the costs of the program in the later stage, Comfort.

Firstly, shall I brief you about Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering?
04/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ok go on
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

08/01/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, I understand.
08/01/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Nevison, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
08/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Provision of scholarships to my kids
08/01/24, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
08/01/24, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

08/01/24, 6:05 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Thank you very much with this eye opener. Besides scholarships,  can I also get employed by India
08/01/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
08/01/24, 6:13 pm - +263 77 392 5859: That's good for Comfort and wish if you can grant him a scholarship.
08/01/24, 6:15 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Myself being a professional with a masters degree in public health,  how can I get employment  I India
08/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same.
08/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: We currently assists with those who are pursuing their education in India as well please.
08/01/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/01/24, 6:31 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Very much familiar  but Due to low remuneration, it is quite impossible
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 6:43 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Well understood and the tuition is low for those who earn but unaffordable for us
08/01/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 10:04 pm - +263 77 392 5859: The program is excellent but the issue of affordability remains. Even if I try to save all I earn
08/01/24, 10:06 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Annually,  it won't amount to that little
08/01/24, 11:22 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mr Nevison.
08/01/24, 11:22 pm - Harmehak: Mr Nevison, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
09/01/24, 5:53 am - +263 77 392 5859: I agree but the situation is continuously worsening.
09/01/24, 7:41 am - Harmehak: Good morning,

Indeed, so how are you planning for Comfort's higher education, Mr Nevison!
09/01/24, 7:56 am - +263 77 392 5859: Just hoping for God's intervention.  Expecting you to be the Messiah at the right time
09/01/24, 8:10 am - Harmehak: I do understand,

Considering the same itself I shared the same with you, Mr Nevison.
09/01/24, 8:32 am - +263 77 392 5859: Quite understood.
The issue is with the foundation where the superstructure rests. There is no firm building without firm foundation. My base is a betrayal to all efforts, resulting into having wishes unlike horses
09/01/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: I do understand,

As of now do you wish to close Comfort's application?
09/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 392 5859: Not now maam
09/01/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: I didn't get you please
09/01/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
09/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 392 5859: Don't close the application madam
09/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

How shall we proceed as of now?
09/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 392 5859: If there are other processes imminent before Comfort's Upper 6 results, let me know
09/01/24, 10:55 am - Harmehak: We are currently in the discussion for the same itself,

However you mentioned the financial challenges after knowing the costs!

So how shall we proceed ahead as of now?
09/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 392 5859: Process his application and I hope by the time his results come, something positive will be underway
09/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I understand
09/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
09/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 392 5859: Well explained. Give us the offer by processing the application. We are to start saving now. Thank you very much.
09/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Alright, so far, what is your take on the costs offered.

Given that you would have to support Comfort with $1500 a year.
09/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 392 5859: We are now positive  towards the costs and support him with this amount per year
09/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
09/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
09/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

09/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Noted. One question I have now. Does this require participation of Comfort himself or any rep. Why asking? Comfort is at a boarding school where phones are not  permitted and there is also connectivity challenges to WiFi using a laptop. So communication with him will be in April after schools closure
09/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Comfort happened to inform me the same in my inbox.

You can continue on his behalf!
09/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Noted. Will try to continue on his behalf together with his mother
09/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
09/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
09/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 392 5859: With regards our point of discussion, I have no queries except waiting for it to happen.
09/01/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
09/01/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/01/24, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
09/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Going out of office now for home and no bundle now
09/01/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: The discussion won't take more than 15 minutes,

Since we are about to conclude I would appreciate if you can continue.
09/01/24, 6:52 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Office have been locked and WiFi switched off. Sorry for that mem
09/01/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Are you available now, Mr Nevison?
09/01/24, 7:16 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Let's talk mem. Have bought 10 MB data
09/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Comfort, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
09/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/01/24, 7:25 pm - +263 77 392 5859: A lot of money ranging from 1500 - 2250
09/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
09/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr Nevison, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 77 392 5859: What you are saying is quite reasonable. But when will the 350 application fee be needed
09/01/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
09/01/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/01/24, 7:44 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Noted. This option seem better due to our high cost of living
09/01/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/01/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
09/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/01/24, 7:56 pm - +263 77 392 5859: Yes, I understand
09/01/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
09/01/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
09/01/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

09/01/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Please do.
09/01/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
09/01/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
