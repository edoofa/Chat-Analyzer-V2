12/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 531 5942: My name is Blessed Ingwani. I was born on 10 February 2005 and I'm 18 now. I live in a small village called Makwaha. My father is a teacher and my mother is an agricultural extension officer. My parents know the importance of education and they give in whatever they have to make sure that we go to school but up to a certain limit. I attended my primary school at Mafumise primary school and I scored 10 units. I then attended High School at Mt Selinda High and I managed to get 4As and 6Bs doing pure sciences. I came back to Mt Selinda High again to do my A level because it was the one which my parents could afford. I was doing Mathematics Physics and Chemistry. I downloaded the results and I found out that I got 14 points. 
I want to do electrical and electronic engineering and our duty as engineers is to solve problems. That's where my big dream is. I am a man who's good at team work, reading, hard working, creative and I'm a person who strives to be a better somebody in the future. I am a good at socialism. 
My favorite hobby is playing darts and chess since they are smart games and they improve mental calculation and thinking capacity. I managed to go to the national darts championship and I can in position 4

13/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 531 5942: India offers a lot of scholarships and quality education. On Facebook I met almost 20 scholarships
13/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 143 1909: Good to hear
13/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
13/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 143 1909: I am not aware about fees structure can you shed more light
13/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Sure please
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.

15/01/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Blessed,

I am expecting to hear from you since Saturday!

While the other students from the school have already reached Interview Stage.

May I know the reason behind such delay from your end?
15/01/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 531 5942: I was doing the processes of applying for a passport which is the very important thing on the scholarship issues. I apologize for poor communication. I think the process will be over tomorrow.

15/01/24, 8:49 pm - +263 77 531 5942: Im really sorry 🙏
15/01/24, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Blessed.

Let me schedule the discussion for tomorrow at *9:30 AM CAT*.

Wishing you all a blessed evening ahead!
15/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 531 5942: The passport processing is  not yet over. They start the processing at 8:00 until late. So tomorrow I might not be available. Will you please allow me to finish the process
15/01/24, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: That's alright Blessed.

However you can request your parents to finish the discussion on your behalf.
15/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 77 531 5942: Thanks you. My parents will be available
15/01/24, 8:57 pm - +263 77 531 5942: But my father is a teacher so he might be at school on 9:30
15/01/24, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

Either of them can continue.
15/01/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 531 5942: It's ok thank you
15/01/24, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
16/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 143 1909: Am really so for coming late for discussion. Network is a problem herr
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
16/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far please?
16/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 143 1909: Thank you Yes I am following discussions and am understanding more and more
16/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
16/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: @263771431909
16/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 143 1909: I think it's quite good because my intention is for my child to get a scholarship for him to archeive his wishes. 100% will be greatly appreciated.
16/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your kind words and support for Blessed!
16/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 143 1909: You are welcome
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

16/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I hope you now understand how the Earn While You Learn Program will assist you as well as Blessed, Mr Ingwani?
16/01/24, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
17/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 77 362 1263: Good morning
17/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 362 1263: It's Blessed. Im going to use my mother's phone
17/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 362 1263: I went through the EWYL program but I need to something. Does the EWYL program start now?
17/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Good morning Blessed!
17/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
17/01/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

It would start as soon as you become a part of the Edoofa scholarship program.
17/01/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 362 1263: Noted
17/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: You would be alloted a dedicated mentor while you are still in Zimbabwe who would be with you throughout your journey!
17/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 362 1263: The EWYL program is so helpful. I really appreciate this program
17/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words!
17/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: You would a alloted your EWYL Mentor who would assist you with your Earn While You Learn Program!
17/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 362 1263: I can't wait to be an Edoofa member so that I can start
17/01/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

I hope you have thoroughly understood about the Earn While You Learn Program now, Blessed?
17/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 362 1263: Ok thank you. That way I think the program won't be hard for me
17/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 362 1263: Clearly understood
17/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Blessed!
17/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
17/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 362 1263: Yes I'm ready
17/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Blessed, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
17/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 362 1263: For a recommendation letter I have to go to my school.
17/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 362 1263: $1500-2250
17/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

However the admissions team will inform you on when to do the same.
17/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 362 1263: Ok noted
17/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 362 1263: I really appreciate the job being done by Edoofa. $350 is affordable. My parents are not at home so I need to here what they think
17/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 362 1263: They might be back by 16:00
17/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please!

They can follow once available.
17/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Ok
17/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.

17/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Yes Edoofa is making things easy for the students
17/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
17/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Excellent explanation. It's clearly understood
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 362 1263: I'm following and understanding
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Blessed!
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 362 1263: So after this $350, will there be some money needed?
17/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
17/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Understood very well
17/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
17/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: The $350 is the enrollment fee that includes, *assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* 

However after the same you would begin with your admissions process only.
17/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: I hope after going through the Edoofa cycle you have a better clarity?
17/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 362 1263: I am typing to say that is $350 the only amount needed throughout the process till I reach India
17/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 362 1263: I'm getting you
17/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: If you are accepted into the program, then only you $350.

Now after paying the same you would begin with your admission process only.

There is no other processes.
17/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
17/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

17/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Yes
17/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Now I understand
17/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: That's good.
17/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Understood
17/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Blessed are you aware that the child of the Deputy Head of Mt. Selinda is also a part of the Edoofa program?
17/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 362 1263: No I'm not aware and I don't even know the child
17/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Did the child finished A level last year
17/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: She is yet to finish A level.

Currently both A level appeared and Upper 6 students are being enrolled into the program.

While the 2024 intake is expected to close soon.

The enrollments for 2025 intake are already going on!
17/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However you must be aware of the deputy head, isn't it?
17/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 362 1263: So it means I can inform the current form 6 student about Edoofa program ?
17/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 362 1263: 😅 I usually mind my own business
17/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Yes you are right
17/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, you can
17/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand!
17/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

17/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Thank you so much. Let me get in touch with her
17/01/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
17/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Thank you. The network is down but I will download the video when the network is back
17/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

You can go through the same once you have downloaded the same.
17/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 362 1263: Ok thank you
17/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
17/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “18-01-24” at 11:30 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.
