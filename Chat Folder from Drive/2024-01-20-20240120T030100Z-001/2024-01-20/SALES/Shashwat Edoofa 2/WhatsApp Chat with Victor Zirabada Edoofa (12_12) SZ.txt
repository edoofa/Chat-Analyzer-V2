Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: From my research medical studies abroad primarily offer a chance to widen one’s perspective, and be familiar with the international medical field. All of which can give me an edge in the arena considering that practicing medicine is a global career. And it would also offer an opportunity to see more of the world generally. 


As I have always looked up to my relatives from abroad pulling more of the weight of the whole family's difficult struggles all pushing me to become a better self to be able to pull my own weight and help the coming generations of my family to live a better life.
This would be the main motivation to working hard
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Year of completion of A level is 2023
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I will arrange for the scanned pictures as soon as I can
21/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Victor! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will be waiting for your response, Victor.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 71 300 2882: Not yet can we begin at 10:30am
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Victor!
16/01/24, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
16/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 300 2882: I want to go and collect my hard copy of the A level certificate at my school, and network may falter as i go there and back. I wouldn't want to seem ignorant to our session by replying late.
16/01/24, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Victor. Let us connect at *10:30 A.M. CAT* to resume your session. I will be looking forward to your response.
16/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I'm now ready to connect
16/01/24, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Victor, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
16/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I was pursuing all four subjects at the beginning of my Grade 12th year but the weight/pressure became intense and as uninformed as I was then and with poor career guidance. I had believed writting Biology was the best way forward only to discover later that physics is a mandatory subject to pursue what I want abroad.
16/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 300 2882: It is a crucial science
16/01/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Okay soo with my combination wah courses can India offer

19/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 300 2882: I'm done sir
19/01/24, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
19/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 300 2882: India opens many opportunities, offers many benefits and affordable when learning. In pursuit of one's career these would definitely aid me in paving the best path for my career.  Through rigorous training and dedication I would claim my post as a technologist.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 300 2882: 1400-2000
19/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I'm not sure
19/01/24, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Victor! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
19/01/24, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
19/01/24, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
19/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
19/01/24, 3:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
19/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Yes
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Victor. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
