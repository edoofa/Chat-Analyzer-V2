17/01/24, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech. Mechanical

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/01/24, 4:48 pm - +260 770484156: No I’m not
17/01/24, 4:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Shekinah! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/01/24, 4:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 4:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/01/24, 4:50 pm - +260 770484156: no it’s not can a scholarship be given? <This message was edited>
17/01/24, 4:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
17/01/24, 4:53 pm - +260 770484156: The one for $6000-$8000
17/01/24, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
17/01/24, 4:57 pm - +260 770484156: Ohh I have just understood the message
17/01/24, 4:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please?
17/01/24, 5:00 pm - +260 770484156: It is affordable
17/01/24, 5:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shekinah. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
17/01/24, 5:01 pm - +260 770484156: Yes please
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shekinah. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/01/24, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
17/01/24, 5:05 pm - +260 770484156: I feel it will be a good way to help with the payment of fees . It will be beneficial
17/01/24, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
17/01/24, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
17/01/24, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
17/01/24, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

17/01/24, 5:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
17/01/24, 5:21 pm - +260 770484156: Yes I understand fully that it can be done
17/01/24, 5:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/01/24, 5:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/01/24, 5:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/01/24, 5:24 pm - +260 770484156: The 4th point is very good
17/01/24, 5:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Shekinah! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
17/01/24, 5:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/01/24, 5:26 pm - +260 770484156: They feel it is a very great opportunity for me to gain quality education and are happy with it.
17/01/24, 9:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
17/01/24, 9:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
17/01/24, 9:56 pm - +260 770484156: Yes it is
17/01/24, 10:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 9:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." - Malcolm X*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 770484156: Yes I am
18/01/24, 1:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Shekinah!
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 770484156: Well understood
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.* <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 1:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 770484156: Well understood
18/01/24, 1:46 pm - +260 770484156: What is the pass mark for grade 12?
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shekinah. The minimum eligibility criterion for the scholarship requires a student to have secured a minimum of 40% marks in every subject in their Grade 12 examination, please.
18/01/24, 1:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/01/24, 1:55 pm - +260 770484156: I understood that applying to a university abroad costs more than 1350-1750 without Edoofa,but if you are part of the program you get to pay $750 and now since Edoofa has looked at the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic they have narrowed it down to $350, which can be payed in two installments: $200 within 7 days after being accepted by the program and $150 with 30days. When you pay this you are assured of a scholarship with Edoofa.
18/01/24, 1:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

18/01/24, 1:58 pm - +260 770484156: We have discussed the first 5 stages and I am on the 1st stage right now.
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 770484156: Yes please
18/01/24, 2:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/01/24, 2:28 pm - +260 770484156: Yes I am

19/01/24, 10:32 am - +260 770484156: Yes they are
19/01/24, 10:34 am - +260 96 6193153: Yes
19/01/24, 10:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Bernard!

19/01/24, 11:08 am - +260 96 6193153: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zambia economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
19/01/24, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

19/01/24, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 25th or 26th January 2024 for $200 and the 25th or 26th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 25th or 26th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
