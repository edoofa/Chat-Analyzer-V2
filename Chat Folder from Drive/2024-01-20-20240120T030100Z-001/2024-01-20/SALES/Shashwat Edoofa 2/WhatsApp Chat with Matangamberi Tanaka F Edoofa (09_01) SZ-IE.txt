*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 088 4277: Good morning
I am ready
12/01/24, 9:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tanaka!
12/01/24, 9:02 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
12/01/24, 9:05 am - +263 78 088 4277: A wonderful day full of surprises
12/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 78 088 4277: So healthcare is out because of my Alevel subjects
12/01/24, 9:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. Biology serves as a foundational and integral prerequisite for pursuing any healthcare course due to its fundamental relevance to the human body, its functions, and the principles of life sciences.
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 088 4277: Ok technically it's impossible for me to pursue healthcare. So I must venture into engineering
12/01/24, 10:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Tanaka. Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
12/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 088 4277: Aerospace is amazing but I am also interested in air traffic control
12/01/24, 11:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
12/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 088 4277: Growing up I always wanted to be a pilot but then after I saw this documentary Apollo 1 I wanted to be in the background making sure everyone reaches their destination safely
12/01/24, 12:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. Your shift in aspirations, inspired by the Apollo 1 documentary, reveals a profound interest in ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals during their journeys. Pursuing a career in mechanical engineering aligns perfectly with this passion. As a mechanical engineer, you would play a crucial role in designing, developing, and maintaining the intricate systems that contribute to the safety and reliability of various transportation modes, including aircraft.

May I know whether you find that fascinating, please?
12/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 088 4277: It's really fascinating especially the part where I will be able to design and develop my own designs in the aircraft department and all other transportation modes. Also by studying abroad I will be exposed to modern technologies which are not available on this part of the continent, it will be an honor
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech. Mechanical

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

12/01/24, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Wow the energy is indeed electrifying! However, as your concierge, I'd like to inform you that the career path you've selected will necessitate a high level of responsibility and devotion. 

So, are you ready to give it your all and overcome all the obstructions?
12/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I am ready to give all I have for it, this is a dedication to my parents and I can't afford to mess it up especially after all that has transpired for me to get where I am today. And I know with their blessings and prayers I will sell through anything just like before. I am ready.
12/01/24, 3:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I admire your willingness to put in the effort necessary to advance your career. 
I trust you will conduct further research into the course.
12/01/24, 3:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, now that you have a clear picture of your career and an understanding of the program, do you know which countries Edoofa suggests for higher education?
12/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I only heard of India
12/01/24, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! *Edoofa* strongly recommends *India* for higher education! May I know what is your knowledge of India and the Indian Education System?
12/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Sry my phone's battery died. India has one of the best tertiary education facilities that are internationally recognized especially in the medical and engineering departments. The system also teaches one to be diverse because it has various activities done outside the classroom creating a wholesome someone in the society.

13/01/24, 9:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Tanaka.
13/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 088 4277: I have read all the information. India is really a well renowned country. I didn't know it has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The education is top notch and so diverse producing world class CEOs. The education system is really what I am looking for because besides providing quality education it has opportunities afterwards. Even locally it is rich because tata and Mahindra are well established companies one would wish to work for. Because of the cultural values it's a good learning environment with favourable conditions that do not suffocate one socially. Thank you for the insight I got a chance to gain knowledge of some things I didn't know about India.
13/01/24, 10:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
13/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 088 4277: India provides quality education because the institutions are renowned and they have highly qualified faculty members some who are already in the field who can mentor you in the right direction. The degrees are globally recognized and they create a vast range of opportunities. The campus life is friendly and not isolating. Education is also at a cheaper and affordable price with scholarships involved which is an advantage for me because of my financial situation. Using English as a way of communication will also enable me to socialize with others since I am not good at India's local language which also saves me time to try and fit in unlike in countries like China where you have to study chinese first. India has a fast growing economy which guarantees employment after completing the course. Also because of international recognition I can achieve my goals because I will have an opportunity to work for the best companies in the world expanding my knowledge whilst taking care of my family. If all goes well working for a company like Tata is an achievement in a fast growing economy like India enabling me to achieve my goals.
13/01/24, 11:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
13/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I have colleagues who might be interested but they might not be comfortable with studying abroad, I will hear from them
13/01/24, 12:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in my response. I want to assure you that, I am currently engaged in a meeting with the academic board to carefully review and discuss your application. Your patience and understanding during this process are immensely valued, and I genuinely appreciate your cooperation. Rest assured, I will reach out to you with updates and further information. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter!
13/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Thank you
13/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 088 4277: It's ok

15/01/24, 8:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." - Dr. Seuss*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
15/01/24, 9:00 am - +263 78 088 4277: Good morning I am ready
15/01/24, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tanaka!
15/01/24, 9:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tanaka! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
15/01/24, 9:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 9:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
15/01/24, 9:22 am - +263 78 088 4277: I think my parents will try by all means to assist me even though it will be really tough for them that's why I was interested in the Earn while You learn program you offer which would make life easier if I were to contribute to the expenses too
15/01/24, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
15/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 088 4277: That would be fantastic so how does one get eligible for this special cover
15/01/24, 10:57 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. If you perform exceptionally well during the evaluation process, you will be eligible for this exclusive scholarship, please!
15/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 088 4277: Sorry for the late reply I was encountering some challenges. So what is required for me to perform well for this evaluation process so that I can be eligible for the exclusive scholarship. I am looking forward to it because it is critical for my success story.
15/01/24, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media page to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/edoofa/
15/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 088 4277: Ok
15/01/24, 1:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews!
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Furthermore, Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
15/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Yes, sure
15/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 1:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/01/24, 1:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
15/01/24, 1:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
15/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I think this will be beneficial since apart from credit points that can be used to pay fees one gets the chance to have excellent working experience preparing to be good workers after completing the course. Also the association with other brands like skooqs one gets exposure to what they are pursuing and employment opportunities after graduation. The webinars also help in creating a wholesome individual because one will be getting advice from those who made it and encouragement that it is possible and even how they can make their career a successful one after graduation. The EWYL program is really an outstanding factor that will be beneficial to me in achieving my goals.
15/01/24, 2:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
15/01/24, 2:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
15/01/24, 2:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
15/01/24, 2:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

15/01/24, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
15/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I have realized that with consistency and hard work. The EWYL program can really ease the financial pressure but it comes with discipline and determination in order to earn the scholarship points.
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
15/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
15/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I appreciate the EWYL program the most because apart from easing the financial pressure you get working experience whilst you are still schooling and you become employable because the other organizations that you work for might offer you a job after graduation.
15/01/24, 2:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Separation in a family is very hard. You always support each other through thick and thin. At first my mother was content with the decision but she later approved and everyone else did not have a problem so my family is happy about studying abroad. They are supporting me to push hard so that I can get the scholarship and chase after my dreams and also with the EWYE program they feel it is worth it. I have everyone's blessing on this one and I know that with their blessings I will achieve great things.
15/01/24, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
15/01/24, 2:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
15/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Sure that is our family's wish to have a better livelihood
15/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Ok that will be great
15/01/24, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
15/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 088 4277: -Academic Qualifications
-Language Proficiency
-Study permit ( other countries)
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
15/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 088 4277: This is great news Edoofa is really determined to execute its goal. So the $350 is only for January?
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 088 4277: That is true money is a hustle on this part of the continent. The flexible payment plan eases the pressure and also reduces the decline of students from the program due to money issues which the program is trying to help.
15/01/24, 4:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
15/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I understood that Edoofa is trying by all means possible to ease the financial burden the applicant has by providing aid with some of the process expenses and also through the EWYL program, students can earn credits to cover their tuition. Edoofa is really the ideal program in assisting students financially.
15/01/24, 5:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
15/01/24, 5:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:38 pm - +263 78 088 4277: From what we have discussed so far I think we have all stages but we did not get into greater detail for all the stages. As for me I am at stage 1 of the cycle.
15/01/24, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/01/24, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 8:42 am - +263 78 088 4277: Good morning I had connected the phone onto the charger I didn't know the session would extend to 9pm
16/01/24, 8:42 am - +263 78 088 4277: Yes you can go ahead and explain
16/01/24, 8:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself." - John Dewey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 78 088 4277: Yes I am ready
16/01/24, 9:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tanaka!
16/01/24, 9:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
16/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 088 4277: A wonderful day it is. I hope you are enjoying your day too.
16/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 088 4277: I am getting it so I want to be clear if I understand everything clearly. First you pay 350 for applications then secondly another 350 for enrollment fee and finally then the 500-1000
16/01/24, 9:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
16/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 088 4277: After payment of the above mentioned services then you pay the 500-1000 which will be part of the fees right
16/01/24, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This registration fee isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself, Tanaka.
16/01/24, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Is there anything else you would like to inquire about or any other questions I can help you with?
16/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 088 4277: It's ok I get it
16/01/24, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Tanaka!
16/01/24, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
16/01/24, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*"The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education." - Martin Luther King Jr.*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 088 4277: Good morning
I am ready
17/01/24, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I trust that you've had the opportunity to discuss the points mentioned above with your family. I'm here to assist with any questions they may have. Would it be agreeable to proceed with your application now?
17/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 088 4277: We can proceed because some of the questions they had we resorted to the FAQ
17/01/24, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
17/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 088 4277: 1) B.Tacg Mechanical Engineering
2) India
3) 6000-8000
4) 2000-3000
5) 350
6) 7 days
7) yes
17/01/24, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are parents ready for the same, please?
17/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Yes they are unfortunately my father might not be reliable because he is in the countryside so the network is poor.
17/01/24, 1:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could they kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
17/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 574 6479: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
17/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
17/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 24th or 25th January 2024 for $200 and the 24th or 25th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 24th or 25th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
17/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 574 6479: Thus awaresome, As his parents we are ready to support him so can he confirm that he is willing to take the programe which is at hand.
17/01/24, 3:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Onismo! May I know which option is more convenient for you, please?
17/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 574 6479: Option 1
17/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I am willing but I would have loved to pursue radiology if it were possible
17/01/24, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
17/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 574 6479: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Tanaka, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
18/01/24, 9:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." - Malcolm X*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 088 4277: Good morning
I am ready
18/01/24, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tanaka!
18/01/24, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on this message, please?
18/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I want to pursue radiology
18/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I was out of data. Sorry
18/01/24, 8:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you are aware of the prerequisites to Radiology, please?
18/01/24, 8:26 pm - +263 78 088 4277: You mentioned that I should have done biology but I did it at O'level.
18/01/24, 8:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. To pursue a career in radiology, it is essential to have a strong foundation in biology during your A-level studies. Radiology involves the use of medical imaging techniques to diagnose and treat various medical conditions, and a comprehensive understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and pathology, which are covered in biology, is crucial for success in this field. Having a background in biology provides the necessary knowledge to interpret medical images accurately, understand the underlying physiological processes, and effectively communicate with other healthcare professionals. Therefore, including biology in your A-level coursework ensures that you acquire the fundamental skills and knowledge required for a successful career in radiology! <This message was edited>
19/01/24, 4:57 am - +263 78 088 4277: Where I am from for you to pursue radiology, at Alevel you have to study Maths and Chem,Bio or Physics. So I was really looking forward to radiology because that is what I want. To be honest engineering is a good department but it does not thrill me. I don't want to regret later in life for doing something I honestly have no interest in. So if radiology is out of reach, I am not turning down your offer but I want to try and get the course that i want.
19/01/24, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what intrigues you regarding Radiology, please? Furthermore, Could you kindly provide me with a comprehensive overview of your research on the course and its future prospects and relevancy in the ever-growing job landscape, please?
19/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Radiology is the science of studying human anatomy using advanced machinery. Being able to study what is causing illness and also diagnose is an amazing job because I will be saving lives. Also isn't it exciting to be among the people fighting cancer by detecting it to save lives. This is a good course with many career opportunities like radiologist, ultrasound technician and MRI technician. These are really good professions and I find interest in the MRI department. I want to be a great radiologist who assists people in need and not someone who discovers things in the engineering departments some that will not be for the greater good of everyone like Dr Oppenheimer whose bomb destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki all in the name of duty and achieving greatness in his work.
19/01/24, 1:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. May I know whether you are interested in pharmacy, please?
19/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 088 4277: Pharmacy is a good program but if I was offered radiology I would be thrilled.
19/01/24, 2:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: While the allure of a pharmacy program is undoubtedly commendable, it's essential to recognize that radiology, being a highly specialized field, demands a specific set of prerequisites. Biology, with its in-depth understanding of human anatomy and physiology, forms the very foundation of radiology. Unfortunately, your current subject combination may not align with the prerequisites for radiology, potentially limiting the eligibility for pursuing this program. While the prospect of radiology might be thrilling, considering your subject combination, it's crucial to explore alternative paths that align with your interests and qualifications.

19/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I might be proving to be an enemy of progress here but I want to know whether they don't teach human anatomy and physiology during the course of the degree so one can master all that is needed just like the machines used in radiology are studied more in physics even how they work weaknesses and advantages which is not part of the biology syllabus at Alevel but one can learn that later during the course of the program or maybe you don't accept someone who did Maths, Chem and Biology at Alevel too when it comes to radiology
19/01/24, 2:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The University Grants Commission (UGC) in many countries, including India, sets stringent criteria for pursuing medicine to ensure that students entering medical programs possess a strong foundation in relevant subjects. The criteria typically include a combination of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology as mandatory subjects, rather than Mathematics, Tanaka. <This message was edited>

19/01/24, 4:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations apart from Radiology, please?
19/01/24, 4:59 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I was aspiring to be a medical doctor but here it's out of reach with 11 points at Alevel and radiology was my second and final option since I progressed to A-Level. To be honest engineering was out of the question.
19/01/24, 5:11 pm - +263 78 088 4277: I accepted the other course because I really needed the Edoofa scholarship but later realized that I cannot slave myself with something I am not interested in and have no passion in because I will regret it later so poverty should not sabotage my freedom for the rest of my life.
