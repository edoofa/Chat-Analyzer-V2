11/01/24, 5:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Elison.
11/01/24, 7:56 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Yes I did sir
11/01/24, 7:56 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Thank you with the information
11/01/24, 7:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
11/01/24, 8:13 pm - +263 78 332 1461: As you said there is a room for research and innovation during the course, I think this will help me by finding it a bit easier on the field since it'll be something I learned back at school
11/01/24, 8:13 pm - +263 78 332 1461: This will really help as there will be no much new things in the field
11/01/24, 8:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
11/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 78 332 1461: I don't have any information about that as many people study at local universities or abroad bt being helped by scholarship programs
11/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Elison! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
11/01/24, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
11/01/24, 8:26 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Yhaa it is
11/01/24, 8:28 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Will I get or allowed to work at the same time learning under the scholarship
11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Elison. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
11/01/24, 8:50 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Yes sir you can it sounds so interesting
11/01/24, 8:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Elison. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 8:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/01/24, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/01/24, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/01/24, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/01/24, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
11/01/24, 8:58 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Olk yhaa thank you so much I appreciate
11/01/24, 9:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
11/01/24, 9:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
11/01/24, 9:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
11/01/24, 9:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

11/01/24, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
11/01/24, 10:03 pm - +263 78 332 1461: I see now ,I get it thank you once again sir
11/01/24, 10:03 pm - +263 78 332 1461: So is it compulsory or it's by choice to join
11/01/24, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Elison. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program is tailored for students to actively contribute to the financing of a substantial portion of their fees, thereby alleviating the financial burden on their parents. Additionally, this initiative is designed to equip students with invaluable real-life skills and practical training, fostering a holistic and empowering educational experience. However, benefiting from the Earn While You Learn program depends on the student's diligence.

12/01/24, 8:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 332 1461: Yes we can start
12/01/24, 10:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Elison!
12/01/24, 10:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 332 1461: Yes I did sir
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 332 1461: Morning
12/01/24, 11:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
12/01/24, 11:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
12/01/24, 11:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
12/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 332 1461: I can say I appreciate every point bt the EWYL is the best for me since it reduces the pressure from my parents
12/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Also the the practical is an advantage since there will be less new things in the field
12/01/24, 12:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers! So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

13/01/24, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this message, please?
13/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 332 1461: It's so exciting you know flying overseas finding better and quality education
13/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 332 1461: My results are out may I send them

13/01/24, 9:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Congratulations on your outstanding achievement of scoring straight A's in your A-level results! Your dedication, hard work, and academic excellence truly set you apart. This remarkable accomplishment reflects your commitment to excellence and the pursuit of knowledge. Your success is not only a testament to your intelligence but also to your perseverance and determination. Well done on this exceptional academic milestone, and I wish you continued success in all your future endeavors, Elison!
13/01/24, 9:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
13/01/24, 9:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 332 1461: Thank you so much sir
13/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Can you tell me more about the statement of purpose
13/01/24, 12:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in my response. I want to assure you that, I am currently engaged in a meeting with the academic board to carefully review and discuss your application. Your patience and understanding during this process are immensely valued, and I genuinely appreciate your cooperation. Rest assured, I will reach out to you with updates and further information. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter!
13/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Olk thank you sir
14/01/24, 7:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/01/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Olk thank you
15/01/24, 8:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." - Dr. Seuss*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
15/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Hello sir I was busy the whole day but tomorrow I'll be available
15/01/24, 9:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Elison!
15/01/24, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
15/01/24, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/01/24, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Morning sir
16/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 332 1461: So I pay nothing before I get accepted?
16/01/24, 1:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Elison!
16/01/24, 1:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Elison! However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 332 1461: But these payments are done after or before accepted?
16/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Thank you sir same applies
16/01/24, 1:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Elison. If you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receive the Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, then only you have to commence the financial process.
16/01/24, 1:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
16/01/24, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

17/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 332 1461: The Earn while you learn program help students to pay fees for themselves as they will get a room to work while learning which helps to lower the fees
17/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Bt sir l have a question,,,the funds from EWYL are used for fees only or I'll use them for other things
17/01/24, 12:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Elison. Numerous students who have exceeded the cost threshold have generously sent funds back home, demonstrating their commitment to supporting their families. Notably, one of our esteemed students, Persistance, even invested in a laptop! <This message was edited>

17/01/24, 12:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

17/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 332 1461: I think it's stage 2
17/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Yhaa sounds interesting olk I get it
17/01/24, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Yes you can
17/01/24, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
17/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 332 1461: Olk yes thank you I appreciate
17/01/24, 1:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/01/24, 1:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
