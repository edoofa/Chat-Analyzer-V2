03/01/24, 2:36 pm - +260 96 2686427: My name is Nicholas Moyo born on the 25th of May 1979 in Ndola Zambia ,I am a Zimbabwean by descent .I am currently persuing a PhD in Natural Medicine. Iam a Naturopathic Medicine Therapist since Feb 1998.Iam a Christian attending the Seventh Day Adventist Church.I and my family are Vegetarians including Esther.I got married to Patricia Moyo on 28 May 2003 on Charpter 37 in Zimbabwe ,this is a legal Marriage.We are Blessed with 5 Children ,1 daughter (Esther Princess Moyo ) and 4 sons .Esther is the eldest child .Both myself and my wife Patricia do practice Natural Therapies. This is our main source of income.
We are also small scale farmers growing grains,nuts ,vegetables and we have also started to plant fruit trees and medicinal Herbs.In Naturopath I do specialise in 
Arthritis
Cancer
Pain Management

We are a humble family which have not yet acquired much assets and due to the Economic Instability in our Country Zimbabwe :
It is very difficult to supply all our basic needs 
To fully pay the tuition fees on time 

But we hope the Lord will  open more windows so we improve our income flow.

Coming to our daughter Esther Princess Moyo:

Esther is born on 1 July 2004
She is our only daugher amongst 4 sons .She is of quiet character but with High Intellectual Capabilities. As the only daughter I forsee loneliness since she has noone to pair with ,but Tye Lord has blessed us with my wife's daughter now residing with us.
Esther is a Studious person 
She likes reading and Researching, she is an optimistic person hence she even got your contacts. I thought it fit for her to Study Medicine due to her caring spirit ,I see the way she takes care of her siblings .But she has chosen Social Work which is also good.She has chosen to be a sociologist.
She bottles most of her things 
she doesnt easily opens up ,she confides a lot.

The only weaknesses I know is on her Physical Health but not on character:She suffered Anaemia in her infancy and this has affected her physical Health.
Spiritually ,Mentally and Socially she is profound.

Esther is also a good Machinist ,her mother together with her school trained her in Fashion and Fabrics .She can even design and make her own dresses and costumes.This is an added advantage. 
We have trained our children to practice strict economy. She can survive in hard conditions with very little means .Survival skills.

I have never heard at school
church
Community
she being evil spoken of 
Even myself as a parent  I thank God for that character she has

Thank you <This message was edited>

05/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 617 9755: Thankyou I've all the information and it's well clarified
05/01/24, 5:13 pm - +263 78 617 9755: *read*
05/01/24, 5:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
05/01/24, 5:18 pm - +260 96 2686427: Besides the education fraternities even the health care facilities 
Most patients are referred to India for chronic illnesses diseases and infirmities but rarely have I heard of corpses returning in turn but a well improved person. 
Most of the natural remedial formulas I administer to patients are from India 

India stands as an unbeatable giant in NATUROPATHIC MODALITIES 
I ALSO VALUE THE DIGNIFIED MODE OF DRESS 

I VISIT MOST FAMILIES I SEE THEM WATCHING MOSTLY INDIAN MOVIES ETC. 
I personally would like my family to visit India even stay there for a lengthy visit
05/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 78 617 9755: I will have opportunity to learn about different cultures and perspectives which can be very valuable for a sociologist. I will be able to access research and academic resources that I may not have access elsewhere.

India is a diverse country which can provide me with a rich and varied learning
05/01/24, 6:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
05/01/24, 6:39 pm - +263 78 617 9755: No am not familiar
05/01/24, 6:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Esther! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/01/24, 6:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 6:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/01/24, 8:29 pm - +260 96 2686427: We shall communicate on Sunday or tomorrow after Sabbath 
We are Sabbath keepers
05/01/24, 10:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you." - B.B. King*

Are you ready?

06/01/24, 7:08 pm - +263 78 617 9755: I hope you had a wonderful day you all
06/01/24, 7:08 pm - +263 78 617 9755: I have some questions to ask
06/01/24, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Esther!
06/01/24, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel free to raise any queries, Esther.
06/01/24, 7:32 pm - +263 78 617 9755: Yes thankyou
06/01/24, 7:33 pm - +263 78 617 9755: So does it mean that each semester is $1000
06/01/24, 7:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Esther.
06/01/24, 7:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please?
06/01/24, 8:09 pm - +263 78 617 9755: Yes it is affordable
06/01/24, 9:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Esther. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
06/01/24, 9:10 pm - +260 96 2686427: We might face some challenges because of our current economic situation 
.I think the Edoofa student work opportunities while study ing may also help. But we will strive to start preparations now and savings.
06/01/24, 9:14 pm - +260 96 2686427: Since Esther seems to be more versatile on her proposed faculty 
Is it not possible for you to waive her and she begins with her 0 level results 
Or she has to first complete A Level? 
According to her intellectual stability reasoning and intelligence. I forse a mature person to be admitted for the course. That's my view.

08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Esther. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
08/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 617 9755: Yes this is so beneficial and it also helps to improve working skills
08/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 617 9755: In which semester is a student qualified to start the EWYL Program
08/01/24, 4:40 pm - +260 96 2686427: I meant that my phone had a technical problem. I couldn't type and space
08/01/24, 4:40 pm - +260 96 2686427: Even if the student is capable without completing A LEVEL , Can she not be accepted for studies
08/01/24, 4:40 pm - +260 96 2686427: Turn any situation into an opportunity and sit on the top. This is excellent
08/01/24, 5:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nicholas. Sociology is a bachelor's degree. Therefore, A-Level is a prerequisite to pursue this respective course, please.
08/01/24, 5:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Esther. Every student has the opportunity to commence their 'Earn While You Learn' journey right from Zimbabwe.

Additionally, they will be assigned a dedicated mentor who will provide guidance and support throughout their educational endeavors.
08/01/24, 5:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
08/01/24, 5:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/01/24, 5:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/01/24, 5:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

09/01/24, 9:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." - Nelson Mandela*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/01/24, 10:04 am - +260 96 2686427: Hallo sir 
May you check on Esther a request 
Schools are now open and she must concentrate much on her studies A level 
During the day she is much occupied 
How best can you reschedule on TIME MANAGEMENT 
So that she doesn't miss both 
More so the A LEVEL SINCE ITS HER MOST DETERMINING FACTOR FOR THAT SELECTION 
Thank you
09/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Nicholas!
09/01/24, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mr. Nicholas. I would like to kindly inform you that due to the limited availability of seats and the high volume of daily applications, we are adhering to a specific timeline for our sessions. If the student is unable to join the session, rest assured that his/her parents can continue and participate on his/her behalf. May I know whether you are available for the session right now, please?
09/01/24, 12:05 pm - +260 96 2686427: I can do the participation then brief her after school
09/01/24, 12:06 pm - +260 96 2686427: I'm available
09/01/24, 12:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/01/24, 12:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/01/24, 12:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/01/24, 12:20 pm - +260 96 2686427: 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
09/01/24, 12:22 pm - +260 96 2686427: This is the first and foremost 
The rest are all valuable as well 

Personally as a parent I value all your programs 
And hope my daughter will successfully stand a chance to experience a this through the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMME
09/01/24, 12:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how you feel about Esther studying abroad?
09/01/24, 12:28 pm - +260 96 2686427: Once she qualifies here the other 3 with surely fit in
09/01/24, 12:32 pm - +260 96 2686427: As I stated in our very first initial introductory conversation, it is of highest honour and a bridge to life especially to the world of technology. I'm feeling much honoured for my daughter to STUDY ABROAD. 
I need her to excel 
I believe in excellency.
09/01/24, 12:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents.
09/01/24, 12:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 96 2686427: Yes well said
09/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 96 2686427: Yes it is
09/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 96 2686427: International window and gateway to global opportunities
09/01/24, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
09/01/24, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/01/24, 1:33 pm - +260 96 2686427: Noted
09/01/24, 1:34 pm - +260 96 2686427: We are hoping our daughter to qualify for the Edoofa Application program
09/01/24, 1:36 pm - +260 96 2686427: I'm ardently and keenly following 
If I miss the point on answering you 
May you clarify without delay 
So we be on the same page in our conversation
09/01/24, 1:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
09/01/24, 1:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/01/24, 2:03 pm - +260 96 2686427: Noted 
So when can Esther enroll?
09/01/24, 2:03 pm - +260 96 2686427: Clear and straight forward
09/01/24, 2:04 pm - +260 96 2686427: Is this after completing A LEVEL WHILE awaiting for her results or while she is learning as it is now?
09/01/24, 2:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your concerns, please?
09/01/24, 2:18 pm - +260 96 2686427: I need to know when is Esther to enroll 
If she qualifies I see to it that her funds are ready for registration
09/01/24, 2:19 pm - +260 96 2686427: When is the student found competent and receive her Reservation letter?
09/01/24, 2:21 pm - +260 96 2686427: Thank you for caring for us
09/01/24, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nicholas. If the student is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives the Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, then only you have to commence the financial process, please.
09/01/24, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
09/01/24, 2:44 pm - +260 96 2686427: Noted
09/01/24, 2:50 pm - +260 96 2686427: As it has been stated I have followed every jot and its clear 
I adhere with all the programs 
I'm just awaiting for the acceptance letter 
Once done I think I did Private savings for my slaughter's higher Education MORE SO the Edoofa program. I'm ready for that I even informed my daughter this morning on what we discussed as her parents. 
We are only praying God to open a way for our daughter to be successful in the selection criterior not only herself alone but all the Africans similarly affected like us. 
This is my wish and prayer. Thank you
09/01/24, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*

09/01/24, 4:37 pm - +260 96 2686427: Thank you
09/01/24, 4:38 pm - +260 96 2686427: We are at stage 01
09/01/24, 4:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/01/24, 4:54 pm - +260 96 2686427: We are at stage 01 and 02 because we have discussed on acceptance
09/01/24, 5:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

10/01/24, 8:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"In learning, you will teach, and in teaching, you will learn." - Phil Collins*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/01/24, 9:20 am - +260 96 2686427: Morning sir how are you 
We are ready to learn and teach
10/01/24, 9:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I trust that you've had the opportunity to discuss the points mentioned above with your family. I'm here to assist with any questions you may have. Would it be agreeable to proceed with Esther's application now?
10/01/24, 9:29 am - +260 96 2686427: What is required in applications
10/01/24, 9:29 am - +260 96 2686427: How much money needed for application
10/01/24, 9:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended these messages, please?
10/01/24, 9:43 am - +260 96 2686427: $350 enrolment fee
10/01/24, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/01/24, 10:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether that is clear, please?
10/01/24, 10:29 am - +260 96 2686427: We are currently pressed with paying the children's school fees and tuitions 

We will get that amount first week of February 2024 
For now we don't have money 
We are really in a financial crisis now but need our daughter to do the applicatiion
10/01/24, 10:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly provide more details about your concerns regarding the financial dates, Mr. Nicholas? I assure you that I am here to address any issues, and I will make every effort to devise a more accommodating financial plan for you. There have been instances in the past where parents expressed their concerns to me, and in response, I advocated to the board for an extension of the deadline to ensure greater convenience for them.
10/01/24, 10:38 am - +260 96 2686427: I request extension of the deadline due to lack of finances 
At the present moment I do not have registration fee. Thank you
10/01/24, 10:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that the recent completion of Esther's fee formalities has posed some challenges for you in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
10/01/24, 11:13 am - +260 96 2686427: Yes im. Ready
10/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Esther's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Esther's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
10/01/24, 12:05 pm - +260 96 2686427: Thank you sir 
We will strive 

When is the 7 day period beginning?
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nicholas. Once Esther receives the Acceptance Letter, then only you have to start the financial process.
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether this is convenient for you, please?
10/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 96 2686427: Noted
10/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 96 2686427: Yes it is 
Let it be 
God will intervene
10/01/24, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
10/01/24, 1:02 pm - +260 96 2686427: You need voice notes now?
10/01/24, 1:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mr. Nicholas. Voice notes are essential for confirmations, while general responses should be communicated in a textual format, please. Your co-operation is highly appreciated!

10/01/24, 2:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Esther, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
10/01/24, 2:13 pm - +260 96 2686427: Yes 
In Lusaka I won't have any problems with network especially for video calls 
In Zimbabwe it has more challenges even electricity load shading

Because it's raining
11/01/24, 12:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nicholas. In the meantime, Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 96 2686427: 1 Sociology 
2 India 
3 $6000-8000 per year 
4 $2000-3000 per year
11/01/24, 12:42 pm - +260 96 2686427: 5 $350 
6 7 days 
7 yes I'm very clear about that.
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/01/24, 12:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I hope you are having a delightful day!
