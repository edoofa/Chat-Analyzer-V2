11/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 743 8652: HEALTH SECTOR 
Going back to when l was child around 5th grade my dad suddenly got diagnosed  with high blood pressure so l  always checked  up on him whether  he had taken his pills or not so from then onwards l always took it upon myself to take care of anyone who was sick at home and that is why l have a passion for the health sector.




ENGEENERING  SECTOR 
Growing up in a house full of girls we had to do all chores regardless  of how the community has set them aside to be male chores and that is also one of the reasons why l push for gender equality. Being raised in a family of only girls l have come to realise that the girl child can do any job the boy child can except for becoming the head of the house
11/01/24, 2:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your compassionate and caring nature, demonstrated since a young age, reflects a deep sense of responsibility and empathy. Taking it upon yourself to look after your dad when he was diagnosed with high blood pressure showcases not only your love for your family but also your commitment to their well-being. Your willingness to care for others who were unwell at home is truly commendable, highlighting your selflessness and nurturing spirit. Your actions exemplify the qualities of a considerate and empathetic individual who goes above and beyond to ensure the comfort and health of those around you, Makanaka!

12/01/24, 11:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Makanaka! India's education system is a reflection of its rich cultural heritage, combining ancient wisdom with modern learning. From the historic centers of learning like Nalanda to a contemporary emphasis on holistic education, India provides a diverse and well-rounded learning experience. This system fosters a global perspective, preparing students to navigate an interconnected world. The country's cultural diversity is a unique asset, teaching appreciation for varied perspectives and fostering unity in diversity.

12/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 743 8652: I have a passion concerning  renewable energy technologies in particular because global warming has taken a great toll in our lives especially for the farmers
12/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 743 8652: Im done sir
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
12/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Yes l am
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 743 8652: From the information you have shared with me l have come to realise that the Indian Education is just what lm looking for with an extra touch to it

1.l fell in love with the fact that India's Education system will provide me with a hands on practical approach to Electrical engineering giving me an opportunity to be taught by some of the world's best Professors which is truely an added advantage 

2.The Education system  is suited for everyone regardless of your background by offering student scholarship of up to 100% and even student loans  also providing a home away from home as it embraces and promotes cultural diversity 

Being taught in English gives the students a chance to interact with the global community opening up a large number of doors
12/01/24, 1:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
12/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 743 8652: When l did my research it was around an average 3500 USD
12/01/24, 2:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Makanaka! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/01/24, 2:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 743 8652: To be honest with you Mr Shashwat l do not think my parents can afford it but l think l would have to enroll in the earn while you learn programme and if l get a student loan because both my parents earn average of 700 USD per month of which from that money that is where my sisters and l depend on when it comes to school fees , food and other basic commodities
12/01/24, 2:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makanaka. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Well ,Mr Shashwat l have little knowledge about how the earn while you learn programme is done
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makanaka. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
12/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 743 8652: I think its a great programme and lm sure l will benefit a lot because lm getting to earn money for my education while l get an opportunity to learn more about the programme lm under taking at the same time being helped by the best in the industry
12/01/24, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
12/01/24, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
12/01/24, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/01/24, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

12/01/24, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Yes l have sir thank you for the assistance
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
12/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 743 8652: 2
12/01/24, 3:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Makanaka! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
12/01/24, 3:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 743 8652: My family feels delighted
12/01/24, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
12/01/24, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
12/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 743 8652: I agree with all you have mentioned above and in edition to that l think a study visa is required
12/01/24, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
12/01/24, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/01/24, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
12/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Wow
12/01/24, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
12/01/24, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/01/24, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
12/01/24, 9:50 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Mr Shashwat lm really sorry to disappoint you l came out with 7 points l dont think you and your team will still be intrested me.lm really disappointed in myself
12/01/24, 9:50 pm - +263 77 743 8652: Thank you for your time and once again lm really sorry
12/01/24, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on the matter, please?
12/01/24, 9:54 pm - +263 77 743 8652: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*, Makanaka!

*"The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change." - Carl Rogers*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session

13/01/24, 8:11 am - +263 77 743 8652: I was having a bad morning but seeing your news totally changed it
13/01/24, 8:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makanaka. I want to express my sincere appreciation for your unwavering dedication and hard work. Your commitment to giving your best does not go unnoticed, and it's truly commendable. In moments where challenges arise, and the path seems demanding, please know that your resilience and determination do not go unnoticed. It's completely normal to face obstacles, and what matters most is how you navigate through them. Remember that setbacks are not a reflection of your abilities but rather opportunities for growth and learning. Your continuous pursuit of excellence is a testament to your character and determination!
13/01/24, 8:19 am - +263 77 743 8652: I too am forever grateful to have had an opportunity to interact with you Mr Shashwat  and having you my counsellors acknowledge my determination and resilience means a lot to me truely.

13/01/24, 8:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
13/01/24, 8:28 am - +263 77 743 8652: From my understanding the Education For All Programme offers tertiary students an opportunity to study abroad by offering them scholarships from a range of 50-100% depending on their eligibility. Having been enrolled into the Edoofa's  Programme  it will lower the students fees and up keep up to around 2000 -3000 USD .The students who can not afford   to  pay that are then enrolled into the earn  while you learn programme  whereby they will earn credits which will then be converted to money which then lowers the money required annually
13/01/24, 8:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
13/01/24, 8:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 743 8652: Correct me if lm wrong but l think lm on the second  stage
13/01/24, 8:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/01/24, 9:00 am - +263 77 743 8652: Yes sir please go ahead we can not stop half way
13/01/24, 9:01 am - +263 77 743 8652: I agree
13/01/24, 9:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
13/01/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 743 8652: Yes l am
13/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 743 8652: But Mr Shashwat if am found eligible for the Edoofa's Programme and given an acceptance letter could you kindly assist me with proof reading my Application letter and correcting my mistakes when the time comes.
13/01/24, 9:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your query, please?
13/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 743 8652: So let us say l reach stage 5 am l allowed to ask for help from you when it comes to the proof reading of my Application letter into University or collage
13/01/24, 9:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Makanaka! Please don't hesitate to reach out whenever it suits you best. Our primary goal is to offer you career assistance, and our admissions team is committed to working closely with you to facilitate your admission to the University of your choice. Your convenience and satisfaction are our top priorities, Makanaka!
13/01/24, 9:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/01/24, 9:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

15/01/24, 9:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa?

15/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 743 8652: Yes we have done so

15/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 743 8652: She also highlighted that being part of the programme gives you enough time to prepare for your higher education
15/01/24, 10:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

*"The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education." - Martin Luther King Jr.*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/01/24, 9:14 pm - +263 77 248 9664: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Bernard!
17/01/24, 9:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/01/24, 9:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
17/01/24, 9:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
17/01/24, 9:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 24th or 25th January 2024 for $200 and the 24th or 25th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 24th or 25th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
18/01/24, 9:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today." - Malcolm X*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 743 8652: Good morning sir
18/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 743 8652: Yes lm aware of that quote it's one of my favourites
18/01/24, 10:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Makanaka! Malcolm X's quote, "Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today," encapsulates the timeless importance of education as a transformative tool. It underscores the profound impact that learning and knowledge have on shaping our future. The metaphor of education as a passport not only emphasizes its role in opening doors to opportunities but also implies that it transcends borders, enabling individuals to navigate the challenges of an ever-changing world!
18/01/24, 10:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know which option is convenient for your parents, please?
