Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
19/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 588 5723: I was thrilled when I saw the scholarship opportunity and with this letter I would like to express my gratitude to the government for this program.I've completed high school and I came out with 13 points and I wish to pursue medicine at a tertiary level.

In high school, i was an adept biology student and a critical thinker. My passion to save lives, made my career path so clear, that i did not have to think twice about it. I believe there is more I will contribute, to the medicine world with my personal zeal and the benchmarks i have set for myself. I believe with research and personal drive, there are some solutions to problems which the world has left alone and claimed not feasible to cure. 
My vision is to make sure that, people benefit from the skills i would have acquired and to help in running many health institutions. The other key thing i believe in, is to strengthen service delivery, so that like the days of old, people have all their faith in the doctors. My arsenary of skills from good communication skills, empathy and hardworking, draw a rift from the rest 

Having spent most of my time in an environment that requires me to work hard even to get the small things has helped me to aspire, have dreams and set goals that I need to achieve.Even though I claim to have a vision for my goals I feel like it's just a dream that is yet to be brought to reality as there are a lot of obstacles that need to be overcame.

I spent most of my childhood in Bindura at Muchapondwa Primary School where my parents were teachers.We didn't have much as a family but at least we were well to do.We then relocated to Arcturus Mine when my father passed on  in 2015 due to liver cirrhosis.This really affected our family as our father was the breadwinner and from then my mother had to take care of us on her own.My mother failed to maintain some of the standards that my brother had to drop out of boarding school.In primary I struggled a lot as I could not fit in with the other learners.This pushed me to work even harder as I hoped for a better life.

As I went into high school I then discovered my interest and I figured out that I wanted to be a medical doctor.At that time we had gained stability as a family as my mother had picked up some side hustles. Mother would always encourage me to work hard and that compelled me to greatness.In class I would always come second keeping in my mind my background and the goals I had set for myself.When I were in form four my mother passed on due to COVID-19.This broke me down to the extent that I never thought I would make it,I lost faith in my abilities.My mother was our pillar,she cartered for everything and yet she was gone.

My Uncle then took us in and sent me to school since I were in form four l till now  I have finished high school.My uncle and sister had to work day and night for them im to provide for the extended family.Now that I have to go to university my uncle and sister feels they  can nolonger fund my education as medicine study can be quite expensive since he still have other children that are in need  of his attention.

Looking from where I've came from I actually can't give up now on my dreams.What pushes me the most is the fact that I lost both of my parents due to lack of proper treatment because we didn't have money and I would really want to be a doctor one day and save lives.Even though my uncle can nolonger provide for me I still feel the zeal to pursue my goals despite that my situation is saying otherwise. 

That's why I have considered applying for a  scholarship hoping and entrusting that I get a favourable reply so that I ease off the burden for my uncle and sister <This message was edited>
