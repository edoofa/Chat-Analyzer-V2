*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
17/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Tapiwa Zizhou_EDOOFA(18/01)GS" to "Tapiwa Zizhou_EDOOFA(17/01)GS"
17/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Of course
17/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tapiwa,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
17/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Have been waiting for your response Mr Gurvinder. Looking forward to be talking to you. Thank you very much.
17/01/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tapiwa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Charlene, is that correct?
17/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Yes
17/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Charlene, also do tell me whether you learnt about Charlene’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
17/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 353 9111: Sorry for the late replies i am having network problems. Thank very for the question. So from what i heard, Edoofa  is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*, which believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. The  scholarship programmes are  based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to college, training and making them job ready. These were the experiences that i heard from Charlene.
17/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 6:35 pm - +263 71 353 9111: That's very true. That has been an opportunity that even my parents would want. Because even  while I was doing my Advanced Level, there were actually struggling with paying for my school fees. So of course this would even lessen financial burden to them.
17/01/24, 10:06 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
18/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
18/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 353 9111: Good Morning.
18/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Tapiwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 353 9111: Yes
18/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tapiwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

19/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 71 353 9111: It has always been my passion to study in medical sciences ever since I was a child. Due to the poor medical facilities and lack of doctors in my country, many people are dying every year because of that. So I feel if I feel like if I study medical sciences and become a doctor, I might also be able to help save lives.
19/01/24, 9:32 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.
