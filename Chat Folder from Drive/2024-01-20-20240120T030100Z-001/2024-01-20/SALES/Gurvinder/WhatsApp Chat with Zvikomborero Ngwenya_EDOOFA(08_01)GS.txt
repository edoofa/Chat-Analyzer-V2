What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I heard that edoofa is a scholarship program that offers from 50-100 percent scholarships to African students to study at prestigious universities in India. It also provides an opportunity for one  to work and learn at the same time. The money is earned in form of scholarship credits that can be deducted from your annual fee after the scholarship. It also provides webinars that makes one skilled for jobs and other. It also helps you get to know more internship opportunities.

Because I am a dedicated learner  and I am very passionate about learning new skills and languages that can  open new opportunities in my lfe.

In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
08/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 477 6334: I don't understand what you mean by the preliminary 6 questions
08/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Did Nyasha share any questions with you?
08/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 477 6334: I just filled the application form
08/01/24, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 477 6334: Yes
08/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
08/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 477 6334: I understand that it's a scholarship program that help international students to study in India doing their chosen programmes ..it offer scholarships on different percentages some including accommodation and some not ..
08/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
08/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Zvikomborero Ngwenya_EDOOFA(08/01)GS IE" to "Zvikomborero Ngwenya_EDOOFA(08/01)GS"
08/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 477 6334: Yes you are correct
08/01/24, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Zvikomborero, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 477 6334: Yes I do ..
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Gurvinder: Now Zvikomborero, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

10/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 477 6334: Good morning to you too sir
10/01/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
10/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 477 6334: Can you explain what it really is
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.

The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: The subjects included in B.com program are as following:

*Accountancy*
*Cost Account*
*Statistics*
*Management*
*Human Resource*

10/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 477 6334: Can you tell me the careers I can take
10/01/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
10/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 477 6334: Okay thank you
10/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
10/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 477 6334: I understand
10/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 477 6334: I think I did well in my final examinations
10/01/24, 11:19 am - Gurvinder: That is great, so did you understand the course?
10/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 477 6334: Yes I did ..if I pass with 12 points what can I  study besides a degree in commerce
10/01/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: Please as you shared that you want a career in Actuarial science, therefore, this is the course you should go ahead with.
10/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 477 6334: Thank you so what's next
10/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
10/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 477 6334: If I'm provided with this career course I see myself back here in Zimbabwe working for an insurance company called Old Mutual. I also see myself becoming one of the best actuarial scientists in Zimbabwe.Edoofa's program will be  the bridge that can help me pursue my dreams of becoming one of the nation's best since it will help me cover costs of tuition and accomodation. It will also enable me to get working experience through the online projects assigned to me . In conclusion I would really be grateful if I'm offered the opportunity.
10/01/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Zvikomborero I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
10/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I am really willing to give it my all
10/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I would like to explore a new environment..and also because when it comes to programs in Zimbabwe there are limited spaces usually they only take 15 points only for actuarial science ...
10/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
10/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I  would  adopt some of the strategies you use in your universities and use them here in Zimbabwe to apply them in career guidance conferences to help students who would be unsure of what they want to study and who feel limited to certain courses
10/01/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Zvikomborero, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
10/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I definitely agree
10/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
10/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Definitely
10/01/24, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
10/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

10/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now Zvikomborero, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
10/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 477 6334: No questions but I'm impressed , I pray I get the chance to study there
10/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
10/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 477 6334: No we are not
10/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Zvikomborero what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Wow that's really great
10/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
10/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Yes
10/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Zvikomborero, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
10/01/24, 4:42 pm - +263 77 477 6334: It definitely is interesting
10/01/24, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
10/01/24, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
10/01/24, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

10/01/24, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
10/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I definitely I agree that this will benefit me
10/01/24, 4:50 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Zvikomborero, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I understand
10/01/24, 4:52 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/01/24, 4:52 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/01/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 477 6334: It's what drove me to apply
10/01/24, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Zvikomborero, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
10/01/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Yes both my parents
10/01/24, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
10/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 477 6334: We have talked about it but not in depth
10/01/24, 5:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Yes I'm ready
10/01/24, 5:07 pm - Gurvinder: Zvikomborero as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/01/24, 5:08 pm - +263 77 477 6334: $1500-$2250
10/01/24, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Zvikomborero, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/01/24, 5:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 77 477 6334: So I have to pay $350
10/01/24, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
10/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Okay
10/01/24, 5:12 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 77 477 6334: So I'm guaranteed admission
10/01/24, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
10/01/24, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/01/24, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: Zvikomborero basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/01/24, 5:14 pm - +263 77 477 6334: Okay tt wld be lovely
10/01/24, 5:14 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
10/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 477 6334: So in what phase am I..
10/01/24, 5:17 pm - Gurvinder: let me explain.
10/01/24, 5:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
10/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 477 6334: No
10/01/24, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Zvikomborero, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
10/01/24, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/01/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 477 6334: I understand
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
10/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 77 477 6334: No
10/01/24, 5:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/01/24, 5:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/01/24, 5:21 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

The program helps the Learner to get experience  for his/her program while still a Learner. Earn While You Learn program is very good for both parents, Learner and the Tutor. The Tutor/Trainer will also assess the trainee's project or job noting which area is good and which area is weak during the program.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

Genocide refers to the systematic and intentional destruction of people based on their national ,ethnic,racial and religious identity. It was one of the most horrific examples of crime against humanity in Rwanda .The genocide resulted in more than eight hundred thousand people and it lasted for more than a hundred days. The main factors were political instability and ethnic tensions in the country.

Life in Rwanda has however changed 16 years later and the country has made significant progress in terms of human rights . There has also been commentable progress in terms of infrastructure and economic development .Overally , life in Rwanda is now different considering how it was during the genocide era due to the strides made by the Rwandan government in rebuilding the country .The introduction of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has resulted in the conviction of individuals who were responsible for the genocide . This has brought justice to many victims and provided a sense of security .Conclusively , life in Rwanda has improved and is now better than it was.

The Rwandan government has now built notable infrastructure like the Kigali Memorial Center so as to always remember the tragedy that fell on the country during the year of 1994.The country has also made progress in promoting peace and reconciliation .There have been a number of initiatives aimed at bringing together people from all backgrounds including the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission.The country now faces normal challenges like in any other country like poverty and corruption . Rwanda is now a safe country to reside in due to measures taken by the government 16 years after the genocide.

"My Inspirational Story

When I was a child , I used to look up to my mother .She was a working woman  at the same time a wife and a mother.She always used to be the pillar of strength I needed during my time at school or even anywhere .Her strength and resilience inspired me to be the best person I wanted to be .I always wanted to make her proud and to make her dreams come true .Her love and affection rubbed off on me and made me a better person in society .I passed my grade seven examinations and went to a boarding school full of determination. I strived to excel in whatever I do because whenever I failed I would think of her and how she would always tell me how God will always come through .I wanted to become a woman of valour.I  sat for my o levels and passed all the ten subjects I sat for .I then enrolled again at the same school to write my a levels in mathematics ,accounting and business enterprise skills and also did well.All this was a result of my mother's prayers and love since she supported me in all ways . She has been my inspiration and still is as I now pursue a degree in the career of my choice . I know she will also be there during this new chapter of my life.

16/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 433 1473: Good afternoon Sir.

I read the letter from the Director and I understand that as parents we must support our child emotionally and financially. I also understand that I must enquire from some parents with their kids studying at local universities noting down the challenges being faced. The challenges might include fee hikes or employability after graduation. I noted that as parents we must financially plan together to ensure full preparedness of our child's education. I also happy that I'm free to share with my Counselor in case l encounter some challenges in line with my child's education. Surely the Earn While You Learn program is very good for the parent and the child as stated in the letter. I really like Edoofa Scholarship program, mainly because  it does not offer theoretical knowledge which is offered in other universities but Edoofa produces an employable child after skill development and practical training. I also understand that failing to meet the enrollment deadline will attract a USD$500 penalty for reapplication. I wish my child the best through Edoofa Scholarship program.
16/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now moving on, you have to appear for the last evaluation criteria of the Edoofa Scholarship Program which is a Video Call with the Program Director, *In which you will have to participate.*

16/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 433 1473: May you clarify whether both parents and the child will be participating in the video call or I alone such that I can give a good answer
16/01/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: Please you and the student should both participate.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

19/01/24, 12:10 am - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

19/01/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Are we connected or not?
19/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 433 1473: Hallo
19/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Are you available now?
19/01/24, 10:01 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
