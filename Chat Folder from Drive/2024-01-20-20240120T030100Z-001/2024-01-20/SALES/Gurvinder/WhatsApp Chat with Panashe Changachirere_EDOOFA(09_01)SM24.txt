11/01/24, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
11/01/24, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Thats nice. I like it especially the part about SEELS
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

12/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 827 6990: I am 20 years old and l live in Mutare Zimbabwe. My mother has been the one supporting me in my education since O level. She is a single mother. She is a Primary School teacher. Her highest educational level is O level. She is the one who will be supporting me financially abroad for my higher education. I have a little brother and he recently started high school. He is a form one student. My highest education level is A Level & l did my A level at St Dominics High School in Mutare from 2021 - 2022. My fees per term was $130. I would like to practise a medicine course there. I have an interest in becoming a doctor when l grow up, that is what l have always aspired to be ever since l was young.

12/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 827 6990: My previous school had the best reputation in the city in terms of good behaviour and best results. It focused on holistic education, with a curriculum that incorporated both academic and personal growth. I participated in extracurricular activities like the school's quiz team, choir, athletics, soccer, basketball and volunteer programs. These activities helped me develop my skills in critical thinking, teamwork and communication. The holistic education I received also taught me the importance of self-reflection and introspection. I learned to be mindful of my thoughts and actions, and to consider how they affect others. This has helped me become more compassionate and understanding of people from different backgrounds and perspective
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

This drove my interest in medicine because l have a desire to help people especially in my country. 
Plus l have always been fascinated by the human body and how it works and l want to use my knowledge and skills to improve people's health.
I want to be able to make a difference in the lives of patients and their families and l believe medicine is the key to that

Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.

They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

15/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 827 6990: That is amazing and interesting
15/01/24, 11:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
15/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Because l want to increase my future employment opportunities globally. I also want to gain new experiences and learn new cultures. I want to develop independence and self-reliance. I also want to make connections with people from all over the world so as to develop future career opportunities and friendships
15/01/24, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
15/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 827 6990: No l haven't
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
15/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 827 6990: I think its around US$1200 per year <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 827 6990: So after how many semesters will l will be able  to start the earn while you learn program
15/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Shall I brief you about the same
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 827 6990: Good morning
17/01/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
17/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 827 6990: That would be great
17/01/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Panashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Ok so will l be able to join the EWYL program in my 1st semester
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Please you will start the EWYL program just after you enroll with the EDOOFA Scholarship program.
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

17/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
17/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes it shows great potential. I think this will benefit me a lot
17/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Panashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 827 6990: That is very beneficial. I get it now about the wholeEWYL program
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
17/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes it is. Your scholarship scheme is unoque
17/01/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Panashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
17/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes my mother
17/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes l have
17/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/01/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes
17/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Panashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 827 6990: $1500-$2250
17/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Panashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/01/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Ok so when can l enroll
17/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Let me explain
17/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Panashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Ok l get it. So where can l pay this reservation fee
17/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Let me explain.
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 827 6990: No lm not
17/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Panashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
17/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Yes l have understood the process
17/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
17/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/01/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 827 6990: So my accomodation fee is included the annual fee right
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
17/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Ok got it
17/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
17/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
17/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 827 6990: Ok will try to notify them, they are not close they are off at work
18/01/24, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Hello @263778276990 @263773668687 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
18/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 827 6990: Yes we are
18/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Are your parents active?
19/01/24, 12:15 am - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
19/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
19/01/24, 10:02 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
