08/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Privilege, Mr and Mrs Sivangani!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Hello
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Privilege,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 087 1669: I'm so glad we're are chatting and l always happy to talk about the Edoofa scholarship program
08/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Privilege, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Abraham, is that correct?
08/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Yes thus true
08/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Abraham, also do tell me whether you learnt about Abraham’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 087 1669: He didn't tell me much cause he said yu are going to tell me
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Yes it is
08/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Privilege, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Yes l think l have okay what do you really consider to a student
08/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now Privilege, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
08/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Okay _ 
I will start by the level of education right cause you already know my name
_ for now A level is my highest level of education 
I wrote my A level last year that is 2023 and we are now waiting for the results and we are expecting them on Friday that's the 12 th of January
_ my wish is to study accounting cause l think is the best cause for me and for the economy of our country ( Zimbabwe) As a woman l want to become a chartered accountant 
_ I thank God that l have both of my parents alive but only one of them go to work my mom is just a housewife and Father is a Wilder in Triangle 
_ my mom wrote ZJC that is form two now and my father only end at grade seven bcz their parents were financially unstable and they were 12 children in their family 
_ so my father was supporting me in my education with the aim that one day l will take care of them 
_ he is the one who is going to support me for my further education though he is no financially stable 
_ yes l have siblings but l'm the first born in a family of four children the second one is doing A level , the other is doing form one and the last one is doing grade five
I was studying at Mufakose secondary School in Triangle in Masvingo province
And my pre term fee was $15 because l was learning under company support which is Tongaat Hulett
08/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: And may I know, what is the per term fee without the company support?
08/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 087 1669: It was  $75
08/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Privilege.
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now, you mentioned you have an younger siblling in A-level and a two younger siblings also in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, where there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
08/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Nice so what does EDOOFA stands for
08/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Yes they face a big challenge
08/01/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, what were your plans for higher education, before knowing about Edoofa?
08/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 087 1669: I was thinking of getting  part time jobs to support them in raising my fee for higher education
08/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me share with you that Edoofa grants a scholarship of 50%-100%, generally that brings the cost of education around $2000-3000 per year, though I feel that you are genuine candidate for this program so I can recommend you for higher quantum as well which will bring that to $1500-$2300 per year, so do you think your parents can support you for that or anyone in the family that might help you for that?
08/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Yeah l think they can
08/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
08/01/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study accounting, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
08/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Well, I'm glad you asked! My interest in accounting stems from the fact that it is such a foundational and versatile field. Accounting touches every aspect of a business, from finance to operations to human resources. I find it fascinating how the numbers tell a story about the health and success of a business. Plus, accountants are often viewed as trusted advisors who can provide valuable insights into the inner workings of an organization. And, since accounting is such a dynamic field, there are always new and interesting challenges to tackle. So, I feel that studying accounting would be both intellectually stimulating and professionally rewarding.
08/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: That's an impressive perspective! Studying accounting indeed opens doors to understanding the intricate details that drive businesses forward. The ability to decipher the language of numbers and translate it into actionable insights is invaluable.
08/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
08/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 087 1669: No l'm the first
08/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 087 1669: I have chosen to persue a career in accounting because l have been studying business at A level
08/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
08/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Okay fine
08/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 087 1669: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 087 1669: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
08/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Okay thank you
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/01/24, 9:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 10:20 pm - +263 78 087 1669: I really appreciate your words of encouragement and l completely agree
08/01/24, 10:21 pm - +263 78 087 1669: It's okay 
same applies to you sir

16/01/24, 7:41 pm - +263 78 087 1669: Oh no, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience and delay in my reply. I really appreciate you reaching out to me and checking in. My lack of response was due to an unexpected technical glitch, but I'm back online and ready to resume our conversation. I am really grateful for your interest in helping me pursue my higher education goals. I am very excited to learn more about the opportunities that are available through your program. Thank you so much for your understanding and patience. I can't wait to get started! 😊

17/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 087 1669: That's a really interesting question. I believe that by studying abroad, I will not only gain a wealth of knowledge and skills, but also a new perspective on life and education. I plan to use this experience to develop new and innovative methods of teaching and learning that can be applied in my home country. I will also work towards building stronger connections and partnerships between the educational institutions in my home country and those abroad, to share knowledge and best practices. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to the development of a more robust and effective education system in my country that prepares students for the global economy.
17/01/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Privilege, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
17/01/24, 9:50 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

Can I ask what kind of environment you think is most conducive to learning and developing one's skills?

18/01/24, 11:42 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
