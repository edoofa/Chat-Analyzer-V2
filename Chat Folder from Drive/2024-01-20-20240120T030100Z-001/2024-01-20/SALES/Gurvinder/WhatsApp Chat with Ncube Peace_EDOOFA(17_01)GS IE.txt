India offers one of the best education specially in the medical field so medicine ,Radiography or pharmacy will obviously be good options for me and I also think my love for Biology will Influence the passion of undergoing these courses
17/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, if Agatha asked you any more questions?
17/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Agatha then explained to me about the Edoofa scholarship program, and she gave me a chance to ask few questions about what I don't understand, which I did and she explained to me and cleared  all my confusions

17/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Thank you
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So let me brief you more.
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Yes, please Iam looking forward to the opportunity to be independent, further my studies for higher education and I feel it really reduces the burden on my parents
17/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Peace, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I have faith in my self, I do have what it takes to meet these two important matrices and try to get a higher quantum of scholarship
17/01/24, 10:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
17/01/24, 10:14 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Thank you Mr Gurvinder I appreciate the conversation we had today and I'm looking forward to continue with it tomorrow

In Zimbabwe our medical facilities are poor and according to my research they are few Radiographers hence people have to go outside the country to try access these facilities which is expensive. So I wish to study this course in Radiography and open some centres that are cheap and accessible and also work hand in hand with hospitals as an helping hand In my country especially  in my town.

19/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: I'd like to share insights into why choosing a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) could be the key to unlocking exciting opportunities, especially if your dream involves establishing and running labs in our country.

1. Comprehensive Understanding of Diagnostic Processes:

B.Sc. MLT provides a holistic understanding of diagnostic procedures, covering various aspects of laboratory testing. From hematology to clinical chemistry, you'll gain expertise in diverse areas crucial for accurate diagnostics.
2. Versatility in Lab Operations:

MLT equips you with a versatile skill set, making you proficient in handling a wide range of laboratory tests. This versatility is invaluable when setting up a lab as it allows you to offer a comprehensive suite of diagnostic services.
3. Entrepreneurial Edge:

Aspiring to open labs requires more than technical know-how; it demands an entrepreneurial edge. MLT not only imparts technical skills but also nurtures a mindset to manage and grow a successful laboratory business.
4. Meeting Local Healthcare Needs:

Labs are fundamental to healthcare, and by specializing in MLT, you'll be contributing directly to meeting local healthcare needs. Understanding the specific health challenges in our country will enable you to tailor your services accordingly.
5. Adaptable to Emerging Trends:

The field of MLT is dynamic and evolves with advancements in medical technology. Your education will keep you abreast of the latest trends, ensuring that your labs stay at the forefront of diagnostic innovation.
6. Community Impact:

Opening labs isn't just a business venture; it's a chance to make a real impact on the health and well-being of our community. MLT allows you to play a vital role in disease prevention, early detection, and overall healthcare improvement.
In conclusion, B.Sc. MLT isn't just a degree; it's a strategic investment in a future where you become a pioneer in diagnostic services, contributing significantly to the health and prosperity of our nation. I encourage you to consider the myriad possibilities MLT offers and envision the positive change you can bring to our healthcare landscape.
19/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 137 2401: Now I am really considering my choice,because after your insight on MLT I feel as if it will offer me a better chance of achieving my goal compared to Radiography which will just only limit some of my aspirations.
19/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 77 137 2401: I will be thinking about considering my options and including MLT as one of my options if possible
19/01/24, 9:31 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
