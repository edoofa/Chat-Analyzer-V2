*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
17/01/24, 2:21 pm - +260 97 1421347: Thank you so much Sir.
Indeed you have contacted the right person.
17/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chimuka,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
17/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Chimuka Simulilika_EDOOFA(15/01)GS" to "Chimuka Simulilika_EDOOFA(17/01)GS"
17/01/24, 2:25 pm - +260 97 1421347: The pleasure is mine, I am looking forward to the discussions.
17/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Chimuka, May I know, what do you already know about the program?
17/01/24, 2:55 pm - +260 97 1421347: What I already know about Edoofa program is that it provides training services and scholarships to scholars possessing the ability to the current global problems and also exposes them to industrial experience to sharpen their skills.
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
17/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
17/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/01/24, 3:11 pm - +260 97 1421347: Yes that's right.
17/01/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chimuka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/01/24, 3:24 pm - +260 97 1421347: Yes I do
17/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chimuka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
17/01/24, 3:41 pm - +260 97 1421347: I hold a bachelor of science degree in Biochemistry and I intend to pursue a Master of science degree in Biochemistry.  I was raised by my mother who is a primary school teacher having attained a diploma in education as her highest education level. My education was supported by my mother and two of her sisters. Once selected for the scholarship, I will have to work after school hours to be able to pay what will need to be paid by myself together with what my mother can help with. 
I have two siblings, one has just started pursuing her diploma and the other one is still in primary school. I attended Choma secondary school for my secondary education and by then we would pay K900 per term. For my undergraduate I attended Bugema University in Uganda and we paid $600 tuition fee per semester.
17/01/24, 10:01 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
17/01/24, 10:02 pm - +260 97 1421347: Alright, thank you.
18/01/24, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
18/01/24, 11:41 am - +260 97 1421347: That's true
18/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Chimuka.
18/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, what motivates you behind pursuing Masters in Biochemistry?
18/01/24, 12:54 pm - +260 97 1421347: Thank you so much for that question.
The single fact that Biochemistry explores chemical processes in living organisms makes me curious in wanting to understand more about those processes. So far i have leant about the various chemical processes in living organisms and I discovered that alot of products that may improve life can be generated from the said biochemical processes. 
Furthering my studies will give me a deeper understanding and open doors for to be able to put some of the said biochemical processes into bettering life for example insulin production can be improved, tromgr antibiotics can be produced, the climate can be protected and many other things. All this motivates me in knowing more about these processes through the intended master degree.
Once awarded the 100 percent scholarship, you will be equipping the next problem solver in the medical and bioengineering sectors.
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: cIt's clear that you have a deep interest in the potential applications of biochemistry in improving and advancing various aspects of life. Your desire to contribute to fields like medical and bioengineering by gaining a deeper understanding through a Master's in Biochemistry is commendable.
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: So can you share your Grade 12 results and Bachelor's transcripts?
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 1421347: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 1421347: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 1421347: <Media omitted>
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, I am sending your results and transcripts to the Academic board for evaluation.
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 1421347: Alright.
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now I want to know, as I told you that this is a 50-100% scholarship, even after that the cost of education comes down to $2000-3000 per year, and you have written that you will work after University hours to support this education but unfortunately that is not allowed in India, so may I know, what are your plans to support your education?
18/01/24, 1:44 pm - +260 97 1421347: Honestly I don't have any other way other than getting a part time job. If at all the school I will go to can hire me as a part time tutor or laboratory technician it would help me so much.
18/01/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, will get back to you after evaluation of your scripts has been done.
18/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 97 1421347: Alright, thank you.
18/01/24, 11:51 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

19/01/24, 9:21 am - +260 97 1421347: Thank you.
19/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: So I would like to tell you that after talking to the academic board, I want to share that working a part time job at a school or University is not possible as Indian Laws make that not possible, so may I know, if you have any other source to finance your education?
19/01/24, 10:50 am - +260 97 1421347: Unfortunately I don't have any other ways.
19/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: So you do not want to continue?
19/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 97 1421347: I do want to continue
19/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: So for that you would have to find a solution to arrange that $2000-3000 annually, so may I ask if you have any sibling or family member that is willing to support you for your Master's?
19/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 1421347: I can try and find
19/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please find a solution for that, so that we can proceed ahead with the application.
