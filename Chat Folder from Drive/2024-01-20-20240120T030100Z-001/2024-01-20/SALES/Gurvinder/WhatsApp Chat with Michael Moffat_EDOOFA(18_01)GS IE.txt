The importance of exploring multi cultures

It is significant because students who learn about different cultures and societies during their education feel comfortable and safe with these differences later in life be it at work or home. This gives them a wider room to interact in social groups and feel more confident and belief in themselves as well as interaction with others.
18/01/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: So now can you address this question?
18/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 321 1883: Olk he said that it ranges from 50-100% depending on your performance
18/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Michael, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
18/01/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
18/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 71 321 1883: No l don't have any limitations
18/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 627 7197: As Michael’s parent I don’t have any limitations
18/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now Michael, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
