19/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Keke Muke!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
19/01/24, 9:56 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
