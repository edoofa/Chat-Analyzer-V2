*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
09/01/24, 8:37 am - +263 78 837 6846: How are you Mr Gurvinder?

Yes you have contacted the right person Sir

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 78 837 6846: Okay Mr  Gurvinder . Thank you for informing me.
09/01/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Eutria, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tariro , is that correct?
09/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes Sir that is correct.
10/01/24, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*Excuse me for yesterday, I was under the weather and had a bad fever.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
10/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 837 6846: Good morning Sir. How are you today?
10/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 837 6846: We will  participate together but here, our network connection is a bit poor.
10/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tariro, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tariro’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay, I have come to know that EDOOFA is a Scholarship program that  helps students to  fulfil their Higher education in India and it covers from 50% to 100% tuition fees. And it offers all programs considering your qualifications , and one will also be assisted in choosing the best program. EDOOFA also offers assistance in the admission process and choosing the right university.
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes we are actually looking for such a beautiful offer because of financial difficulties.
10/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Eutria, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes.
10/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now Eutria, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
10/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 837 6846: ▫️Okay, I completed my Advanced level   in 2022 at Mwenezi government  Hig School which is In Zimbabwe Masvingo Province and I was enrolled is a science class studying mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. 

▫️ I I'm more interested in Health sciences and I would like to study medicine.

▫️I stay with both of  my parents. My mother is not employed and and my father is self employed that is he used to sell small gargets and garments in South Africa for our living.
▫️My parents didn't acquire higher education, my mother didn't get the chance to reach for the Ordinary level and my father just completed his ordinary level and failed to proceed to the next level. 
▫️My father has been funding for my education and now he is still trying to save for my higher education but it is difficult.
▫️We are four in our family and I'm the eldest child. My youngsters are    still proceeding with their studies, one of them is sitting for her Ordinary level exams this year and others are in primary school
▫️During my A level course, I was studying at Mwenezi Government Hig School in Masvingo Province. I was paying $75 per term.
10/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 837 6846: I was supposed to start my Tertiary education in 2023 but I am still failing to cover most of the expenses.
10/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Eutria.
10/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
10/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 837 6846: I'm interested in medicine because it offers a variety of careers and also I will get to know more about scientific facts, the evolution in medical fields and also finding new cures for deadly diseases. I also get the opportunity to help the community by reducing pain and suffering. It is always my wish to give back to community.
10/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
10/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 837 6846: No, actually I want to be first in my family.
10/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
10/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay, in PDFs right?
10/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 837 6846: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 837 6846: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Eutria, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
10/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
10/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand
10/01/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 837 6846: So without physics, I am not able to persue any the programs you stated?
10/01/24, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: These are the courses that you can pursue except Optometry.
10/01/24, 5:10 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay noted
10/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 78 837 6846: So I think I will go for physiotherapy.
10/01/24, 9:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
11/01/24, 5:57 am - +263 78 837 6846: Good morning Sir
11/01/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/01/24, 8:04 am - +263 78 837 6846: Hwo are you Sir
11/01/24, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
11/01/24, 8:05 am - +263 78 837 6846: I am fine sir.
11/01/24, 8:06 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
11/01/24, 8:06 am - +263 78 837 6846: Yes sir
11/01/24, 8:07 am - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
11/01/24, 8:07 am - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
11/01/24, 8:07 am - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
11/01/24, 8:10 am - +263 78 837 6846: Okay that's quite impressive.
Can you please explain further about what you call clinical internship.
11/01/24, 8:11 am - Gurvinder: Please, in the last year of the course, clinics or hospitals come to the University to select you for 6 months of internships for practical working experience. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 8:15 am - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand
11/01/24, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
11/01/24, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/01/24, 8:18 am - +263 78 837 6846: According to the requirements you stated, I'm confident that I can achieve it.
11/01/24, 8:27 am - Gurvinder: That is great, so did you understand the course?
11/01/24, 8:33 am - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I do, and I will get to know more about the course through researches
11/01/24, 8:34 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/01/24, 9:07 am - +263 78 837 6846: If I get the opportunity to complete this course, I will be someone to gain professional recognition because as a physiotherapist, I will be able to enhance people's general health by using extensive knowledge of the field. Also with experience, I can develop problem solving skills by identifying the reasons for suffering in patients because there could be several explanations for the illness. After completing the course, I will have many job opportunities since physiotherapy is an in-demand profession in hospitals, clinics and in nursing homes and  besides, I will improve my knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the human being. Due to the developing technology, I will have the opportunity to access the equipment and all the technological advances in physiotherapy. Through the assistance of the EDOOFA's program, I will be able to achieve my dreams because I will get an aid to cover the expenses that are needed to complete the course. Since EDOOFA offers training to students for betters skills in all careers, this will be a privilege to me by increasing job market world wide.
11/01/24, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Eutria I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/01/24, 9:20 am - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I'm willing to take any opportunity Sir.
11/01/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 837 6846: I want to study abroad because there is better quality education and also advanced technology which enables students to do wider research. There is also a diversity in courses offered.
11/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 837 6846: Okay as an individual if I get the opportunity to study abroad, I will gain exposure to technologies, scientific advancement and research methodologies. I can tranfer this knowledge and skills to my home country contributing to the advancement of various educational sectors
11/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Eutria, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I do
11/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Actually I was not aware about the Indian history.
11/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
11/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.
11/01/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Let's explore how Indian graduates have impacted the world! 🌍

11/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 837 6846: This is quite  impressive.
11/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now Eutria, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
11/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I have understood. I think now you can tell me about the admission process.
11/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
11/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes someone told me that it ranges from $3000 to $6000 per year for undergraduate students
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay so that will be depending on the course right
11/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: I have given you the cost depending on the course.
11/01/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
11/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
11/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Eutria, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay, So the scholarship credit will contribute to expenses that must be covered
11/01/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: The scholarship credits can be used to pay off the University fees.
11/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand
11/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
11/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

11/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
11/01/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
11/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Eutria, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes this is very clear
11/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I have looking forward such opportunities
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Eutria, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
11/01/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/01/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
11/01/24, 2:40 pm - +27 71 995 6221: Good afternoon  sir ,i am Eutria's father
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - +27 71 995 6221: I will be very happy if you mange to help my daughter  to reach her dreams
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mr Mapfumo, may I know have you been following the session?
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - +27 71 995 6221: Yes sir
11/01/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now Mr Mapfumo as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 2:44 pm - +27 71 995 6221: I am ready  sir
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mapfumo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 837 6846: So that will be equivalent to $1500 to $2250 for applications only
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 837 6846: If I may ask, is this application fee refundable?
11/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Eutria, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay this is affordable
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay so for the application, one should pay only $350
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - +27 71 995 6221: We dont have a problem  about  paying  that amount  sir what i want is a real thing only
11/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Please, do not worry about that, we are associated with over 200 schools in ZImbabwe.
11/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay so the chances for one to get a Scholarship is how many percent.
11/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Because I can see that due to the high numbers of students applying, the competition is very tight.
11/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: As I said before, if you are found eligible for the program and you enrol with the program, then you are guaranteed an admission and scholarship.
11/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand
11/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Eutria basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay sir
11/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 837 6846: No
11/01/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Eutria, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Yes I understand
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 837 6846: I don't have any question
11/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 837 6846: Okay
11/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

SECTION 5
 Genocide survivors and those who participated in the genocide showed high rates of mental health and psychological problems due to being dehumanised brutality that the majority of them had been exposed to. A great majority of the survivors were female and woman headed households proved to be especially vulnerable suffering from the effects of economic deprivation which included a lack of food, housing and money for the education of their children. Today Rwanda has rebuilt itself in the aftermath of that tragedy, setting itself apart from other developing nations by efficiently and transparently making the most of other nation's investments and creating success in agriculture and social services as well as basic infrastructure. Access to electricity and running water for those who could pay for it, is being constantly improved. Against this impressive backdrop, crushing poverty still affects about 45 percent of the population. Millions are living in tiny plots of land scarcely capable of producing adequate food for their families and average woman gives birth to five children promoting rapid population growth. In response the government has embarked on an ambitious program to promote family planning but the population growth will take years to slow. The government is trying to build more restaurants, universities, technical schools and preschools  for better living conditions. Due to rapid population growth the children continue to be malnourished and educational facilities are inadequate for living children. Rwanda has will continue to develop and meets its destiny by improving productivity in farms, better health care and thousands of more primary school classrooms. Rwanda intends to be on par with Brazil, Thailand and other Nations so as to pull itself out of poverty. The  nation is also improving their infrastructure which includes the building of roads at resort centres and it is struggling to get tourists to Visit Rwanda's mountain gorillas. With the help of other nations, lives of the citizens of Rwanda is improving, clearing all the burdens that were created by the genocide where people were used to be attacked and killed with grenades.

SECTION 6

Someone said that life always throws challenges on but the key to life is accepting challenges. I personally I have grown in a family where we struggle to get food, to get clot3, shelter and also afford for my education. I  am going to inspire you about the importance of going to school. When I was twelve years, I once experienced a sorrowful moment where my uncle was against us and he destroyed our own home and by that time we were left with nothing. I was in primary school and my father was out looking, working to earn a little so that he can feed us as a family. My mother is not employed and she could not afford to buy any school necessities and the burden is only on my father's shoulders.When our home was destroyed, my education was disturbed and besides I was young but I was also mentally disturbed. Considering the situation, my all hope was almost gone that I was not even able to imagine myself completing my secondary education. By that time my mother was pregnant with  the last born in our family and her health begin to fall and there is nothing  that torture us as children more than seeing your parent suffering.

My father tried to find a place for us to stay and fortunately he find one but I wasn't going to school for a whole month because of financial instabilities. Every challenge and misfortune during your school time will only make you a better and stronger person so from there I gathered confidence that once I get an opportunity to go to school I'm going to make it. After a month of staying at home, we also moved to a new province and we had a police report that all our belongings were burnt so the administrator at a nearby school accepted me. During the first days, I was a little bit weak on school work but with the help of my teacher who know my background, I managed to complete my primary level and I passed my grade seven with quality results.
In 2017 that is when I applied for a vacancy to start my secondary education and school fees was a higher than the amount we used to pay when I was in primary. In our educational sectors of primary and secondary education, those who didn't pay their school fees in full are send back home till their fees is fully paid, so on my side my studies were disturbed because sometimes my father may fail to pay the fees in time but what I managed is to stay focused and study hard. By staying motivated and having perseverance you can achieve any goal in your life. I worked harder and with the help of my parents who Always encouraged me, I managed to seat for my ordinary level exams, though it was difficult for them to provide for my exam fee.
As an individual you can play the game but as a team you can win championships so I also inspire parents to always provide a shoulder to lean on for their children when there are obstacles in their education times. It may seem  impossible to dream big or aim for higher goals when facing challenges but it is never too late to get back up again.

After completing my Ordinary level the next year I was  able to continue with advanced level studies and things were always tough for me but I managed to work with my teachers so as to achieve better grades. I'm currently excited that though I have not reached my final goal yet, I covered the greater part of the journey and now I have to make a final step for greater a  achievement.
