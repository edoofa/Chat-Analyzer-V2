I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:45 am - +260 96 4289255: Good morning sir 
Edoofa is a scholarship program which solve affordability and employment problems. With the edoofa program, you get to earn scholarships and job skills in India. It aims at providing educational opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students around the world
12/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 95 5928222: Good morning.
On my side I don't have any knowledge about Edoofa
12/01/24, 9:19 am - +260 95 5928222: Kindly if you can clarify and highlight more concerning the program
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Please, let me brief you more about the program.
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13/01/24, 7:53 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 8:22 am - +260 96 4289255: Noted
13/01/24, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
13/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 96 4289255: Yes sir
13/01/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Mwenya, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
13/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

16/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Mwenya, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: For these reasons, I cannot offer her a course in health sector, but I can definitely in Commercials.
16/01/24, 10:02 am - +260 96 4289255: Ok
16/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: So as you mentioned that she is also interested in accounts, so should I offer her a course in that field?

16/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: As a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Ficeya, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

16/01/24, 2:16 pm - +260 96 4289255: She will put all her efforts am sure
16/01/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that she is willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want her to study abroad and not in your country?
16/01/24, 2:28 pm - +260 96 4289255: Access to better form of education  ,experience different culture and appreciating  challenge of living in another country. The list is countless
16/01/24, 2:29 pm - +260 96 4289255: Endless ☝️
16/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/01/24, 2:44 pm - +260 96 4289255: Well firstly, I would encourage people to take a chance to study abroad because of the good opportunities that people like you offer and I would also like to help those who are not able to afford fees for education
16/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ficeya, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
16/01/24, 2:53 pm - +260 96 4289255: Yes I do
16/01/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
