Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/01/24, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I have always had a passion in the health sector,my dream is to be pharmacist and a lab technician. This comes from my desire to help make  the world a better place for everyone despite different social classes, by working towards administration of medical aid to all. I always embrace learning and exploring different trades because I believe learning and education is a life time process which goes beyond having a certificate.My highest level of education is Advanced level. I studied literature in English, History and Family Religious Studies and had 12points .My mother is a hairdresser by profession and her highest level of education is Ordinary level.My mother and my relatives have been supportive in my journey of education and they will be supporting me financially for my higher education abroad as well.

12/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 134 5675: I have always had  this passion in helping people in various ways and having a positive impact in people's lives . For the past few years we have experienced anumber of pandemic like coronavirus and Ebola which took many precious lives .To me those hard experiences drew me closer to wanting to explore more on how we can find cure or even prevention from such infections.Also during my Olevel I lost a friend due to blood pressure and diabetes which only came to light after she was already no more ,it made me more interested in wanting to know what happenes to the human body , how does one get such diseases, what needs to be done to avoid it and how to go about checking on your health, getting tested and getting treated.Also my father there some  diseases which later came to light after his passing on which he was never tested or get any treatment.Thus these are among other cases which drew me to wanting to be a lab technician running tests and trying to find cure to various infection and as for me I believe it works hand in hand with being a pharmacist.  When I think of me as a pharmacist I see myself opening many medicine and medical aid outlets across the globe with everyone being able to get treatment and assistance at the lowest cost .it's just my desire to provide medical assistance and treatment to all

It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

17/01/24, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 134 5675: Good morning
17/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 134 5675: Sure thank you
17/01/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
17/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 134 5675: No were
17/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 134 5675: No we're not familiar 
I had asked for assistance there
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Thank you 
I do understand
17/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Earn while you learn program makes it more easier financial
17/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: @263771345675 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Perfectly explained thank you 
It is really a good program which I would really like to take part in
17/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
17/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

17/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
17/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Yes I think this will benefit me
17/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263771345675 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Okay it really makes education affordable I'm glad
17/01/24, 10:11 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

18/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 134 5675: This is exactly what I have been looking for. I will be delighted to embark on such a journey for my international education
18/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263771345675 , now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Yes they are
18/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
18/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Yes I have and they are very supportive
19/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
19/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Good morning
I'm here for the discussion
19/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Yes I'm ready
19/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: @263771345675 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 134 5675: It will be about $1500-$2250
