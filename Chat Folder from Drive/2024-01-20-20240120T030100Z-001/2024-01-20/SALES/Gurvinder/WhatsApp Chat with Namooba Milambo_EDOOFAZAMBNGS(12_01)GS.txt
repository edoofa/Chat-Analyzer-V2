I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:19 am - Gurvinder added +260 97 9527180
12/01/24, 9:10 am - +260 96 8927757: Good morning sir 


I know that the edoofa scholarship helps us Africans to have an opportunity to study in India and it also helps with providing a 50% scholarship for those that qualify for the edoofa program
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 9:45 am - +260 97 9527180: Thank you so much for the detailed information on what the program is all about. We appreciate that our daughter is one of the considered student for the program. We are so excited about it
12/01/24, 9:50 am - +260 96 8927757: When one is doing the work while you earn , does it distract the pupils from there studies or like may it disturb the students from there studies?

When picking people to be part of the edoofa program do results also help you secure your seat in the edoofa program ?
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +260 96 8927757: Thank you for the information 
I know have a broad understanding of the program
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Please do not worry about that, I will explain you everything ahead in the counselling session.
12/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 96 8927757: Alright 
Thank you
12/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Namooba, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes
12/01/24, 12:04 pm - +260 96 8927757: I have what it takes

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

If I am accepted in the edoofa program it can give me a chance to study in India and be exposed to a greater variety of information and technology , knowing that most people with servier heart diseases go abroad to be treated , it can be a great achievement if I can study the course abroad and help my fellow Zambians from having the trouble to go abroad and just to add on the technology in India is better for teaching such courses and me qualifying for this program can help me achieve a lot in life .
15/01/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Namooba I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 96 8927757: Thank you so much 
And yes I am willing to put my 200% and I know that it does need a lot of hard work and I am determined to make my dreams a reality and to be a role model for my young brothers.
Nothing is going to distract me from my dreams and ambitions.
15/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 12:49 pm - +260 96 8927757: I would love to study abroad because there is better technology abroad and it can widen my thinking and help me see different aspects of which I am not aware of and also the exchange of cultures and to just see the world as it is
15/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/01/24, 1:06 pm - +260 96 8927757: Well, if I pursue my higher education through this scholarship , I can go and educate others about the wonders of the scholarship and probably introduce some of the learning techniques that are there abroad and from my experience I can suggest ways of helping develop the education system in my country
15/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Namooba, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/01/24, 1:16 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes I do agree with you ,
If I do study abroad and when I come back it can help me get to great hights and with the experience I might have I can educate schools about the program and how it helped me 
And with just experience I can manage to make a big difference in my country
15/01/24, 1:18 pm - +260 96 8927757: And just having the dedication and ambitions to do something one can reach great hights
15/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 1:26 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes
15/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/01/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/01/24, 2:36 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay 
I now understand 
Thank you so much for the information
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - +260 96 8927757: While the earn while you learn program how does it work actually
15/01/24, 2:40 pm - +260 96 8927757: How does it increases the percentage of the scholarship
15/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Namooba, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay 
I now understand what it is about thank you
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes I actually yo think it will benefit me , based on your explanation it can help expand my thinking and help me with a lot
15/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 96 8927757: And when one is in the EWYL program does one have to choose or you choose for them
15/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Namooba, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 3:47 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay 
I now understand properly thank you
15/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 3:53 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes it is 
This is a very nice program actually
15/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Namooba, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/01/24, 3:58 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes they are
15/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 96 8927757: I have discussed it with my mother and she had said that the best way for me to study abroad was if we manage to find a scholarship because they can not manage to pay for my education abroad fully
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 4:03 pm - +260 96 8927757: I am ready but I am traveling making the network quite poor
15/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
15/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Namooba as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 4:08 pm - +260 96 8927757: That will be about $1,500-  $2,250
15/01/24, 4:08 pm - +260 96 8927757: The cost is very high actually
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Namooba, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:13 pm - +260 96 8927757: So the enrollment fee is $750 or $350?
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please we have reduced it to $350.
15/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 4:15 pm - +260 96 8927757: So after paying for the enrollment fee that means that I am part of the program?
15/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Let us be patient, I will explain you everything ahead.
15/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
15/01/24, 4:16 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes I do
15/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/01/24, 4:20 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay I understand now 
So the EWYL program classes take place online ?
15/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
15/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 4:21 pm - +260 96 8927757: No I am not
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Namooba, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself. <This message was edited>
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay I understand
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - +260 96 8927757: No 
I have no questions as for now
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: *@260979527180*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
16/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Namooba* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
16/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Namooba’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
16/01/24, 1:05 pm - +260 97 9527180: Thank you, all is clear and understood
16/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *22nd or 23rd of January 2024* for $200 and the *22nd or 23rd of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *22nd or 23rd of January 2024*
Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
16/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 95 5140326: I don't see any need to pay money when my daughter has not received her results.  Its very strange that a schoolership can be awarded to someone without results. How then can the parents be guaranteed that the money they paid will be refunded should the child fail?
16/01/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Milambo, we are affiliated with your child's school, even if the child fails to pass our eligibility criteria, then the enrollment fee is refunded, which is already taken after we check the eligibility ourselves through the test and the interview, it really appears like you do not trust the scholarship program, but I assure you that parents of students from your child's school only have personally told me that they want to be the ambassadors of the program today.
16/01/24, 2:04 pm - +260 96 8927757: How long does the eligibility test and interviews take for you to see whether one is eligible
16/01/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that will take us one to two days.
16/01/24, 2:14 pm - +260 96 8927757: Okay thank you
16/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: These are just tentative dates, not the final ones, so are you parents willing to follow this?
16/01/24, 2:20 pm - +260 97 9527180: Sure
16/01/24, 2:22 pm - +260 97 9527180: Option 1 is favorable
16/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: So @260979527180 are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case @260968927757 gets selected into the program?
*Please answer in a Voice note format*
16/01/24, 2:38 pm - +260 97 9527180: We first agree as a family and get back to you.
16/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please get back to me till tomorrow.
16/01/24, 2:45 pm - +260 97 9527180: Okay, noted

17/01/24, 8:50 am - +260 97 9527180: We are so grateful for this opportunity that was given to our daughter, Unfortunately, our finances are so limited and we will not be able to manage to take her abroad. We will contact you if we happen to be financially stable during the course of the year. Thank you so much for this opportunity. Please continue your good deed, you are an amazing team.
17/01/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the issue that you are facing?
17/01/24, 9:06 am - +260 97 9527180: We are facing financial challenges as of now
17/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Let me share that, right now you just have to worry about the enrollment fee, which will start her EWYL journey, assuming that she can earn $100 every month, she will have close to $700 for her fees, which will ease your financial burden for her fees.
17/01/24, 9:32 am - +260 97 9527180: Our main challenge is the enrollment fee that has a deadline and the fear is that we might not be able to raise it within the requested period.
17/01/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: So please share that concern with me, I am there to find a solution for you Mrs Wata.
17/01/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: May I know, till when can you raise the initial $200?
17/01/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 9527180: Probably by March,  we might be okay by God's Grace.
17/01/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Please, may I know, that did you not had any savings for Namooba's education?
17/01/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 9527180: It's not easy to do so, we face too many challenges
17/01/24, 12:31 pm - +260 95 5140326: Thank you so much 
That is all from us.
17/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Can you try to arrange the finances until february?
17/01/24, 12:57 pm - +260 97 9527180: We will try and get back to you. Thank you
17/01/24, 10:16 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
18/01/24, 8:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

18/01/24, 2:30 pm - +260 96 8927757: And we have not done that yet
18/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please, If we do that and you are found eligible, and then you don't have finances, then you would have to pay reapplication fee, which I don't want for you.
