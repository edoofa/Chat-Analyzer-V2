12/01/24, 8:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mulindi Mwaka!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:23 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning sir.
My shallow understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program is that the programme is design to reduce the financial burden that less privileged but gifted individuals have. It is meant for focused people that can't afford quality university /college education. It also aim to see to it that the graduates get employment easily.
This is what I know about Edoofa scholarship program.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 9:39 am - +260 97 3906423: Yes this is like reducing the burdens that is weighed on our parents and this program can help our parents in all this
12/01/24, 9:41 am - +260 97 3906423: And I think it will help me persue a better future for myself and it will help me be an independent student and take more responsibility towards higher education by myself
12/01/24, 9:45 am - +260 97 7576833: Indeed, just like Mwaka has put it, us parents are faced with numerous financial challenges especially concerning the education of our children. Considering the high standards of living coupled with the insufficient income flow, we find it difficult to support quality university for our children.
It is for this reason Edoofa scholarships were established, I believe.
12/01/24, 9:46 am - +260 97 7576833: , *quality university *education*
12/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 3906423: According to what you said about the program students that have their families in their parents around during the session have a high possibility of getting 80% to 100% on tuition and accomodations so I'm looking forward to Al the procedure
12/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 3906423: *All the procedures
12/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 97 3906423: And I guess I have what it takes for me to get a higher quantum of scholarship
12/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Now Mwaka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

12/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study pharmacy, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 97 3906423: What motivates me behind this study is the love I have for treating people. I feel motivated and encouraged when I see new medications being discovered. Many diseases keep on arising and I would like to be one of the people in the Frontline helping discover new medications and also being able to dispense this medications to the patients. It is of great joy to be able to help patients each and everyday to get the medication they need. I  also like the idea of  being able to get knowledge on how the certain drugs can help in improving ones health and how they can be administered.
12/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is great,So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
12/01/24, 2:13 pm - +260 97 3906423: From my family there is no one. But from a known circle I know  three of my sister's friends who have pursued this career.
12/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?

13/01/24, 7:53 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/01/24, 10:01 am - +260 97 7627754: Good morning to you too. You are actually correct and everything depends on our participation.
13/01/24, 10:18 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning.
Thank you for the encouragement. The discussion can now start.
13/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: So Mr and Mrs Mulindi, may I know, why didn't you encourage Mwaka to take Pure Physics and Pure Chemistry?
13/01/24, 10:23 am - +260 97 7576833: Thank you for that concern. It was our concern too. However, her school (Njase secondary school) was not offering pure sciences by then.
From the information I gathered, their first pure class was introduced last year.
13/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 7576833: I have been corrected. The Pure class started in 2021.
The school careers and guidance office allocated their learners to classes. We could not insist on her being in a pure class because we(as parents) were not aware that a pure class was introduced.
13/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Mr and Mrs Mulindi, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
13/01/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: I understand you have a keen interest in pursuing a career in the field of healthcare, specifically in pharmacy. While pharmacy is indeed a fantastic field, I'd like to introduce you to another exciting option that might align better with your current academic background and still lead you into the world of healthcare – BSc Biochemistry.

Here's why BSc Biochemistry could be an excellent choice for you:

Interdisciplinary Nature: Biochemistry is at the intersection of biology and chemistry. It allows you to explore the molecular processes that occur within living organisms. This interdisciplinary nature might suit your academic background and provide you with a well-rounded understanding of the biological and chemical aspects.

Versatility in Career Options: A degree in Biochemistry opens doors to various career paths. You can still work in the pharmaceutical industry, research labs, or even healthcare management. It provides flexibility, allowing you to discover your niche within the broad spectrum of healthcare.

Potential for Further Studies: If you ever decide to specialize further, having a foundation in Biochemistry can lead you to postgraduate studies in areas such as pharmacology, biotechnology, or even specific pharmaceutical sciences.

Practical Laboratory Skills: Biochemistry programs often emphasize hands-on laboratory work. This practical experience can enhance your skills and make you more competitive in the job market.

Remember, it's not about the subjects you lack; it's about finding a path that aligns with your strengths and interests. BSc Biochemistry could be that bridge between your current academic foundation and a fulfilling career in healthcare.
13/01/24, 11:41 am - +260 97 7576833: Wow, that sounds interesting.
How possible is it for a graduate of BSc in Biochemistry to directly enter the job market? Looking into the Zambian situation where can she work from?
13/01/24, 11:41 am - +260 97 3906423: Since you have suggested that a degree in Biochemistry can be a more fantastic field a can pursue and it can still lead me into a pharmaceutical industry.where then can I be guaranteed to have a job immediately after my graduation?, in short where can a person with a degree in Biochemistry work from?
13/01/24, 11:45 am - +260 97 7576833: Exactly my concern.
Nevertheless, allow me to do a quick research on this field in the Zambian job market.
13/01/24, 12:08 pm - +260 97 7576833: Where can I find job opportunities for biochemists in Zambia?


Job opportunities for biochemists in Zambia can be found in a variety of industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and biotechnology. They can be found on online job boards, in newspapers and other classified ads, and on the websites of specific companies that hire biochemists.

In conclusion, pursuing a career in biochemistry in Zambia can be a lucrative and rewarding choice. With a range of job opportunities available in various industries, and the demand for biochemists increasing, it is a field with good prospects for career advancement. By obtaining the necessary qualifications and skills, and keeping up with the latest developments in the field, you can position yourself for success in this exciting and challenging profession



This is what I found on the Internet.
I feel it is a very good career.
Mwaka will have to make a final decision.
13/01/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi, you have done an excellent research, and let me add something, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
13/01/24, 12:26 pm - +260 97 7576833: May I find out which prominent Universities offer this course in India, it's reputation, it's location and any other important information?
13/01/24, 12:26 pm - +260 97 3906423: That is good news that as a university you get to secure a good job within India whilst the students are in their final year and that is a good guarantee for us people who are pursuing that certain course
13/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world( after scholarship $6000-$8000), as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

2. Eligibility: As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

3. Length of the program: Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
15/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes you parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
15/01/24, 2:38 pm - +260 97 7576833: How about cardiology?
15/01/24, 2:39 pm - +260 97 7576833: Or nuero-surgion?
15/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please all these courses fall under medicine only.
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - +260 97 7576833: Noted
15/01/24, 2:52 pm - +260 97 7627754: Noted
15/01/24, 2:57 pm - +260 97 4416299: Thanks, apart from medicine I think that pharmacy can be convenient for my parents and maybe for me to get a scholarship.
15/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

15/01/24, 3:01 pm - +260 97 7576833: Clear and well elaborated
15/01/24, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7576833: I hope our two candidates, Mwaka and Noel understand this.
15/01/24, 3:03 pm - +260 97 4416299: Yes this is crystal clear.
15/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course.
15/01/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 4416299: That would be great.

15/01/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noel in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
15/01/24, 3:24 pm - +260 97 4416299: Alright, so as you said it ensures employment opportunities while you are still in India.
Can you kindly elaborate on the Edoofa program in terms of it's Main aim.
15/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/01/24, 3:29 pm - +260 97 4416299: Thank you, it has given me a clear understanding on the benefits of Edoofa.
15/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 97 4416299: When you take a look at my results can it be advised for me to take the pharmacy course? 
If not can you kindly suggest on which course can be best.
15/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Please, pharmacy is well pursued course all over the world, plus being a white-collar job gives pharmacists a certain respect.
15/01/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 4416299: Alright thanks for the advise.
15/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/01/24, 3:58 pm - +260 97 4416299: If am given this opportunity I see my self as a successful man who's completed his education with a great success. After five years I see my working in a well renowned work place and I see my being able to help others through my success.
If am given an opportunity to get into the Edoofa program I believe it can help immersly through providing of a scholarship and being able to relieve the pressure on my parents.
If my parents are relieved of paying my higher education abroad it helps me to focus more on the course and the reason I am in India.
15/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Noel I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations.
15/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: So is @260977576833 active?
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 97 4416299: Thanks
15/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 97 4416299: Yes he is
15/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 97 3906423: He has a bright future ahead of him
15/01/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: So @260977576833 , can you please tell me why you want your children to study abroad and not in your country?
15/01/24, 4:05 pm - +260 97 7576833: I am following the discussion. He aim is to better lives of his ageing parents (us).
15/01/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
15/01/24, 4:10 pm - +260 97 7627754: As a mother, I feel my children can study anywhere but if Edoofa accords then an opportunity then we can be very great full as parents, because it will help us relieve some pressure.
15/01/24, 4:11 pm - +260 97 7576833: Thanks for all that has been said.
The main reason why I would want my children to study medical courses is that India is well known for producing excellent medical personnel. Furthermore, medical education from India is recognised worldwide.
I am also motivated to allow them to go abroad because of the scholarship hopefully they will get from Edoofa. This will relieve me and my wife from the financial burden associated with university education in Zambia.
15/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for them to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning for them to study abroad.
15/01/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/01/24, 4:22 pm - +260 97 7627754: Indeed
15/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

15/01/24, 4:41 pm - +260 97 7576833: In fact the desire is to have both of them give a scholarship. Please consider our humble plea as parents.
15/01/24, 10:06 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
15/01/24, 10:08 pm - +260 97 7576833: Thanks. Good night.
16/01/24, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/01/24, 8:52 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning sir.
16/01/24, 9:01 am - +260 97 4416299: Morning sir
16/01/24, 9:02 am - +260 97 3906423: Good morning
16/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: So now Mr Mulindi, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/01/24, 9:46 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning again.
I now fully understand the important role that Edoofa is playing here.
My questions are :
1. Is it possible to take both my children on scholarship of say 80% to 100%?
2. Are there universities offering business and technology courses, for instance, Financial Engeneering? 
3. Is there any provision for making Mr and Mrs Mulindi Edoofa ambassadors?
16/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: To answer your first question, yes any student can get 80% to 100% scholarship, but that will depend on the test and the interview after which everything will be analyzed by the academic board.
16/01/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: For the second question, both of your children have got a course which is well pursued and offers a lot of job opportunities for them, based on these factors alone, the courses offered to them are best for their futures, based on the subject they had in grade 12.
16/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: And for the last question, yes there are provisions for parents becoming Edoofa Ambassadors, but before that may I know, what do you understand by the same(being an Ambassador for Edoofa)? <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 7576833: Promoting the Edoofa program our country. Many people are not aware of such good arrangements. There are so many parents who would love to have their children have international education but have no means.
16/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 7627754: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
16/01/24, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi, I will put a formal recommendation for you to be an Ambassador for the program, but first, let us finish the counselling session for both of your children.
16/01/24, 11:05 am - +260 97 7576833: Alright.
16/01/24, 11:06 am - +260 97 7576833: You can proceed sir with the candidates.
16/01/24, 11:07 am - +260 97 7627754: You can now proceed with the session
16/01/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/01/24, 12:21 pm - +260 97 7627754: No, we are not familiar. How are the costs?
16/01/24, 12:24 pm - +260 97 3906423: We are not that familiar
16/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 97 7576833: We don't have that information. May you please guide us.
16/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/01/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 12:45 pm - +260 97 7627754: Noted
16/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *B.Sc. Biochemistry & Bachelor of Pharmacy* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/01/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: *Please note that this is for one student*
16/01/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
16/01/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7576833: I am following keenly.
May you elaborate clearly what you mean by the two courses being a ' *niche* '
16/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: The term "niche" is applied to certain courses due to their specialized, unique, and focused nature. B.Sc. Biochemistry and Bachelor of Pharmacy are unequivocally considered niche courses because they demand in-depth knowledge and skills in specific areas—biochemistry for B.Sc. Biochemistry and pharmaceuticals for Bachelor of Pharmacy.

Here are the factual reasons why these courses are deemed niche:

Specialized Knowledge: Both Biochemistry and Pharmacy require a high degree of specialized scientific knowledge. Biochemistry centers on the study of chemical processes and substances within living organisms, while Pharmacy is dedicated to the design and dispensing of medications.

Limited Scholarship Seats: The acknowledgment of "fewer scholarship seats" affirms the existence of a restricted number of scholarships for these courses. This limitation may stem from factors such as high demand, specific industry needs, or the elevated level of expertise required in these fields.

Higher Costs: The documented annual fee after the scholarship is indeed higher for these niche courses ($2700-$3700) in comparison to the general range of $2000-$3000. This underlines the factual observation that the cost of delivering these specialized programs, encompassing resources, faculty expertise, and facilities, is inherently higher.
16/01/24, 1:38 pm - +260 97 7627754: Noted
16/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 7576833: We can proceed to the next stage
16/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/01/24, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7627754: Yes please
16/01/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/01/24, 2:41 pm - +260 97 7576833: It a good arrangement.
Does the EWYL program start in the first year of study?
16/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the EWYL program starts from the time when you enroll with the program.
16/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

16/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/01/24, 2:54 pm - +260 97 7576833: I am very sure it will benefit the children and us the parents
16/01/24, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mr Mulindi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/01/24, 3:04 pm - +260 97 7576833: Very clear.
So it means that placement to the EWYL program is done upon enrolment to an institution of learning.
16/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/01/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/01/24, 3:18 pm - +260 97 7576833: Very unique indeed.
I hope their is enough time for the main course work studies.
16/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Mulindi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting your children for their higher education. <This message was edited>
16/01/24, 3:25 pm - +260 97 7576833: Oh, yes sir. Though it will really be a struggle.
16/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: I understand.
16/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/01/24, 3:30 pm - +260 97 7576833: Yes
16/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Mulindi as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/01/24, 3:48 pm - +260 97 7576833: Atmost K2250
16/01/24, 3:49 pm - +260 97 7576833: Sorry $2250
16/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mr Mulindi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/01/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/01/24, 4:03 pm - +260 97 7576833: Noted
16/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/01/24, 4:18 pm - +260 97 7576833: This is good news.
17/01/24, 8:33 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/01/24, 8:45 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning sir.
17/01/24, 9:00 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/01/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
17/01/24, 9:18 am - +260 97 7576833: Understood
17/01/24, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
17/01/24, 9:30 am - +260 97 7576833: No
17/01/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/01/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Mulindi, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
17/01/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
17/01/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
17/01/24, 10:34 am - +260 97 7576833: I have read and I understood all the stages. I hope to complete them all.
17/01/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
17/01/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
17/01/24, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
17/01/24, 10:54 am - +260 97 7576833: When do we start with the 2nd stage?
17/01/24, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
17/01/24, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/01/24, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
