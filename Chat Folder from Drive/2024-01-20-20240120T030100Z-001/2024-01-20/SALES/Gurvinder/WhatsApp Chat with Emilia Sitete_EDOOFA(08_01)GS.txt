10/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Emilia, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tafadzwa, is that correct?
10/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 828 0118: Yes sir
10/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 828 0118: Ok Mr Gurvinder
10/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 77 252 1604: I'm Mrs Zimunya, Emilia's Aunt.

10/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 252 1604: Yes I learnt it from Tafadzwa and I lastly heard that she was awarded the scholarship.
10/01/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
10/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 828 0118: It is ,,Mr Gurvinder.. that's quite impressive
10/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 71 828 0118: And I am looking for something at that sort
10/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Taking about the 50_100% tuition fee,,, I would like to know more about that offer and the condition for one to have the 100% offer
10/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 252 1604: Quite impressive. I'm very delighted you have the Earn While You Learn Program & I'm sure my niece will grab it given the opportunity. I know Mr Shorwi Kawadza  head of Hrtzel.
10/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Zimunya, Mr Shorwi is our very close and old associate.
10/01/24, 9:20 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

11/01/24, 7:44 am - +263 71 828 0118: Good morning
11/01/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 828 0118: Good morning..thank you
11/01/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why were you inactive yesterday?
11/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 71 828 0118: My network was really down so I would see the messages late
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Emilia, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,Mr Gurvinder ,,I have what it takes to meet  these two significant metrics,,,
11/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 252 1604: Good morning everyone. Apologies for getting online late. I was travelling.
11/01/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Now Emilia, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

11/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
11/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yeah ,, that's true ,Mr Gurvinder
11/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 828 0118: And I really love studying Sociology a lot
11/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
11/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,Mr Gurvinder ,,, I already achieved,,, I obtained 15points
11/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, so shall I brief you about the course?
11/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,,you can go ahead ,, I am waiting😁
11/01/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs.

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 9:17 am - +263 71 828 0118: Good morning
12/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 252 1604: Good morning
12/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 828 0118: Ok
12/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 828 0118: After the completion of my course in 5 years,,I am seeing myself as someone who will raise both the Zimbabwean and the Indian flag higher in the sense that once I get a job,,,my first priority is the other orphans ...thus the more I will earn ,,,the more I will be a philanthropist.So, if  I get the chance to be an Edoofan,, I am pretty sure I will be able to pursue my dream of becoming someone who will be of value to other people's lives,, specifically the need and the vulnerable children
12/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 828 0118: What gives me the urge to want to study sociology is because of the fact that during my high school ,,as we were doing some sociological researches ,,when we were doing Crime and Deviance in society,,,,we discovered that some of the crimes committed by the minor emanates from the family they come from ,,,so because of poverty,,,young people would end up stealing and involve themselves in drug dealing ,,,and I just felt ,,if these children had the opportunity to go to school ,,,there would be no such things....thus ,,I would like to study sociology so that with time I will be able to help those who come from disadvantaged families.
12/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Emilia I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
12/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 828 0118: Yes ,,Mr Gurvinder ,, I am willing to give my 200% hard work and to take all the opportunities that will come my way inorder to transform my carrier.
12/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 71 828 0118: The most reason is based on the quality of education that is offered in India as it is counted
third in the  education sector globally.
To add I believe studying abroad ensures exposure and I get to meet various people in different institutions.
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 71 828 0118: If I am given the opportunity to study abroad through the Edoofa scholarship,I going to assist in the development of the education system of my country by providing relevant sources of the course ..,,for example ,,, when my dream gets fullfilled ,,, I will help my country by donating text books which will contain the wealthy of information I receive abroad...and I have a very good example of someone I know ,,,who wrote and published A'level Sociology textbooks,,,,so as to help many students..so I will do the same
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Emilia, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 828 0118: I agree,,Mr Gurvinder
12/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
12/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yes ,,Mr Gurvinder,, I learnt that in History that India was also colonized by Britain
12/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Hello
12/01/24, 10:20 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

13/01/24, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: So now Emilia, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
13/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 828 0118: I have understood very well ,,Mr Gurvinder.
13/01/24, 10:18 am - +263 71 828 0118: I would like to know ,,Mr Gurvinder ,,let's say I have completed my 3year BA in Sociology course,,,if I want to proceed to a Master's degree ,, is that mean the scholarship will cover up for me or by that time I will be responsible
13/01/24, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: Please, you can do master's under our program too.
13/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 71 828 0118: Oh that's amazing
13/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 828 0118: I nolonger have any question to ask ,,
13/01/24, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
13/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 828 0118: Not really
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Wow! Noted...
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 828 0118: So may you explain to me the Earn While you Learn thing,,if you don't mind🙃
13/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Wow! I can see that the cost of education in India is better
13/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

15/01/24, 8:31 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 71 828 0118: Good morning
15/01/24, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 828 0118: Sure,Mr Gurvinder
15/01/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Emilia, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 828 0118: Wow! quite impressive..and I can see that the Earn While you Learn program makes students to be independent
15/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 71 828 0118: Also,, I'm so glad that this program gives students the best of working experience
15/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

15/01/24, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 828 0118: I think if I get the opportunity to be an Edoofan,,,this will benefit me a lot
15/01/24, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Emilia, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 828 0118: Wow! so intriguing.,,and I would like to know if the annual tuition fee is paid fully or it can be paid in halves
15/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 71 828 0118: I have been asking questions regarding to international education on how students can be self_reliant and I am glad that I have just found answers here,Mr Gurvinder
15/01/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Alright Emilia, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 71 828 0118: That's true ,,Mr Gurvinder
15/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 828 0118: Yes ,, I discussed with them,, including my aunt Mrs Zimunya ,, who's also part of this online program
15/01/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 252 1604: Good afternoon Mr. Gurvinder. Yes Emilia discussed with me about Edoofa Scholarhip program and I'm aware of the financial aspects.
15/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,,Mr Gurvinder I am ready
15/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Emilia as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 828 0118: If the student applies in 5 universities,,that means he/she will end up spending around $2000
15/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Emilia, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Noted
15/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Oh ,, I see
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Wow!I like the idea that students won't  pay separate fees for multiple applications
15/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Ok..
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Emilia basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Noted
15/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Mmm..I need a little bit understanding of the Edoofa Cycle
15/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Emilia, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
15/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Yes,, I have understood it
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
15/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 828 0118: Oh ,you have already answered the question that I was about to ask,,that the remaining fee will be paid in installments
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
\
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

The forthcoming essay is going to assess on life of Rwanda 16years after genocide..To start with,,the term genocide mean an act of killing a whole group of people,,,so  all people of Rwanda are killed ,,,that will probably mean there is nolonger Rwanda nationality.Furthermore,,,the ecosystem will be unbalanced in the sense that there are those animals which depends on human activities for survival,for example,,,baboons can survive by eating crops so if there are nolonger people in that environment ,,that means there will be no farmer..To elucidate more,,the vegetation itself will vanish because some plants survive by being watered by humans so if people are killed ,,,that means there is no chance for some plants to survive..Some plants like hen,,goats and sheep need to be sheltered by people ,,,and on their own they cannot survive as they will be prey to some wild animals so,,the killing of humans in the Rwanda may also result in complete exhaustion of domestic animals because without humans,,,the word domestic animal does not apply.

19/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 828 0118: Good morning
19/01/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: So are there any questions you want to ask?
19/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 252 1604: We have no questions yet. Today our network is not stable, it is raining.
19/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, if you are clear about the transaction options?
19/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 252 1604: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 77 252 1604: What I just want to confirm is that if I use Mr. Kwadza's account he'll definetely forward it to Edoofa and I will not have challenges of incomplete transactions?
19/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Please do not worry about that, Mr Shorwi has been our very old associate, you will face no such issues.
19/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 252 1604: Noted. Thank you.
19/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
19/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
