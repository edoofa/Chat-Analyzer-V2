59 - 19 Jan 2024 09:16AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
60 - 19 Jan 2024 09:16AM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

47 - 19 Jan 2024 08:36AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!  Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post :  *https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==*
48 - 19 Jan 2024 08:41AM - +263 77 756 9307: Good morning. I am father of Malvern. Malvern is nolonger a prospective Edoofian. I faced hurdles with Paypal to make payments to Edoofa. I made 2 attempts but each time my account was being debited but the payments would not go through and was being reversed. I tried to get help from Admissions team for way forward, but they have been quite. As a result  i had to withdraw the money and pay somewhere else as cash. So i and Malvern nolonger belong to Edoofa family. You.may cancel all programs with Malvern and delete this group. I want to thank you very much for the time we had been together.
49 - 19 Jan 2024 09:24AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you must be having a word with Mr Piiyush regarding this, right?

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days. *Sounds interesting, right?*
46 - 19 Jan 2024 01:50PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yeah it sounds so interesting l just can't wait for this
47 - 19 Jan 2024 01:52PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

128 - 19 Jan 2024 06:13AM - +263 78 395 8654: 1. The three projects are;  Corporate Alliances Community building, African Schools Education Reform Mission. 2.What do you understand from project 1. Project 1 is Corporate Alliances whereby a student is assigned to learn practically to interact with companies/ stakeholders in his/ her country  and connect them to the manager of Edoofa, by involving video call, and signing of contracts using online information. The student must identify a company which is within Africa or his/her continent then follow the activities online using LinkedIn account to connect and collect the needed information until they reach an agreement of contract signing which link the stakeholders and the Edoofa manager. By completing this process, the student earn Scholarship credits. 2: My understanding from project 2 which is Community building is that the project is about advertising the goodness of Edoofa Educational ecosystem to young age groups who have just graduated from senior Secondary school recently within 6 months or who are yet to finish their senior Secondary school education to be part of the Edoofa program, so that they can fulfil their dreams and understand the developing of an organization which is based on growing by creating social impact. When you complete this stage that's when certain amounts of Scholarship credits are offered. 3: Project 3 which is African Schools Education Reform Mission is when a student is directed to reach local senior Secondary schools and facilitate decision makers to connect with Edoofa. The main aim of Edoofa being connected to the decision makers is to transform and share world class technology and improve African Education. They will share career counseling, courses and Scholarship opportunities . When identifying Schools, your School must be the first listed. The student will be identified through LinkedIn account. Also after completing this you can earn Scholarship credits.

144 - 19 Jan 2024 09:55AM - +263 78 395 8654: The guide for searching companies - this document helps me to look for potential companies who are willing to collaborate with Edoofa. The company must be willing to extend all students development that have been enrolled in Edoofa program. When choosing the right type of companies, the following factors must be considered: 1. The nature of the company if it is student friendly. 2. Scale of the company which must not be too big or too small. 3. The Financial stability where the selected company must be financially stable and can be observed through a LinkedIn account. 4. Background of the founder he/she must be highly qualified. To notice all this there are steps that can be followed through Google, LinkedIn, Inc4media and many more. The six steps provided must be followed for easy identification of the required information.
145 - 19 Jan 2024 11:09AM - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Delight, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

A university is going to make me have more knowledge about the course that l always dreamt of doing which is Psychology. It has always been one of my goals too so as l further my education through university will be able to be better and well educated in that course and all of my goals start through getting into university and acquiring knowledge about the course deeper.

I want to be able to have campaigns against staying silent when one is mentally depressed. One person's health matters especially emotionally and mentally, people have to know about the dangers of depression and anxiety. After everything else want to have a positive impact in the society.

160 - 19 Jan 2024 08:25AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes l have
161 - 19 Jan 2024 08:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Please share your response with us
186 - 19 Jan 2024 10:08AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
187 - 19 Jan 2024 10:08AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
188 - 19 Jan 2024 10:35AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes, correct
189 - 19 Jan 2024 10:35AM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.  As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
190 - 19 Jan 2024 10:40AM - +263 78 378 6270: They are all in full support of my decision and they just went on researching more and more about Edoofa so that they get better knowledge about the program , also the pdf  about edoofa helped them to discard their distrust towards the program. They definitely feel this is the best opportunity that we all as family were waiting for  so as to make me fulfill and achieve my dreams that l had. The assurance we getting daily and during the interviews and sessions it's making them feel confident enough that everything is going to go as played.
191 - 19 Jan 2024 10:57AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
192 - 19 Jan 2024 11:03AM - +263 78 378 6270: Yes , we are
193 - 19 Jan 2024 11:15AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800).
194 - 19 Jan 2024 11:15AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Gulzar Group of Institutes.  Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.  Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutesas a collective?
475 - 19 Jan 2024 10:18AM - +260 96 4841330: Goodmorning thanks mr Ashi

477 - 19 Jan 2024 10:21AM - +260 96 4841330: Yes we did
478 - 19 Jan 2024 10:25AM - +260 96 4841330: Is it possible that she can be offered another offer letter from another university/college? Or we just start preparing for Gulzar? I have asked this because In our previous discussions you talked about a situation where a student is accepted by two universities/college  which gives a student an opportunity to choose where she wants go
479 - 19 Jan 2024 10:41AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.  I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
480 - 19 Jan 2024 10:41AM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
481 - 19 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.  I hope you are clear about this now?
482 - 19 Jan 2024 10:53AM - +260 96 4841330: Very very clear thanks
483 - 19 Jan 2024 11:01AM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?",No,No

188 - 19 Jan 2024 03:08PM - +263 71 622 0692: Qstn. 2) There is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.Entrepreneurship is the ability of a person to take risk by venturing into a new business activity bringing new products or services and it is a key driver of economic development .  Economic development is the process by which a country or region improves its economic well-being, often through increases in the productivity and standard of living. This can be measured in various ways, such as increases in gross domestic product (GDP), per capita income, employment levels, or other indicators of economic health. Economic development often involves the adoption of new technologies, improvements in infrastructure, and the development of new industries.  Entrepreneurship creates new new businesses thereby creating employment for the local people.for example when Zimplats Holdings started it's operation it employed it's workers from the communities surrounding the company's mining operations in Zimbabwe and this contributed to development of Zimbabwe's economy.  Moreover entrepreneurship often initiates the manufacturing of new products which also leads to increase in exports and stimulate demand for other products further contributing to economic growth (there will be a development in the economy.  Moreover entrepreneurship promotes innovation which usually leads to new and advanced technology and processes that improve the efficiency of businesses thereby increasing economic growth (that is economy will be developed).  In a nut shell entrepreneurs enables infrastructure development since they take social responsibilities in the areas of operation ,  reduces unemployment level in the economy as well as reducin inflation since there will be an increase in the gross domestic product of the country.

207 - 19 Jan 2024 11:33AM - +263 71 745 9650: 2). What is the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development?  Answering the second question , the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is complicated and can vary from one country to another based on their level of economic growth . In highly developed economies , entrepreneurs can accelerate growth , while in less- developed ones they may have less of a positive effect. Entrepreneurship and economic growth go hand in hand , with innovation acting as a catalyst for growth . According to my own thinking , there is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development. Entrepreneurship can drive economic development by creating jobs, boosting productivity, and introducing new technologies and innovations to the market. In addition, entrepreneurs can play a role in solving economic problems by finding creative solutions to issues like poverty, unemployment, and access to basic services. They can also help foster growth in new industries and stimulate demand for goods and services. To facilitate innovation driven entrepreneurship, government and institutions play a crucial role by fostering an environment that supports sustained economic development.
208 - 19 Jan 2024 11:36AM - +263 71 745 9650: 3). Please share your understanding of GAAP and it's importance ?  GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) are the guidelines by which most finance professionals record and report financial performance In a company . GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial statements are consistent, accurate, and reliable. This allows businesses to make informed decisions, and it also allows investors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about a company. GAAP also helps to promote transparency and fairness in the financial reporting process. GAAP also helps to prevent misrepresentation in financial reporting. It  also promotes efficient capital markets, as investors can rely on the accuracy of financial statements when making investment decisions. While GAAP is not regulated by Government, it was created through a collaboration between business and government. It isn't mandatory for all businesses , but is highly recommend, especially if one plans to eventually go public or if you expect to be raising capital or preparing for another transaction in the near future . Finally , GAAP promotes consistency , as it allows for apples -to- apples comparisons of financial statements from different companies.
209 - 19 Jan 2024 11:37AM - +263 71 745 9650: 4). What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?  Accounting standards are a set of rules and guidelines that govern how financial information is recorded and reported. Accounting standards are developed by professional organizations, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States. These standards are mandatory because they help to ensure that financial reporting is consistent and reliable. Without accounting standards, companies could potentially report their financial information in a way that is misleading or even fraudulent. Accounting standards are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) . Mandatory standards help to ensure that companies follow best practices when it comes to financial reporting. They help to protect the interests of stakeholders, including investors and creditors. Mandatory standards help to promote transparency and accountability within the financial system. They specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured , presented and disclosed in financial statements. It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in the accounting process and also make statements comparable with other organizations.  Finally, they help to level the playing field for companies, so that everyone is playing by the same rules.
210 - 19 Jan 2024 11:37AM - +263 71 745 9650: 5). Please differentiate between accounting and auditing ?  Accounting and auditing are two closely related but distinct fields. accounting involves the recording, classifying, and summarizing of financial transactions, while auditing involves the examination and evaluation of the accuracy of financial statements. In other words, accounting focuses on the collection and preparation of financial information, while auditing focuses on the review and verification of that information. One major difference is in the objectives of each field. The objective of accounting is to provide useful financial information to decision makers, while the objective of auditing is to provide an independent opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. Another difference is in the parties that each field serves. Accounting serves internal parties, such as management, while auditing serves external parties, such as investors and creditors. In simple terms accounting is the continuous process of managing and maintaining financial records . Whereas auditing is a periodic process that validates the accuracy of financial statements .
211 - 19 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley! I hope you are doing well. Thank you for providing the responses to the documents, I have taken note of these and will update them in our records. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our conversation?
212 - 19 Jan 2024 03:10PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, absolutely.
213 - 19 Jan 2024 03:14PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
214 - 19 Jan 2024 03:16PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
215 - 19 Jan 2024 03:19PM - +263 71 745 9650: All in progress and l will pay next week
242 - 19 Jan 2024 03:56PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
243 - 19 Jan 2024 03:56PM - +263 71 745 9650: Correct
244 - 19 Jan 2024 03:59PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
245 - 19 Jan 2024 04:02PM - +263 71 745 9650: Please do sir
246 - 19 Jan 2024 04:41PM - +263 71 745 9650: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms. Aditi and she has scheduled my session for Monday .
247 - 19 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date.
248 - 19 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
249 - 19 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
250 - 19 Jan 2024 06:37PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure lm also wondering the same",No,Yes

296 - 19 Jan 2024 03:41PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Picking up from our last conversation, you must have understood the plan for the first 10 months of the Edoofa Secure Plan.  With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
297 - 19 Jan 2024 03:42PM - +263 77 307 9320: Yes
298 - 19 Jan 2024 03:42PM - +263 77 307 9320: Understood
304 - 19 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in your   Bank in Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
305 - 19 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
306 - 19 Jan 2024 04:06PM - +263 77 307 9320: It sounds good but will be comfortable to pay it when it is required because will be assisted by other family members,  so if l start saying can you give me the money like now they won't so we can wait till the time comes and we will work on it.
307 - 19 Jan 2024 04:19PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263773079320! I understand and it is totally up to you to take up this Plan if you are comfortable without it. It is proposed to make sure that parents are able to prepare their finances accordingly, as every year, we observe that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program are not able to come to India due to improper preparation of finances. I hope you understand our concern?

115 - 19 Jan 2024 07:59PM - Dev Edoofa: Oh, that is alright. Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'*  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
116 - 19 Jan 2024 08:00PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
117 - 19 Jan 2024 08:00PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
118 - 19 Jan 2024 08:01PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family, I am certain that Prudence too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

100 - 19 Jan 2024 09:03AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents and forms, dear. I have taken a note of it.
101 - 19 Jan 2024 09:10AM - +263 71 445 2768: Good morning ma’am
102 - 19 Jan 2024 09:11AM - +263 71 445 2768: You’re welcome
103 - 19 Jan 2024 09:27AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
104 - 19 Jan 2024 09:32AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am

117 - 19 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
118 - 19 Jan 2024 10:22AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
119 - 19 Jan 2024 10:24AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok thank you
120 - 19 Jan 2024 10:24AM - +263 71 445 2768: Understood
121 - 19 Jan 2024 11:03AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
122 - 19 Jan 2024 11:03AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
123 - 19 Jan 2024 11:05AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ok ma’am thank you
124 - 19 Jan 2024 11:05AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ma’am I did not get my scholarship percentage

124 - 19 Jan 2024 11:05AM - +263 71 445 2768: Ma’am I did not get my scholarship percentage
125 - 19 Jan 2024 11:11AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am not quite able to understand your concern here. Could you explain it to me, dear?

127 - 19 Jan 2024 11:32AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I see. Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me to explain it. May I know if you are confused about the score or the scholarship percentage?
128 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - +263 71 445 2768: The scholarship percentage
129 - 19 Jan 2024 12:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The scholarship percentage has been awarded on the basis of the evaluation of academic board. It refers to the minimum scholarship percentage you will receive in your offer letter once the university has accepted your application. I hope this was helpful?
130 - 19 Jan 2024 12:53PM - +263 71 445 2768: Now it’s clear
131 - 19 Jan 2024 12:53PM - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you ma’am for helping me

226 - 19 Jan 2024 06:45AM - +263 78 289 6783: 3. A prosecutor is the legal representative responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against the defendant whereas an attorney is someone trained and educated in law who acts as a practitioner in a court of law. A prosecutor works as a government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the attorney represents the accused and attempts to maintain the client's innocence. A prosecutor works closely with the police department within their jurisdiction investigating and gathering evidence whilst a lawyer has to hire their own private investigator if there is need for an investigation or witnesses. A prosecutor's role in court is gathering evidence and witnesses to prove to the court that the accused is guilty of a crime. However, an attorney does the exact opposite by gathering evidence and witnesses with the intent to defend the accused and prove their client did not commit the crime.
227 - 19 Jan 2024 06:45AM - +263 78 289 6783: 4. I am most interested in pursuing Civil law. Civil law offers a high degree of legal certainity. Civil law provides stability and confidence to individuals and businesses when making legal decisions. Civil law provides clear guidelines for legal relationships. It helps to prevent blurring lines between various legal contexts by helping individuals understand their rights and obligations. It is a way for all citizens to pursue equal representation and justice despite it not always being the case. One of my favourite quotes about civil law by one of the earliest civil law practitioners, Roman statesman Cicero ""Civil law is the thing that neither influence can affect nor power nor money or corruption."" This shows how civil law helps in building a stable society where individuals are able to pursue their ambitions freely. Civilaw is more concerned with making the community a better place by fixing private disputes between its members. Civil law focuses on conflict resolution and encourages cooperation between members of society.
228 - 19 Jan 2024 08:45AM - +263 78 289 6783: 5. I possess good verbal and communication skills. In my opinion these are the most important skills a successful lawyer needs in order to convey information in a digestible and concise way. I am also a good listener, in order to win a case a lawyer needs to listen to all the facts being presented and getting important details correct. This also ensures a great relationship with my clients. I am a good team player. Winning cases needs to be a team effort hence a successful lawyer needs to productively work alongside colleagues and clients. I am very thorough with my work and I pay great attention to detail. A great eye to even the smallest detail means I will be able to complete my legal research error-free. I am emotionally intelligent. A lot of cases need to be treated sensitively in order to build trust in clients and maintain a good working relationship with them. I am organized and meticulous, I also work well under pressure. A successful lawyer needs to remain focused as the legal profession can be incredibly demanding and fast-paced.

239 - 19 Jan 2024 09:33AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 11 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
240 - 19 Jan 2024 09:35AM - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am, we will be able to pay the remaining fee by end of day tomorrow (Saturday 20 January).
241 - 19 Jan 2024 09:35AM - +263 77 364 2468: Thanks for the reminder. We appreciate your kindness
242 - 19 Jan 2024 09:41AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
243 - 19 Jan 2024 09:41AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
295 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
296 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
297 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
298 - 19 Jan 2024 12:29PM - +263 78 289 6783: That sounds amazing ma'am!
299 - 19 Jan 2024 12:29PM - +263 78 289 6783: No ma'am everything is very clear.
300 - 19 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

The life cycle consists of five stages: identify, design, implement, monitor, and optimize. The first stage, identify, involves identifying the current business process and understanding its strengths and weaknesses. The second stage, design, involves creating a new, improved process based on the insights gained in the identify stage. The third stage, implement, involves putting the new process into practice and ensuring that it is running smoothly. The fourth stage, monitor, involves tracking the results of the new process and making any necessary adjustments. Finally, the fifth stage, optimize, involves continuously improving the process based on the feedback and data gathered from the previous stages. By following this life cycle, businesses can create a process that is more efficient, effective, and customer-focused.

Firstly, they provide goods and services that meet the needs of consumers and businesses, thereby increasing the standard of living and boosting economic growth. Secondly, businesses create jobs, which in turn increases income and spending levels, which further fuels economic development. Thirdly, businesses generate tax revenue, which is used by governments to fund public services and infrastructure, further supporting economic development. An example of this is a country like China, which has seen rapid economic development in recent decades due to the growth of businesses such as Alibaba and Tencent. The growth of Alibaba and Tencent, two of China's largest tech companies, has contributed significantly to the country's economic development. Alibaba, which started as an e-commerce platform, has expanded into a variety of other businesses, including cloud computing, logistics, and media. Tencent, which began as a messaging and gaming company, has branched out into online banking, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence. Both companies have created millions of jobs, while also generating significant tax revenue for the Chinese government. Additionally, they have helped other businesses to grow and expand, further driving economic development in China. <This message was edited>

This includes how businesses interact with their employees, customers, suppliers, competitors, and the broader community. It also involves ensuring that companies operate in a legal and fair manner. Business ethics is important because it helps to create trust and credibility for a company. Customers are more likely to do business with a company that they believe is acting ethically, and employees are more likely to be engaged and productive in a company that shares their values. A lack of business ethics can lead to scandals, which can damage a company's reputation and bottom line.

HR plays an important role in attracting and retaining top talent, and it helps to ensure that employees are motivated and productive. Additionally, HR helps to create and maintain a healthy work environment, and it enforces company policies and procedures. Without an effective HR department, an organization may struggle to meet its goals and objectives. For example, without proper recruitment and training, companies may find it difficult to fill key positions and develop a skilled workforce. Therefore, it's clear that HR is an essential part of any successful organizatio.
182 - 19 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Junior. How are you all doing today?
183 - 19 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have taken a note of your answers dear, thank you for sharing them with me.
184 - 19 Jan 2024 10:23AM - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning ma'am
185 - 19 Jan 2024 10:23AM - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you very much
186 - 19 Jan 2024 10:24AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to complete the 1st task that was given to you i.e., fill the SOP form?
208 - 19 Jan 2024 12:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
209 - 19 Jan 2024 12:52PM - +263 71 250 1277: We are together ma'am
210 - 19 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
211 - 19 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
212 - 19 Jan 2024 01:00PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I have
213 - 19 Jan 2024 03:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have taken a note of the fee breakup, Junior. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
214 - 19 Jan 2024 03:52PM - +263 71 250 1277: Yes I am
215 - 19 Jan 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
216 - 19 Jan 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
217 - 19 Jan 2024 03:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.",No,Yes

106 - 19 Jan 2024 11:23AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

217 - 19 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.

This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
218 - 19 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
219 - 19 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
220 - 19 Jan 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
221 - 19 Jan 2024 12:56PM - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
222 - 19 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?

I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
241 - 19 Jan 2024 04:29PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
242 - 19 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
243 - 19 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
247 - 19 Jan 2024 04:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?

249 - 19 Jan 2024 04:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.  In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
250 - 19 Jan 2024 04:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?",No,Yes

195 - 19 Jan 2024 10:19AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to complete the 2nd task?
196 - 19 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 77 838 1040: 2) What are some causes of gas pipeline vibration 20 Carbon steel lines. Answer: When a gas gets to critical flow,sonic booms (producing vibration) is expected.Infact ,one of the main means by which the additional pressure in the pipe is lost.External factors such as wind can cause gas pipeline vibration by vortex shedding from the pipe surface which is a function of wind velocity and wind diameter.If problem exist ,the stiffness and the natural frequency of the piping should be increased by adding bracing ,consistent with still meeting piping  flexibility and associated equipment requirements .Seismic activity can also result in vibrations in steel nearby construction has the ability to cause vibrations .Improper installations or maintanance can also cause vibrations in steel.Earthquakes can cause piping vibrations either directly due to resonance or by the motion of pipe supports or equipment connections.Piping in areas known to experience earthquakesshould be checked for forces due to earthquakes. Acoustically induced vibration which occur in high capacity,gas flow ,pressure reducing systems.Pressure reduction can occur at control valves,at restriction orifices and safety valves.  3)When using a pumping loop to mix two miscible fluids in a tank ,when can the contents be considered well mixed Answer: A rule of thumb is to turn the tank over 3 times and then sample the tank for mixture properties.By "" turn the tank over"",we mean to force the entire volume of the tank through the pump at least 3 times.More turnover may be necessary, but 3 times is a good starting point.The contents may be considered well mixed when there are no visible differences in the fluid and when samples taken from different parts of the tank have the same mixture.  4)Are there any general rules for flushing slurry lines? Answer: Slurry lines should be flushed with a minimum fluid velocity of 10ft/s and the total flushing liquid volume should equal 3-6times the total piping volume.Another option is flushing the pipelines with water however,caution should be taken.Maintanance routines for flushing and a draining of pipelines must be done along with manual cleaning.Pnone wear points must be identified.Use a valve with maximum port size.Use long radius  bends.  5)What is pneumatic conveying Answer: Pneumatic is an efficient means of handling and transporting various types of bulk granular and powder products with minimum loss and at a lower cost than other systems.Pneumatic conveyors can be used for many types of products across a wide range of industries ,including chemicals ,food and beverages and much more. Pneumatic conveying systems use a series of pipeline that move products by pumping air .These products typically consist of powders and granules.These systems function by moving materials through enclosed airtight pipelines through a combination of airflow or another type of gas and pressure.Operators can control positive or negative pressure of airflow to smoothly transfer products without worrying about damage or loss.The are several advantages of pneumating conveying including: -pneumatic conveyors can run long distances either horizontally or vertically. - these systems are easier to locate because they require less floor space. There are also some disadvantages of using pneumatic conveying systems which include:- inability to be used with higher product volumes without some challenges as most pipeline measure from around 3 to 12 inches.
203 - 19 Jan 2024 11:13AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 15 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
204 - 19 Jan 2024 11:33AM - +263 77 838 1040: I have paid an admission of $394
205 - 19 Jan 2024 11:43AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. There has been a confusion from my end, for which I would like to apologize. You are indeed correct, and your enrollment payment has been duly noted by me.
206 - 19 Jan 2024 11:46AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Chemical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
207 - 19 Jan 2024 12:00PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes the information u have is true
208 - 19 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
209 - 19 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
210 - 19 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
211 - 19 Jan 2024 12:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
212 - 19 Jan 2024 12:50PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes it is impossible to study at multiple universities
215 - 19 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
216 - 19 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
217 - 19 Jan 2024 12:55PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes my counselor haa discussed the registration fee during our counseling sessions
218 - 19 Jan 2024 12:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
219 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes we are on the same page
220 - 19 Jan 2024 03:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page, Persevere. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
221 - 19 Jan 2024 04:26PM - +263 77 838 1040: Ok
222 - 19 Jan 2024 04:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
223 - 19 Jan 2024 04:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $2600 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum*  Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $3600). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
224 - 19 Jan 2024 06:11PM - +263 77 838 1040: Well noted
217 - 19 Jan 2024 12:55PM - +263 77 838 1040: Yes my counselor haa discussed the registration fee during our counseling sessions

233 - 19 Jan 2024 11:29AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
234 - 19 Jan 2024 11:29AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
235 - 19 Jan 2024 11:29AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

107 - 19 Jan 2024 03:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that your day is going well. My day has been very eventful as well.
108 - 19 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
110 - 19 Jan 2024 04:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
111 - 19 Jan 2024 04:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
112 - 19 Jan 2024 04:11PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Can you please further explain the second stage
113 - 19 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a very vital document for your application, as it serves as a personalized and comprehensive document that highlights your motivations, qualifications, and goals, providing admissions committees with valuable insights into your application. Since it is a subjective document, your inputs are quite important. After taking your detailed inputs, the Edoofa team will provide assistance in improving or improvising your SOP and then include the same in your application profile. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the same. I hope this was helpful?
114 - 19 Jan 2024 04:18PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes it was
115 - 19 Jan 2024 06:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that it was helpful for you and cleared your query. I apologize for not being able to continue with our discussion today as it was a hectic day with many urgent meetings lined up. My operational hours for the day have concluded and I have had a long day already. Hence, I would love to reconnect with you tomorrow at 10:00 AM to continue with our discussion regarding your admission journey. If the timing is not suitable for you, kindly suggest a more suitable time frame and I will connect with you at that hour. I will be looking forward to it, dear.

133 - 19 Jan 2024 08:50AM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm just going to summarise the key points I managed to note in each video.  In the first video, the founders urged us to be very open minded. They told us that we should be teachable in order to excel in the program. They also said we should be able to follow instructions.  In the second video, they emphasised that Edoofa's vision is not just about giving people affordable education, but it's to guide them to be more employable. They aim to bolster our capacity of success in turn making us as students self dependent and more responsible.  The founders also stressed how they spent a lot of time acquiring a number of good schools and universities. This was done over a period of ten years and they tell us this in the third video. They urged us to follow instructions again to be prepared and qualified for such institutions.  In the fourth and final video, the founders explain what the statement of purpose is. From my understanding, I managed to note that this document is important for convincing institutions to take me on as their student. They also urged us to be prompt in taking action and fill out the form.
134 - 19 Jan 2024 09:08AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! I am glad that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
135 - 19 Jan 2024 09:10AM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, we're on the same page... You may proceed.
136 - 19 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
137 - 19 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.  https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2

As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days.

235 - 19 Jan 2024 10:26AM - +263 78 680 9123: Okay
236 - 19 Jan 2024 10:27AM - Garima Edoofa: Nkosizwile as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*",No,No

178 - 19 Jan 2024 11:19AM - +263 71 921 3646: Yahh I see a great difference from the others and I think I have found what I have been searching for
179 - 19 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
180 - 19 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
181 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm obviously the earn while you learn program is one of a kind
182 - 19 Jan 2024 12:04PM - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.   Alright Takura, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
183 - 19 Jan 2024 12:05PM - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I guess so
193 - 19 Jan 2024 12:21PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
194 - 19 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Garima Edoofa: Takura basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
195 - 19 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
196 - 19 Jan 2024 12:24PM - +263 71 921 3646: Yah I think this is fair
197 - 19 Jan 2024 12:24PM - +263 71 921 3646: It's a very good process I suppose
198 - 19 Jan 2024 01:14PM - Garima Edoofa: Takura, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
199 - 19 Jan 2024 01:18PM - +263 71 921 3646: Uhmm Edoofa gives a learner a chance to minimise his/her payment of the annual fees through the earn while you learn program whereby the learner receives scholarship credits which the amount varies depending with the effort the learner is putting. This has been a great benefit to most of the learners who cover all their tution fees
200 - 19 Jan 2024 01:19PM - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350   *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
201 - 19 Jan 2024 01:20PM - +263 71 921 3646: That's so attractive and interesting
202 - 19 Jan 2024 01:23PM - Garima Edoofa: Yes Takura and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?",No,Yes

233 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
234 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*.

23 - 19 Jan 2024 03:03PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Ashley, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly.

126 - 19 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*\
127 - 19 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4.

Already , significant change in economic development , social relations and governance is being noticed. Approximately eight hundred thousand lives were lost including leaders , teachers and skilled proffesionals which had an impact on economic development.Due to the trauma , communities were torn apart , and trust among ethnic groups were severely wounded. During the genocide , infrastructure such as schools , hospitals , roads and houses were destroyed. The latter hindered the delivery of essential services. Despite the prior situation , Rwanda has been able to make remarkable progress to improve the economy in all sectors . Its progress after the genocide can be attributed to a combination of regional integration , strong leadership , strategic socio-economic development and international cooperation. Economically , Rwanda has experienced significant growth and develepment. The country has a vision aiming to strengthen key sectors such as tourism , services and agriculture , and improve infrastructure. As a result , it has become an attractive destination for foreign investment. Rwanda has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards , although challenges remain , mostly in rural areas. An acceptable level of stability and security has been reached , this has allowed its citizens to live in a safe environment. Efforts to promote unity and reconciliation have been undertaken at both the national and community levels. While challenges remain , progress has been made rebuilding trust. Socially , it has made efforts to empower women and promote gender equality. Women now hold significant roles in politics , business and civil society , which is very brilliant ! Additionally , efforts have been made to promote education and healthcare for all. The cost of living in Rwanda is relatively low compared to other African countries , and the local currency , the Rwandan franc is stable. In terms of health , Rwanda was one of the two countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that achieved all the health Millennium Development Goals (M.D.Gs) , although malaria , HIV and AIDS , and malnutrition are major health issues in Rwanda due to lack of doctors and nurses. Life expectancy at birth is 55,7 years and it is regarded as one of the safest countries to visit in Africa. Life for visitors and tourist is generally positive as Rwanda  is known for its safety and security. Overally , the country offers a unique reward experience for tourist , combining wildlife encounters , cultural experiences and the opportunity to witness the country's inspiring post-genocide transformation.  In conclusion , the genocide is denoted by resilience and impressive progress. Rwanda's transformation serves as an example of how a nation can rebuild and heal after a devastating tragedy.  *SECTION 6* *MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY* Life is a journey filled with ups and downs , and each of us has a special story to tell. In this essay , highlighting the challenges i faced , the lessons i learned and the determination that propelled me forward.  I was born in Zimbabwe into a humble family , surrounded by love but limited resources. Education became my cornerstone of my hope and dreams. I recognized that knowledge had the power to transform lives and break the cycle of poverty. Despite finincial constraints , i pursued education with unwavering determination. I pursued my studies relentlessly , often sacrificing sleep and social activities. I encountered failures and setback that tested my resolve. Yet deep down i knew that success was not measured by the absence of obstacles but by the ability to rise above them. I seat for my O'level in 2021 an i passed with 6As and 4Bs. I slowly began to see the fruits of my labor as opportunities opened up. I then engaged into Advanved level 2022 aiming to study a medical program afterwards , and as usual , i was down to work. At school i was highly disciplined , i exhibited excellent time management skills and i effectively balanced my academic commitments with extracurricular activities like sports. My integrity and ethical conduct made me a role model among my own peers. Being a devoted Christian holding values in my right hand gained me respect within my surroundings. Due to the latter facts presented , i was selected the schools Headboy during my final year in highschool. Recently , the A'level results were released and i had distinctions(As) in all my subjects , Pure Mathematics , Biology and Chemisty. As for now i applied for the Edoofa Program Scholarship and i hope they are going to find me suitable and select me. I'm looking forward to a bright future and i will continue being a hardworker in all areas of my life. In my pursuit of success , i am humbled by the challenges i overcame and the growth i experienced. I hope that through sharing my inspirational journey , i can inspire other to embrace their own unique path.

2 - 19 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Chisomo Banda!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 19 Jan 2024 10:42AM - +260 97 3642584: Edoofa is a scholarship program that is Merit based, this means that they range from distinctions to Merits in terms of acceptance at the universities where your applications will be sent to. It's not a sponsorship based program but a scholarship based program.
4 - 19 Jan 2024 11:06AM - +260 97 3642584: it is a 50% scholarship program , with good benefits provided by it through the Earn While You Learn program (ewyl).
5 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
6 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
7 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
8 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
9 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10 - 19 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13 - 19 Jan 2024 01:11PM - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir
14 - 19 Jan 2024 01:11PM - +260 97 3642584: It is
15 - 19 Jan 2024 02:45PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Chisomo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16 - 19 Jan 2024 02:50PM - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir I have what it takes
17 - 19 Jan 2024 03:23PM - Gurvinder: Now Chisomo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

12 - 19 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13 - 19 Jan 2024 01:11PM - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir

15 - 19 Jan 2024 02:45PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Chisomo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16 - 19 Jan 2024 02:50PM - +260 97 3642584: Yes sir I have what it takes
17 - 19 Jan 2024 03:23PM - Gurvinder: Now Chisomo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

127 - 19 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
128 - 19 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

206 - 18 Jan 2024 11:47PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
207 - 19 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!  *“Your efforts matter, your dreams are worth pursuing, and you have the power to make a positive impact. ""*  Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference
208 - 19 Jan 2024 11:58AM - +263 77 282 8719: Oky sir
209 - 19 Jan 2024 01:53PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
210 - 19 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: Jupiter basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
211 - 19 Jan 2024 01:54PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
212 - 19 Jan 2024 09:23PM - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.  I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.",No,No

3 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Katongo Martha Mwila!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
4 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - +260 96 8297698: I haven't really understood much about the program all I know is that the edoofa schoolarship is meant to help those who are interested in studying from India
5 - 19 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
6 - 19 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
7 - 19 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

8 - 19 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
9 - 19 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

12 - 19 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13 - 19 Jan 2024 02:21PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes sir this is exactly what I'm looking for.
14 - 19 Jan 2024 03:06PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Katongo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15 - 19 Jan 2024 03:12PM - +260 96 8297698: Yes I do.
16 - 19 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Gurvinder: Now Katongo, I would like to know you better as a student.

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?
203 - 18 Jan 2024 04:13PM - +263 71 574 2762: I do agree and it sounds like a great opportunity for international students.

207 - 19 Jan 2024 12:07PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
208 - 19 Jan 2024 12:08PM - Gurvinder: Lavender basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
209 - 19 Jan 2024 12:08PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
210 - 19 Jan 2024 08:15PM - +263 71 574 2762: I think the flexible fee payment policy is a brilliant idea, and it has the potential to open up the Program to even more students who might otherwise not have been able to participate
211 - 19 Jan 2024 09:14PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

40 - 19 Jan 2024 10:17AM - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon, I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa.  I am here to continue your application and help you become a part of the Edoofa family.
41 - 19 Jan 2024 10:18AM - +260 779696856: Good morning sir Thank you
42 - 19 Jan 2024 12:20PM - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
43 - 19 Jan 2024 01:45PM - +260 779696856: Yes sir
44 - 19 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
45 - 19 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
46 - 19 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*

53 - 19 Jan 2024 02:46PM - Gurvinder: Okay so @260779696856, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

2 - 19 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mulenga Shelly!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 19 Jan 2024 10:37AM - +260 97 3157882: Thank you
4 - 19 Jan 2024 10:38AM - +260 97 3157882: It's a  program that offers Scholarships to all in India
5 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you clearly.
6 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
7 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
8 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
9 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

12 - 19 Jan 2024 12:29PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

14 - 19 Jan 2024 02:24PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Shelly, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15 - 19 Jan 2024 02:26PM - +260 97 3157882: Yes I do

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
216 - 19 Jan 2024 01:57PM - +263 77 134 5675: Yes I'm ready
217 - 19 Jan 2024 02:46PM - Gurvinder: @263771345675 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
218 - 19 Jan 2024 03:08PM - +263 77 134 5675: It will be about $1500-$2250
219 - 19 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Gurvinder: Exactly @263771345675 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

7 - 19 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program clearly.
8 - 19 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
9 - 19 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

10 - 19 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
11 - 19 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

16 - 19 Jan 2024 03:10PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Natasha, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17 - 19 Jan 2024 03:15PM - +260 774113578: Yes I do
18 - 19 Jan 2024 03:17PM - +260 774113578: Am more than sure that my parents and I will be of service sir

In Zimbabwe our medical facilities are poor and according to my research they are few Radiographers hence people have to go outside the country to try access these facilities which is expensive. So I wish to study this course in Radiography and open some centres that are cheap and accessible and also work hand in hand with hospitals as an helping hand In my country especially  in my town.

From hematology to clinical chemistry, you'll gain expertise in diverse areas crucial for accurate diagnostics. 2. Versatility in Lab Operations:  MLT equips you with a versatile skill set, making you proficient in handling a wide range of laboratory tests. This versatility is invaluable when setting up a lab as it allows you to offer a comprehensive suite of diagnostic services. 3. Entrepreneurial Edge:  Aspiring to open labs requires more than technical know-how; it demands an entrepreneurial edge. MLT not only imparts technical skills but also nurtures a mindset to manage and grow a successful laboratory business. 4. Meeting Local Healthcare Needs:  Labs are fundamental to healthcare, and by specializing in MLT, you'll be contributing directly to meeting local healthcare needs. Understanding the specific health challenges in our country will enable you to tailor your services accordingly. 5. Adaptable to Emerging Trends:  The field of MLT is dynamic and evolves with advancements in medical technology. Your education will keep you abreast of the latest trends, ensuring that your labs stay at the forefront of diagnostic innovation. 6. Community Impact:  Opening labs isn't just a business venture; it's a chance to make a real impact on the health and well-being of our community.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

2 - 19 Jan 2024 10:29AM - +260 97 3209479: Hello
3 - 19 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Pelekelo Kapumo!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
4 - 19 Jan 2024 10:34AM - +260 97 3209479: From my understanding, I think the Edoofa scholarship program is about helping deserving students who might not be able to pay for their college/university tuition fees while creating equality while doing it by making it available for different people regardless of their race
5 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
6 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
7 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
8 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
9 - 19 Jan 2024 12:17PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

12 - 19 Jan 2024 12:18PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13 - 19 Jan 2024 12:45PM - +260 97 3209479: Yes it definitely is
14 - 19 Jan 2024 02:31PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nambwae, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.

15 - 19 Jan 2024 02:55PM - +260 97 3209479: Yes I do but my parents are deceased so my sisters are my legal guardians
16 - 19 Jan 2024 03:24PM - Gurvinder: Now Nambwae, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3.

2 - 19 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Zangi Lizu!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 19 Jan 2024 10:36AM - +260 96 1900423: Thank you for the opportunity. Edoofa stands for Affordable Higher education options in India for international students to help deserving students tackle the problem of lack of affordability and employability in  college education
4 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
5 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 19 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

11 - 19 Jan 2024 12:26PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12 - 19 Jan 2024 01:13PM - +260 96 1900423: It's impressive to see edoofa's  commitment to providing quality education and employability skills through its scorlaships and the earn will you learn  program. I am indeed  interested in a scorlaship opportunity to further my education by helping my parents reduce the financial burden.
13 - 19 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Zangi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
14 - 19 Jan 2024 03:09PM - +260 96 1900423: Thank you for providing the details about the scholarship criteria. I am committed to being proactive in the counseling sessions and ensuring my parents' active participation in the process to maximize the chances of securing a higher scholarship. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to the counseling sessions.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5.

It is mostly known for its incredible breathtaking scenary. It is oftenly refered to as the land of a thousand hills or as they call it in French ""le pays des mille collines.""  Now Sixteen years after genocide, Rwanda has emerged as a nation focused on healing, reconstruction, and sustainable development. The scars of the 1994 genocide are not forgotten, but the resilience of the Rwandan people has paved the way for a renewed sense of national identity and progress.  Reconciliation has been a cornerstone of Rwanda's journey. The government's commitment to justice through the Gacaca courts has played a vital role in addressing the atrocities of the past while fostering community healing. The emphasis on unity and rebuilding social bonds has created a more cohesive society, even as survivors and perpetrators coexist in shared communities. This commitment to reconciliation has been crucial in shaping the social fabric of contemporary Rwanda.  Economically, Rwanda has experienced a significant transformation. The government's strategic vision has focused on diversifying the economy and investing in key sectors. The capital city, Kigali, now stands as a testament to this economic shift, with modern infrastructure, thriving businesses, and a burgeoning tech scene. Agricultural reforms have also contributed to economic growth, ensuring sustainable practices and increased productivity.  Education has been a priority for Rwanda's leadership, recognizing it as a catalyst for societal change. Efforts to improve access to education and enhance the quality of learning have resulted in a more educated and informed populace. The focus on education extends beyond academics, promoting values of unity, tolerance, and critical thinking, laying the foundation for a brighter future.  Environmental sustainability has become a central concern for Rwanda. The country has actively engaged in initiatives to preserve its rich biodiversity and combat environmental degradation. Tree planting campaigns and conservation efforts showcase a commitment to responsible stewardship of the natural resources that are crucial for the nation's long-term well-being.  Socially, Rwanda has made strides in gender equality and inclusivity. Women's participation in various sectors, including politics and business, has increased, contributing to a more balanced and equitable society. Initiatives to support survivors of the genocide and address mental health challenges have been instrumental in the healing process, though the psychological scars of such a traumatic past remain a poignant aspect of daily life for many.  Challenges persist, reminding Rwanda that the journey to lasting recovery is ongoing. Economic disparities, the need for continued reconciliation, and the importance of addressing mental health issues underscore the complexities of the post-genocide landscape. However, the nation's progress is undeniable, and the world looks to Rwanda as a beacon of hope and resilience.  In conclusion, life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, is marked by a commitment to various aspects such as reconciliation, economic growth, educational advancement, environmental sustainability, and social inclusivity. While challenges persist, the nation's transformative journey stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of its people and their collective determination to build a more prosperous and harmonious future.

156 - 19 Jan 2024 01:25PM - Keshav Edoofa: Tendai as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
157 - 19 Jan 2024 01:29PM - +263 78 832 2888: $1500-$2250
158 - 19 Jan 2024 01:30PM - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tendai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.",No,No

This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program  *Enrollment fee* For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together

124 - 19 Jan 2024 10:36AM - Kunal: Alright please I have also noted that Joseph is well motivated towards this career path in Medicine and looking forward to excelling in it  What motivated him towards this career goal?
125 - 19 Jan 2024 11:39AM - +265 991 59 81 60: I have been discussing with Joseph on why he has a strong passion to study medicine. The first response was his compassion for the sick struggling to raise money for special medical attention .This motivated Joseph to love sciences and mathematics and made him study hard to pass with distinctions. He understands fully the need to do well in sciences for him to be a surgeon. And that helping sick people indefatigably   requires hard working spirit and a compassionate heart.
126 - 19 Jan 2024 11:51AM - +265 991 59 81 60: I can testify as a parent that to study medicine is not an impulse decision to Joseph but part of his long term plan. All his academic studies is meant to achieve this goal of becoming a surgeon  help the sick in need of specialized attention.
127 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Kunal: It's truly inspiring to learn about Joseph's strong passion for studying medicine. His initial motivation, driven by compassion for those struggling to afford special medical attention, speaks volumes about his empathy and dedication It's evident that Joseph's motivation goes beyond personal success, focusing on making a positive impact on the lives of others.

226 - 19 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 78 782 8606: l think on the 23rd of January
227 - 19 Jan 2024 10:58AM - Kunal: Noted Joseph You must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
228 - 19 Jan 2024 11:01AM - +263 78 782 8606: 2
229 - 19 Jan 2024 11:03AM - Kunal: Joseph, basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student range between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.",No,No

169 - 19 Jan 2024 11:54AM - Kunal: That's completely understandable, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.  So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
170 - 19 Jan 2024 12:07PM - +260 769204539: Happy.
171 - 19 Jan 2024 12:09PM - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
172 - 19 Jan 2024 12:09PM - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
173 - 19 Jan 2024 12:14PM - +260 769204539: No.
175 - 19 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

182 - 19 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their Grade 12 result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
183 - 19 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
184 - 19 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*",No,No

128 - 19 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Kunal: Indeed, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?

131 - 19 Jan 2024 02:30PM - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

189 - 19 Jan 2024 11:38AM - Kunal: That is fine Can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will he/she be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?  5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

144 - 19 Jan 2024 10:57AM - +260 97 3182542: Okay I have seen them
145 - 19 Jan 2024 11:12AM - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
146 - 19 Jan 2024 11:14AM - +260 97 3182542: Sure that's interesting

148 - 19 Jan 2024 11:31AM - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
149 - 19 Jan 2024 11:34AM - +260 97 3182542: U gave me this already

153 - 19 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Pallika Edoofa: Bwalaya, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program!  The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment  The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors  1) Academic Excellence 2) Merit 3) Previous Experiences 4) Recommendations from Edoofa 5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 6) Extracurricular Activities  So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
154 - 19 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Pallika Edoofa: And, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.  They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.  But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee *(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
185 - 19 Jan 2024 12:55PM - +260 97 3182542: Alright

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
61 - 18 Jan 2024 04:37PM - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

93 - 19 Jan 2024 02:33PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Evelyn, Continuing the session, As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible for Nursing. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as  1) *Bachelor of Physiotherapy* 2) *Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 3) *Bachelor of Pharmacy* 4) *Bachelor of Optometry* 5) *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology* etc  Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
94 - 19 Jan 2024 02:35PM - +265 887 19 00 12: Bachelor in physiotherapy
95 - 19 Jan 2024 02:35PM - +265 887 19 00 12: Yes this one can you explain a bit more about this could course

101 - 19 Jan 2024 04:03PM - Pallika Edoofa: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
102 - 19 Jan 2024 04:07PM - +265 887 19 00 12: I didn't get the question, can you explain
103 - 19 Jan 2024 04:10PM - Pallika Edoofa: Evelyn, I was asking that after pursuing this course, where you see yourself in the next 5 years!

128 - 19 Jan 2024 10:08AM - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

150 - 19 Jan 2024 11:09AM - +263 78 252 5938: It is a privilege let alone an achievements as a parent to open up your child

152 - 19 Jan 2024 11:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.

155 - 19 Jan 2024 11:59AM - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

165 - 19 Jan 2024 02:26PM - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
166 - 19 Jan 2024 02:26PM - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*

167 - 19 Jan 2024 02:26PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
168 - 19 Jan 2024 02:30PM - +263 78 252 5938: So you saying l pay before getting a place at University
169 - 19 Jan 2024 02:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me explain Mr. Ncube, a student only pays the enrollment fee if they are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, because if they are found eligible then they would have a guarantee of admission under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
170 - 19 Jan 2024 02:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: Since in further discussion I would be briefing you about what happens in further stages of a student, and  you will understand how Edoofa's process is different as compared to any international application process.

149 - 19 Jan 2024 09:58AM - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
160 - 19 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Pallika Edoofa: Well, We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.  *Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.  *Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with steps 5 and 6. So shall I explain them to you?
161 - 19 Jan 2024 10:33AM - +263 78 448 1458: Yes
162 - 19 Jan 2024 10:34AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
163 - 19 Jan 2024 10:34AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
172 - 19 Jan 2024 12:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

17 - 19 Jan 2024 09:57AM - +263 78 252 0686: Thank you for the opportunity but l would like to make a request that you may terminate my application

22 - 19 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?

24 - 19 Jan 2024 11:58AM - Pallika Edoofa: See, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.

25 - 19 Jan 2024 11:58AM - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
26 - 19 Jan 2024 12:15PM - +263 78 252 0686: Thank you so much but with law program it has to be done in Zimbabwe because they don't recognize any other law degree from other countries so if l practice outside when l come back here l have to write another exams for me to be able to practice
27 - 19 Jan 2024 12:32PM - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwa, I understand the importance of pursuing your law program in Zimbabwe due to local recognition. However, keep in mind that obtaining a law degree in India can offer you global recognition. With an internationally recognized degree, you may have the flexibility to practice law in various parts of the world without the need for additional exams upon your return to Zimbabwe. It's worth exploring the possibilities that an Indian law degree can provide for your future career aspirations.

112 - 19 Jan 2024 09:47AM - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families. <This message was edited>

115 - 19 Jan 2024 10:34AM - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

288 - 19 Jan 2024 10:55AM - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants.

370 - 19 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.",No,No

20 - 19 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

279 - 18 Jan 2024 08:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. To pursue a career in radiology, it is essential to have a strong foundation in biology during your A-level studies. Radiology involves the use of medical imaging techniques to diagnose and treat various medical conditions, and a comprehensive understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and pathology, which are covered in biology, is crucial for success in this field. Having a background in biology provides the necessary knowledge to interpret medical images accurately, understand the underlying physiological processes, and effectively communicate with other healthcare professionals. Therefore, including biology in your A-level coursework ensures that you acquire the fundamental skills and knowledge required for a successful career in radiology! <This message was edited>
280 - 19 Jan 2024 04:57AM - +263 78 088 4277: Where I am from for you to pursue radiology, at Alevel you have to study Maths and Chem,Bio or Physics. So I was really looking forward to radiology because that is what I want. To be honest engineering is a good department but it does not thrill me. I don't want to regret later in life for doing something I honestly have no interest in. So if radiology is out of reach, I am not turning down your offer but I want to try and get the course that i want.
281 - 19 Jan 2024 09:10AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what intrigues you regarding Radiology, please? Furthermore, Could you kindly provide me with a comprehensive overview of your research on the course and its future prospects and relevancy in the ever-growing job landscape, please?
282 - 19 Jan 2024 01:06PM - +263 78 088 4277: Radiology is the science of studying human anatomy using advanced machinery. Being able to study what is causing illness and also diagnose is an amazing job because I will be saving lives. Also isn't it exciting to be among the people fighting cancer by detecting it to save lives. This is a good course with many career opportunities like radiologist, ultrasound technician and MRI technician. These are really good professions and I find interest in the MRI department. I want to be a great radiologist who assists people in need and not someone who discovers things in the engineering departments some that will not be for the greater good of everyone like Dr Oppenheimer whose bomb destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki all in the name of duty and achieving greatness in his work.
283 - 19 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. May I know whether you are interested in pharmacy, please?
284 - 19 Jan 2024 02:02PM - +263 78 088 4277: Pharmacy is a good program but if I was offered radiology I would be thrilled.
285 - 19 Jan 2024 02:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: While the allure of a pharmacy program is undoubtedly commendable, it's essential to recognize that radiology, being a highly specialized field, demands a specific set of prerequisites. Biology, with its in-depth understanding of human anatomy and physiology, forms the very foundation of radiology. Unfortunately, your current subject combination may not align with the prerequisites for radiology, potentially limiting the eligibility for pursuing this program. While the prospect of radiology might be thrilling, considering your subject combination, it's crucial to explore alternative paths that align with your interests and qualifications. Pharmacy, with its focus on medications and patient care, remains an excellent and promising choice, offering diverse opportunities to contribute to healthcare. Embracing pharmacy not only ensures eligibility but also provides a meaningful avenue to make a positive impact in the healthcare sector. Your passion for the medical field can still be channeled into a fulfilling career, and pharmacy stands as a valuable and accessible route toward achieving your goals, Tanaka!
278 - 18 Jan 2024 08:26PM - +263 78 088 4277: You mentioned that I should have done biology but I did it at O'level.
279 - 18 Jan 2024 08:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tanaka. To pursue a career in radiology, it is essential to have a strong foundation in biology during your A-level studies. Radiology involves the use of medical imaging techniques to diagnose and treat various medical conditions, and a comprehensive understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and pathology, which are covered in biology, is crucial for success in this field. Having a background in biology provides the necessary knowledge to interpret medical images accurately, understand the underlying physiological processes, and effectively communicate with other healthcare professionals. Therefore, including biology in your A-level coursework ensures that you acquire the fundamental skills and knowledge required for a successful career in radiology! <This message was edited>

288 - 19 Jan 2024 02:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The University Grants Commission (UGC) in many countries, including India, sets stringent criteria for pursuing medicine to ensure that students entering medical programs possess a strong foundation in relevant subjects. The criteria typically include a combination of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology as mandatory subjects, rather than Mathematics, Tanaka. <This message was edited>
289 - 19 Jan 2024 02:38PM - +263 78 088 4277: Maybe it's in my region where it is essential because radiology has a lot of calculations and Mathematics is always required

The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.  Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
148 - 18 Jan 2024 09:44PM - +263 78 069 4460: That's true sir the situation is not pleasing  at all. Therefore, it's not  my wish to get such type of degree .

152 - 19 Jan 2024 09:20AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Yolanda!
153 - 19 Jan 2024 09:20AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Yolanda. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.  With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.  So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
154 - 19 Jan 2024 09:31AM - +263 77 746 9271: Yes sir guide me
155 - 19 Jan 2024 09:39AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Marvellous. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
156 - 19 Jan 2024 09:39AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
209 - 19 Jan 2024 12:02PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

213 - 19 Jan 2024 12:19PM - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir thank you for the information.
214 - 19 Jan 2024 01:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
215 - 19 Jan 2024 01:09PM - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir I understand thank you
216 - 19 Jan 2024 01:18PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
217 - 19 Jan 2024 01:44PM - +263 78 069 4460: Okay sir I understood that   there are options which were brought forward by Edoofa to reduce the burden of enrollment fee through making parents pay in installments . I also understood that t  Edoofa created programs through which students may help ease financial strain from their parents such as the Earn While You Learn program. I also learnt that Edoofa help students to create the statement of purpose . Edoofa also support students through Visa documentation Assistance, University selection and seels learning center  classes of which individuals who do not have support of Edoofa will need to face the expenses all alone.
218 - 19 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
230 - 19 Jan 2024 02:26PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

148 - 19 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mordecai. To pursue a course in architecture, it is imperative for students to meet the minimum academic requirements, typically comprising Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics in their A-Level studies. These subjects form the foundational knowledge base essential for understanding the principles of architecture and design. Physics provides insights into structural mechanics and material properties, Chemistry contributes to an understanding of construction materials and their interactions, while Mathematics is fundamental for complex calculations and spatial reasoning in architectural planning. This combination ensures that students have the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in the multidisciplinary field of architecture, encompassing both the scientific and creative aspects of the profession, Mordecai! <This message was edited>

This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

194 - 19 Jan 2024 11:25AM - +263 71 300 2882: India opens many opportunities, offers many benefits and affordable when learning. In pursuit of one's career these would definitely aid me in paving the best path for my career.  Through rigorous training and dedication I would claim my post as a technologist.
195 - 19 Jan 2024 12:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?

198 - 19 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Victor! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

357 - 19 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
358 - 19 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
359 - 19 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

361 - 19 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 25th or 26th January 2024 for $200 and the 25th or 26th of February for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 24th or 25th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

105 - 19 Jan 2024 09:34AM - +263 71 478 0540: Becoming a lawyer is a rewarding and challenging career path that requires dedication and a strong commitment to justice. Here are some steps you can take to pursue a career in law:  1. Education: Start by earning a bachelor's degree in a relevant field, such as political science, history, or pre-law. While there is no specific undergraduate major required for law school, it is important to develop strong critical thinking, research, and communication skills.  2.
