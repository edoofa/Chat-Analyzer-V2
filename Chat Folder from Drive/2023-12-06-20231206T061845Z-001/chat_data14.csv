As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.  During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.  Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.  Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.  *Deadline: 04/12/2023*

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting this week, we will only connect on Saturdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.  📅 Saturday, 9th December: *EWYL group session at 7:00 PM*  📅 Saturday, 16th December: *Group Call*  📅 Saturday, 23rd December: *EWYL group session at 7:00 PM*  📅 Saturday, 30th December:: *Group Call*

I hope to see you on time! ⏰

328 - 05 Dec 2023 03:48PM - +91 90535 45665: Since I have started my EWYL project I have talked to at least 12 people so far about edoofa . Due to the fact that I learnt at boarding schools for a long time since 2016 affected my community building project because I didn't really have anyone I know in my area and most of whom I knew before had moved to other cities and had lost contact. There are many Students from my former school who enrolled here through edoofa including me and spreading the news that is already out at my former school is hard and this has affected my community building project. However when I talked to Mr Mukundi he said there is a possibility that Out of a hundred people that you talk to only about 5 may come to India so this has made my spirit to thrive to burn ❤️‍🔥 till now . I analysed that due to the rumour that are being spread about bad scholarship programs in Zimbabwe that dump children here in India it has affected the rate of students taking admission here . However I have a goal of making Better memories and greater success through videos and pictures that I would be able to share with people of my country or other African countries that can be able to convince them to take part in this wonderful program

237 - 05 Dec 2023 09:50AM - +91 79737 30374: *Saturday Activity*  EWYL is an initiative  that allows students to gain Scholarship as a way to help reduce their cost if Education.  One of the most enlightenment project i did isCommunity Building. It involves enlightening and finding potential students who are willing to study in india through various techniques like meeting school heads, social media and also physical meeting with the peers. It involves telling students or parents the enrollment and eligibility processes of being an Edoofian.  During this course i managed to conduct it and i faced challenges of some students doubting the organisation and i learnt to provide maximum possible information to deliver to them about the program like giving them social media handles like FB and IG so that they can navigate and see some proud students acquiring their quality education abroad.  I use my experience as proof viability of Edoofa program  I hope in January I'm going to have many students for that's time of receiving their a level results

459 - 05 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Ananya Edoofa: My journey as an Edoofian was quiet interesting.l joined Edoofa in August 2022 and EDOOFA IS A FAMILY OF LOVE.lt is actually a good scholarship program to help all the African students,as well it is a 50% scholarship but with good benefits provided by it through the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM. The Earn While You Learn Program is a project introduced by EDOOFA to help us students to get credits on  our own with the help of our project mentors to raise fees in order to cut the costs for our parents and guardians. We do all these tasks with the help of our mentors. These projects are very helpful to us students in the sense that,they helps us to develop the leadership skills like hardworking,punctuality,confidence and good communication skills, moreover each week we do online webinars with different motivational speakers,the webinars are very important to us as the stories shared are very inspiring. Our mentors are not only for the projects but they are also our guardians here as we are too far away from home.We share our problems with them and they always offer good solutions to us.l still remember last month l suffered from fever due to the change of environment,Edoofa managed to stand with me till l recovered.  These projects are done from the first year semester up until you finish your course. So while l was still in Zimbabwe l managed to do quite well in my projects and my credits are increasing.
460 - 05 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Ananya Edoofa: Goodafternoon Parents,coming back to my story……….Studying abroad in lndia has some benefits, 1.You have an opportunity to meet new friends from different countries like Zambia,South Africa and Tanzania etc hence an advantage to learn new cultural practices and languages.As for me lam now connected to some students from lndia,Zambia and Cameroon and lam finding it helpful to me.The lndians are teaching me their language that is Hindi 2.Free internet connection is available in lndia,each day you get your 2GB data,you call for free at anytime you just feel like calling your local friends 3.The economy is very stable,goods and services are bought at a lower costs,all things are very cheap be it food,clothes,books and blankets etc 4.Water in lndia is for free there is no need to pay for it and it is always available ,you wash and bath as many times as you want,you won’t be charged 5.A chance also to explore new things,like the electric buses and trains ,,,visiting the Malls 6.lndia have the best Universities and hardworking members of the faculties ,no student is allowed to miss the classes,there is a rule in each University which says that each student must maintain 75% attendance and failure to do that will not be allowed to seat for the examinations and will be expelled from the school,hence it is a benefit as we are being taught to be hardworkers and to be always punctual,if a student is late for the lesson he or she will not be allowed to enter the classroom.As for me lam seeing that it is a very good thing as this doesn’t promote laziness but hardworkers and making us not to forget the purpose of leaving our country coming abroad.  So as an lnternational student lam really enjoying,lam staying outside the campus……To get the accommodation l was helped by Edoofa and lam staying close to my university,no need for transport l just walk.Mr.Mukund the head of department from Edoofa is always at our school,he is our guardian,he is the one we tell all our problems anytime when we are at school.He is a hardworking man.",No,Yes

272 - 05 Dec 2023 08:34AM - +91 77175 56230: Well the EWYL journey was not as easy as expected but we're hoping for the best in the future.  Convincing people to be part of Edoofa has been really challenging, some students already know this scholarship program and are not interested. Some students wish to study elsewhere other than India, for example someone enquired if Edoofa offers scholarship to other countries like Poland.  The main issue with the students that I submitted their applications and are no longer responding is because some told me that, the everyday sessions are boring and they can't keep up with that . Some are not financially stable, they are orphans and they were expecting 100% scholarships which are not offered here.  However, some of the students I submitted were willing to undergo this process to come this side and some are still coming to my inbox seeking advice on the EWYL projects.  So this experience has been like a rollercoaster .Now we are just hoping for the best ...

This essay provides a small analysis of the input and output of the project, highlighting the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of the efforts. Furthermore, it explores potential improvements for future projects, setting goals for personal and academic development.  Input Analysis: The input for the scholarship enrollment project consisted of identifying potential students who met the eligibility criteria. This involved conducting extensive research, reaching out to educational institutions, and utilizing various platforms to spread awareness about the scholarship program. The input also included designing and implementing an application process to evaluate the candidates' qualifications.  Challenges Faced: 1. Limited pool of potential students: One of the major challenges encountered was the limited number of eligible students who met the scholarship criteria. This restricted the overall impact of the project, as only six potential students were identified.  2. Lack of awareness: Despite efforts to spread awareness about the scholarship program, there was a lack of visibility among the target audience. This hindered the enrollment process and limited the number of applications received.  3. Evaluation process: Developing an effective evaluation process to assess the candidates' qualifications proved to be challenging. Ensuring fairness and transparency while considering various factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and financial need required careful consideration.  Lessons Learned: 1. Importance of early planning: The project highlighted the significance of early planning and setting realistic goals. Starting the enrollment process well in advance would have allowed for a wider reach and increased the chances of identifying more potential students.  2. Effective communication strategies: The project emphasized the need for diverse and effective communication strategies to reach the target audience. Utilizing social media platforms, collaborating with educational institutions, and engaging with community organizations could have improved awareness and enrollment.  3. Streamlining the evaluation process: The project shed light on the importance of streamlining the evaluation process. Developing clear criteria and guidelines for assessing candidates' qualifications would have facilitated a more efficient and fair selection process.  Overall Impact: Despite the challenges faced, the scholarship enrollment project had a positive impact on the lives of the six potential students who were identified. By providing financial support and opportunities for higher education, the project aimed to empower these students and contribute to their personal and academic growth. The impact of the project extended beyond the immediate beneficiaries, as it also raised awareness about the importance of scholarships and education within the community.  Improvement Goals: 1. Enhanced outreach strategies: In future projects, it is crucial to develop more comprehensive and targeted outreach strategies. Collaborating with local organizations, leveraging social media influencers, and conducting awareness campaigns in schools and colleges can help reach a wider audience.  2. Strengthening partnerships: Building strong partnerships with educational institutions, community organizations, and local businesses can enhance the visibility and credibility of the scholarship program.  3. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the enrollment process and making necessary improvements is essential. Collecting feedback from applicants, monitoring the impact of the scholarship program, and adapting strategies accordingly will ensure continuous growth and success.  Conclusion: The analysis of the input and output of the scholarship enrollment project highlights the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of the efforts. Despite the limited number of potential students identified, the project successfully provided opportunities for higher education to six deserving individuals. By reflecting on the project's shortcomings and setting improvement goals, future projects can be more effective in reaching a larger audience and making a greater impact.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting this week, we will only connect on Saturdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.  📅 Saturday, 9th December: *EWYL group session at 7:00 PM*  📅 Saturday, 16th December: *Group Call*  📅 Saturday, 23rd December: *EWYL group session at 7:00 PM*  📅 Saturday, 30th December:: *Group Call*
348 - 05 Dec 2023 03:18PM - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I am ready to take a step ahead by considering and respecting your time and schedule. I expect you to reciprocate the same and attend the calls. Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you on time! ⏰

195 - 05 Dec 2023 08:36AM - +263 77 196 6236: What a funny fact 😅
196 - 05 Dec 2023 08:43AM - Ananya Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director. The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
197 - 05 Dec 2023 08:45AM - +263 77 196 6236: Okay noted
198 - 05 Dec 2023 08:48AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to find out the contact number of your school head?
202 - 05 Dec 2023 08:52AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
203 - 05 Dec 2023 08:52AM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

157 - 05 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Sharda Edoofa: Sure.
158 - 05 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.  I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
159 - 05 Dec 2023 12:31PM - +263 71 449 1907: Yes l agree with you there
160 - 05 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
161 - 05 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.   Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

156 - 05 Dec 2023 11:24AM - +263 71 449 1907: Could you please explain to me question number 2. I seem kind of lost
157 - 05 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Sharda Edoofa: Sure.
158 - 05 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.  I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
159 - 05 Dec 2023 12:31PM - +263 71 449 1907: Yes l agree with you there
160 - 05 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
161 - 05 Dec 2023 12:52PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.   Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.  I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.  I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?

166 - 05 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
167 - 05 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.
168 - 05 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Sharda Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
169 - 05 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Sharda Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
172 - 05 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Sharda Edoofa: *School Details*:  1. School Name: 2. School Province: 3. Name of the contact person: 4. Designation of the contact person: 5. Whatsapp Number: 6. Year of the establishment of the School: 7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 8. No. of teachers in School: 9. The number of students in A level: 10. Fee structure in A level (Per Term in USD): 11. Date of Call: 12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):    *Details submitted by*: 1. Full Name: 2. EWYL Group Name: 3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
173 - 05 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
174 - 05 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
175 - 05 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.  During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.  Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.  Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.  Best Regards TEAM EWYL!

This project is like our student's favorite project as it gives them an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. As part of this project, you will reach out to local schools in your region and you will and headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program.  So initially what you can do is you can make a list of all the higher secondary schools in your local area. You can start with your own school, connect with the principal of your school and you can tell them maybe over WhatsApp or a call about why you joined Edoofa in the first place. You can later tell them about how you have planned your future and then share the program details with them. After this, you could simply ask them if you would like to set up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director where both of them can explore synergies.  After this, you can then share the contact details of the principal with your EWYL mentor in the format that shall be provided to you. As you know that in this project you have to reach out to schools and arrange a meeting between the school headmaster and the Edoofa program director,  We have tried to come up with an Edoofa cover letter that you can use to initiate a conversation with your principal or headmaster. I shall now be sending it to you after this audio. Thank you and all the best on this project.

223 - 05 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
224 - 05 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +263 78 129 8755: yes i agree
225 - 05 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
226 - 05 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.   Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
227 - 05 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_  I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.  I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.  I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?

167 - 05 Dec 2023 01:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263781542433. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
168 - 05 Dec 2023 01:03PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

451 - 05 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in response Natasha, I had an unexpected call because of this I couldn't attend to your message. Also, addressing the messages shared by you earlier Natasha, I did not get you well regarding the query you shared for the refund? Your application for a scholarship has already been processed after which you were able to secure your scholarship seat and hold the same till you complete your remaining formalities and hence it is non refundable as per the procedures. May I know what happened because of which you had the same query?
452 - 05 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: While you share your response to the same, let me address your query regarding the payment modes. If you are planning to make the payment from South Africa in rands, there are two modes available -  1. Telegraphic Transfer - If you have an International Nostro Bank Account or a Visa Card, using the same you would be able to make the deposit directly to India. The details of the same are mentioned in your offer letter and you can use those. The transfer charges for the Telegraphic Transfer will be notified to you by the bank you use.  2. Mama Money - If you are planning to make the payment in Rands, that can be done using Mama Money. The transfer charges for the same mode is zero percentage and hence this is the most feasible mode in case one plans to make the payment from South Africa. For this mode, we will share a Mama Money Order and using the reference id mentioned in the same, you will be able to make the deposit in cash at any of the Mama Money stores in your locality.
453 - 05 Dec 2023 06:13PM - +263 77 356 4124: Okay will tell him
454 - 05 Dec 2023 06:14PM - +263 77 356 4124: Ma parents where asking if they cant pay the money so it's a loss for them right
455 - 05 Dec 2023 06:26PM - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your thoughts dear, however I believe your parents are now ready to make the payment, is that correct?
457 - 05 Dec 2023 06:37PM - +263 77 356 4124: Whilst he is in South Africa
458 - 05 Dec 2023 06:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear. As we have shared above about the mode of payment your father can use in order to make the payment while he is South Africa. Let me reshare them with you.  1. Telegraphic Transfer - If you have an International Nostro Bank Account or a Visa Card, using the same you would be able to make the deposit directly to India. The details of the same are mentioned in your offer letter and you can use those. The transfer charges for the Telegraphic Transfer will be notified to you by the bank you use.  2.

Hence this helps us to know the performance of our daughter it's not about the leaning aboard issue but having assurance of the capacity of our daughter in handling tertiary education. Secondly we are still working on issues of fees and other financial requirements by the time her results come out we will be in the position to pay the required funds. On the same note if our daughter fails to come out with satisfaction results we need to be able to weigh other options before we pay some remarkable amount of money.

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, I had a really tight schedule today at work. Coming to your concern I can see you have shared 3 concerns in one, the financial concerns will be addressed be assured, however, you mentioned ""Local Procedure"" could you please, help me understand this statement of yours better so that I can have a better understanding?
244 - 05 Dec 2023 10:17PM - +263 77 234 5931: Here  you can only be accepted in the university with A level results upfront
245 - 05 Dec 2023 10:33PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are saying, however, please understand that with the Endowment benefits we discussed earlier, it is an added benefit for you to reserve Blessing's seat before A-level. Being in the education sector for more than 14+ years Edoofa has been able to know what the right solution for a student, for international students the scholarship seats get limited, and by the time the results are out parents and students are all worried they would get the scholarship in there a desired college or not, or if the scholarship offered is upto their expectations or not.
246 - 05 Dec 2023 10:33PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is why if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.  May I know if you are clear?

So my question is, is this also for those who have already majored something else and have a diploma cause for me I am currently studying business management and I wanted to upgrade by studying business administration, so I am I going to start all over again or it will be a continuation?
243 - 05 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bridget.  I hope you are doing well. Let me help you understand. Bridget, to pursue a bachelor's degree, students need to have completed their MSCE exams or hold a three-year-long diploma. However, based on the records we have for you, it appears that the diploma you are currently pursuing is a two-year program, and unfortunately, it is not recognized at a global level for bachelor's degree entry requirements.
244 - 05 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering that you have already completed your MSCE exams earlier, and the results you have for them are sufficient for you to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, the same has been utilized for your admission into the university for the same course.

463 - 05 Dec 2023 07:16PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let me help you understand why continuing Aisha's process for next year's intake is not a good idea. Because you will be losing on the Endowment benefits, meaning you will not be granted the $150 grant and the other 6 benefits we discussed above. That is the reason we were not suggesting the same to you. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out.

465 - 05 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: The reason being, that the universities revise the tuition fee every year, and by the time you start with Aisha's admission in 2025, that would further add to the financial pressure since the fee would be increased by at least 40%. As of now, the scholarship offer that Aisha has received is in accordance with 2023's fee structure, and as we move forward with the rounds of application, the fee for 2024 will be revised, adding to the financial burden for you and your family.  Secondly, when you factor in the economy of Zimbabwe I am sure you are aware that over the past few years, the economy has been in decline. By the next year, while you might be able to save up on expenses, these costs might factor in and once again add to your financial burden.
466 - 05 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, while we understand that you are the ones who are to make decisions for your child's higher education, we, as educators, have guided thousands of students every year to help them plan their admission process and higher education despite the financial challenges they face. Just like those students, ma'am, if you want us to help you out here, which is something we wish to do, I believe you have to take a step forward, understand the recommendations we have in place, and the basis of the same. If you are willing to work towards the solution, then we can certainly help you out.

Secondly, when you factor in the economy of Zimbabwe I am sure you are aware that over the past few years, the economy has been in decline. By the next year, while you might be able to save up on expenses, these costs might factor in and once again add to your financial burden.
466 - 05 Dec 2023 07:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, while we understand that you are the ones who are to make decisions for your child's higher education, we, as educators, have guided thousands of students every year to help them plan their admission process and higher education despite the financial challenges they face. Just like those students, ma'am, if you want us to help you out here, which is something we wish to do, I believe you have to take a step forward, understand the recommendations we have in place, and the basis of the same. If you are willing to work towards the solution, then we can certainly help you out.

350 - 05 Dec 2023 01:53PM - +260 97 7632700: So if a student gets  10 to 16 points will they still be awarded a schoolarship
351 - 05 Dec 2023 01:54PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades/ 45% passing marks to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) or 45% passing marks in grdae 12 in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
352 - 05 Dec 2023 02:01PM - +260 97 7632700: Sorry hell me to understand in the line of distinction to credit, here in our country university entry is 5 credit that is the least one can get to be accepted I any university in Zambia, use this explain for me to understand not the percentage way please

354 - 05 Dec 2023 07:46PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in response, I was occupied with some work meetings, so let me help you understand. A point 5 credit or a grade P meaning the student has passed every subject right?
355 - 05 Dec 2023 07:48PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, if a student passes with the minimum passing grade which is a point 3 credit or a CP grade, it will be difficult for the student to qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
356 - 05 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now when I say that Joyce will need two CP grades at least, I mean she would need two CP grades in any of her two subjects and if she achieves a favourable result the university will re-evaluate their application.

Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.  This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. I hope you are clear with this?
27 - 05 Dec 2023 10:12AM - +260 96 7808874: Good morning Kirti  Kindly note that patience just completed her grade 12 exams whose results will only be out in January or February 2024.  For number 2 and 3 I think I did send her grade 9 results into grade 10 and latest results in term one of grade 12 2023 in our last contact before we postponed to resume in September. For  identity proof I did send her under five card as she is still under age to obtain the national ID until after 11.02.2024 when she will reach the required age to obtain it.  The letter of recommendation we have asked her school administration to send it to us. We will be able to share  here as soon as we receive it and also resend her grade 9 results and Under five card for identity proof.  Thank you. <This message was edited>

60 - 05 Dec 2023 06:35PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
61 - 05 Dec 2023 06:44PM - +260 97 4960102: That is very wonderful to hear.
62 - 05 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
78 - 05 Dec 2023 07:17PM - +260 97 4960102: Noted thank you
79 - 05 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
80 - 05 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
81 - 05 Dec 2023 07:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
82 - 05 Dec 2023 07:20PM - +260 97 4960102: I am following
83 - 05 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
84 - 05 Dec 2023 07:53PM - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have
85 - 05 Dec 2023 07:55PM - +260 97 4960102: May please provide with more information
86 - 05 Dec 2023 07:57PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ garde 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
87 - 05 Dec 2023 07:58PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two CP grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their Grade 12.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.",No,No

I wasn't able to connect with you when you reached out to me as it was past my available hours. Hence, may I know if you are currently available to move on with our session?

182 - 05 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
183 - 05 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

216 - 05 Dec 2023 05:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: cNow that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
217 - 05 Dec 2023 05:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?

221 - 05 Dec 2023 06:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
222 - 05 Dec 2023 06:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.

I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos.  *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
116 - 05 Dec 2023 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
117 - 05 Dec 2023 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
118 - 05 Dec 2023 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
119 - 05 Dec 2023 07:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

138 - 05 Dec 2023 03:44PM - +263 71 602 4985: Yes i am ready
139 - 05 Dec 2023 04:37PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your concern, yes, it is mandatory for the students to follow this plan. The reason why it is done so is that we are ensuring the student secures their seat at the university when the time arrives for the registration fees, hence it would be a relief to the parents in terms of financial burden. May I know if you are clear here?
140 - 05 Dec 2023 05:00PM - +263 71 602 4985: Yeah everything is clear.
141 - 05 Dec 2023 05:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right? <This message was edited>

143 - 05 Dec 2023 05:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.

This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.

175 - 05 Dec 2023 08:25PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
176 - 05 Dec 2023 08:32PM - +263 78 583 4033: Yes l am aware of that so l will choose the one l would like
177 - 05 Dec 2023 08:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
178 - 05 Dec 2023 08:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
179 - 05 Dec 2023 08:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

100 - 05 Dec 2023 08:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.

198 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
199 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
200 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
193 - 04 Dec 2023 08:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

202 - 05 Dec 2023 08:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to 1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
197 - 05 Dec 2023 07:06PM - +265 999 49 36 36: We are all ready to listen to what you have for us this evening
198 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
199 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
200 - 05 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
201 - 05 Dec 2023 07:42PM - +265 997 78 54 07: This was indeed discussed with the counselor it's not strange to us
202 - 05 Dec 2023 08:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to 1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
203 - 05 Dec 2023 08:38PM - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes , please proceed
204 - 05 Dec 2023 08:51PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:   Tuition Fee: $350 per annum Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) Miscellaneous Fee: $1000 Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum <This message was edited>
205 - 05 Dec 2023 08:54PM - +265 999 49 36 36: Can you please come again on your summary
206 - 05 Dec 2023 09:06PM - +265 999 49 36 36: You  said there's:  tuition                 350  Registration.      1000 Miscellaneous.  1000. But the total fee to be paid is $1350, right? If I got you correct",No,Yes

1 hr 3 mins","138 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
139 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.

Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.

Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

91 - 05 Dec 2023 05:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
97 - 05 Dec 2023 06:15PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

360 - 04 Dec 2023 03:29PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand here. Change of diet can be indeed find challenging and hence the university will provide you the option to cook your own food inside the accomodation. In addition to this you will be living with your local community inside the campus where you can share the same cuisines and dishes. This has done by you seniors as well for the past couple of years and they are happy with it.

362 - 04 Dec 2023 05:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand you commitment here, Panashe. What you are thinking is indeed a noble gesture. However I would also like you think the longer picture here with me. With EWYL you will be helping you tuition fees by reducing them and hence helping your parents at the same time by reducing their financial problems. At the same time you will be proceeding with your higher education and this means your future is waiting for opportunities unlike other students in Zimbabwe you will be on the upper hand as you will be equipped with better quality education, better insights extra skill sets and a lots more.

This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023* which you have missed and it is alright I can have a conversation with the university officials for the same by extending it to the 12th of December, 2023.

Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
370 - 05 Dec 2023 08:00PM - +263 71 390 2193: Why is it there is a flexible payment plan for $150 yet there is no flexible payment plan for the required $1000?

372 - 05 Dec 2023 08:15PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 12th, 2023*  2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *January 12th 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>",No,No

134 - 05 Dec 2023 04:38PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. <This message was edited>
135 - 05 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

137 - 05 Dec 2023 08:51PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.  Have you understood?

Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now.

240 - 05 Dec 2023 06:54PM - +263 78 867 1027: Good evening Mr Shivjeet, we are good thanks and how are you doing over there?
241 - 05 Dec 2023 06:55PM - +263 78 867 1027: I'm ready we can proceed with the session please
242 - 05 Dec 2023 06:56PM - +263 77 170 2406: How are you please, we are good thanks
243 - 05 Dec 2023 07:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
244 - 05 Dec 2023 07:30PM - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please
245 - 05 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
246 - 05 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
247 - 05 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*

250 - 05 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
251 - 05 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.",No,No

123 - 05 Dec 2023 04:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'd like to ask if you have any concerns you'd like to share regarding our past conversation.
124 - 05 Dec 2023 05:27PM - +263 77 238 8186: Yes we were concerned about the payment plan you proposed that is for 10 months, we want to guarantee you that we will be able to pay what ever the money you would want when the time comes, we have started a project towards this program so we will have enough to fund for any stage
125 - 05 Dec 2023 06:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds like a great approach, and I appreciate your commitment to securing the funds for the payment plan. It's great to know that you've initiated a project geared toward funding this program. This stance demonstrates your dedication and determination to fulfill the financial obligations associated with the program.
126 - 05 Dec 2023 06:15PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, with regards to this, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right?
127 - 05 Dec 2023 06:47PM - +263 77 238 8186: Yaa, true
128 - 05 Dec 2023 07:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well.

130 - 05 Dec 2023 07:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.  Have you understood?
131 - 05 Dec 2023 08:10PM - +263 77 238 8186: Understand, it's fine we will do that, we will advise you our plan on that 900,since we are going to Open an account we can deposit monthly in the bank
