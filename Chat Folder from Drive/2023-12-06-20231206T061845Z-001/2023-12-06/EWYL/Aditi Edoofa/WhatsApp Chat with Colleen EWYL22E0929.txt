21/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 465 9361: Yes sir
21/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 976 6473: Ma'am
21/08/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
21/08/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
21/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 465 9361: I understand sir
21/08/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Colleen I would like to mention that I am a female so I would appreciate it if you would address me as Ms. Aditi or ma'am.
21/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 465 9361: Okay ma'am
21/08/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
21/08/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 465 9361: Yes ma'am
21/08/23, 4:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.

08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Thursday!
I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Looking forward to see those🤩
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

28/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 83602 51384: I understand ma'am
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We're concluding this session now, and we'll pick up right where we left off. Let's reconvene for our chat session tomorrow at *5 PM.* 🚀
28/11/23, 4:34 pm - +91 83602 51384: noted maam
29/11/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good evening!
Hope you are well,

Let's begin with today's session🚀
29/11/23, 1:35 pm - +91 83602 51384: Good evening ma'am
29/11/23, 1:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
29/11/23, 1:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

Criteria	September + October
Webinar	       1/6
Attendance	2/6
Orientation	Absent
Fee status	Clear
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - +91 83602 51384: Noted ma'am
29/11/23, 1:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
29/11/23, 1:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - +91 83602 51384: Yes ma'am
29/11/23, 1:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.

My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
29/11/23, 1:48 pm - +91 83602 51384: I understand ma'am I will try to work and pull up my attendances in all sessions
29/11/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
That would be appreciated.
29/11/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
29/11/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:53 pm - +91 83602 51384: I understand the plan ma'am
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it. <This message was edited>

29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.

Also I would like to continue to take your training session for the $300 training paln, to ensure you are all ready to earn credits.
29/11/23, 2:13 pm - +91 83602 51384: Yes ma'am
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As your mentor, I have always strived to ensure you get enough opportunities to self-finance your education. I have worked hard every step of the way with you to enhance your performance and skills to do well in your project opportunities. In other attempts to meet our objectives, I have always tried to have a rewarding system that helps all our Edoofians earn considerable credits that help reduce the burden of their sponsors and parents back in their home country.
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @918360251384 May I know if you are there?

Grateful for your presence in India, the goal is to extend that gratitude by sharing the conveniences of your new life, such as uninterrupted electricity and nearly free internet, with your loved ones. This project aims to hone your storytelling skills, fostering confidence, creativity, empathy, and perspective, while also enhancing presentation abilities. As part of the training, you'll guide others on sharing their stories and be empowered to select community members based on readiness.
