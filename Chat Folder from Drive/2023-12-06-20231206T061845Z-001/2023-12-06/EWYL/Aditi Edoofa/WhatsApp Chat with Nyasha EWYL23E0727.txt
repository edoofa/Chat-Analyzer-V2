08/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ,,so the EWYL programme is going to help raise awareness  of the skills needed by employers right and it is going to teach us those skills and how to utilise them ,some of these skills are social media literacy,creative writing and data analysis to name a few  . We will be focusing on 2 projects  the first one is  corporate alliances right where we will be looking for and interacting with local organisations right and arranging a meeting  between Edoofa and the organisation and also insuring the signing of a contract between the two, so we will he doing one activity at a time ,the first one which is identifying the companies ,the second one is approaching them and telling them about Edoofa, scheduling a meeting and then signing  the contract. The second project is  community building ryt ,here we will be  working with other students right ,telling them about Edoofa, and encouraging and persuading them to join and be a part of Edoofa  and also working with schools  and enlightening them about Edoofa
08/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
08/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 393 2102: Thank you ma'am
08/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
08/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ma'am, that's fine
08/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 393 2102: I am done ma'am
08/11/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
08/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay uhm ,I have learned that the main objective of corporate alliance is to be able to identify market opportunities . I will also have to identify   with technologically driven and digital companies and explaining to them about the purpose of Edoofa and how it will help me after graduation, I can also download a Linked in and create an account which will help me identify managers or directors of these companies and gather their information which will help in setting up a meeting with Edoofa
08/11/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
08/11/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
08/11/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay
08/11/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay well it is basically a guide right on the companies to look for ,where to look for them ,how to identify them and also how to connect with them  ryt . So the companies should have between 50 to 200 employees ryt and the company should either be student-centric or recreational ryt .The background  of the founder should also be taken into consideration .Financial stability should also be taken into consideration . Different social media platforms can be used ,for instance google ,linked in facebook to name a few
08/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb, Nyasha!
08/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

*Company Details for Project 1*

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
08/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

08/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ,that sounds interesting
08/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
We can do that via platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly Linked In.
I will need you to create your accounts on all these platforms and share your usernames with me in our session in the format mentioned below:
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
Linked In Id Link:

Now, When you have created the accounts on all these platforms, You can use the search features provided on all these platforms to look for companies that suit our criteria.
08/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ma'am, I will do so
08/11/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
08/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can send these later after the session as well.
08/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Nyasha, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
08/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to express how delightful our conversation has been. I eagerly look forward to our next one.
08/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ,the second project is community building right  , students can develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to use social media to help other african students and give them an opportunity  to join Edoofa and acquire education that helps prepare them  for the future as well. Students are required to reach out to students who have recently graduated high school or are in their last year if high school and refer these students to join Edoofa.  This helps students earn scholarship credits as well
08/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 393 2102: Thank you ma'am,,have a good  day
08/11/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: We will connect on this in our next session.

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
09/11/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
09/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay I understand
09/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*NYASHA/ADITI/9NOV23*
09/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
09/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
09/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
09/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay okay I understand

09/11/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ,,so I have to approach them first ,then I add them to the group right
09/11/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you can do it either way.
09/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
09/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

09/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
09/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
09/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
09/11/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: As we come to the end of today's sessions, I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*. You must learn about Diwali, *light a candle on the occasion*, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩

15/11/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
15/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ma'am, I understand

16/11/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!

16/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 393 2102: Network is still slow this side ma'am so some messages may take a while to deliver
16/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's okay!

Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
16/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 393 2102: My Instagram is refusing to connect probably because of poor network but I will keep trying and send it to you

16/11/23, 11:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand!
Thanks for letting me know.
16/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
16/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/11/23, 11:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 393 2102: Okay ma'am, I understand
16/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 393 2102: Let me do that now
16/11/23, 12:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I apologize for the delayed response as I was at lunch.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

25/11/23, 12:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello! No need to apologize; family events like your sister's graduation are important, and I completely understand. I hope you had a great time celebrating with your sister. It's understandable that you couldn't anticipate the network disruptions due to the president's presence.
