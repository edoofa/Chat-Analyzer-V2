You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
05/08/23, 10:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that you have been quite occupied with your preparations. However, I would still appreciate it if you stay connected on your EWYL Line. This will allow me to share lessons and activities with you, and whenever you can find some time, you can share your responses. This way, your attendance can be maintained.

So, kindly follow your EWYL ritual so that I can share your activities with you!

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟

I must say it's quite disheartening that you couldn't find even 15 minutes for someone who has been working tirelessly for your benefit. I've been trying to get in touch with you for over a week now.

The call I wanted to have with you is solely for your own advantage. It presents an amazing opportunity that I believe you should be a part of. However, if you have no interest in seizing this opportunity, please do let me know.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share a update regarding your son, Caleb.

Over the past month, our team has extended every possible assistance to ensure Caleb's smooth transition to India. We have diligently supported him with documentation, obtaining a SIM card, and arranging accommodation. Despite these efforts and constant reminders, it is with deep regret that I inform you that Caleb has not attended a single session, even after being personally urged to do so by Mr. Harshit from our team.

This lack of engagement is not only concerning but also a matter of great disappointment for me as mentor. I believe in the importance of a strong work ethic and dedication to one's educational pursuits, and it is concerning to see Caleb's lack of commitment in this regard.
16/10/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: I kindly request your support and intervention to emphasize the significance of his education and the opportunities provided to him. I sincerely hope that Caleb will soon recognize the importance of his academic responsibilities and make the necessary changes to ensure his success during his time in India.
16/10/23, 10:36 am - +267 73 209 074: Good morning dear we  apologise dear we will talk to Caleb about the issue
16/10/23, 11:04 am - +267 73 542 159: Apologies Ms Ananya im still trying to catch up to the school work and blend in, i will try my best to improve next time
20/10/23, 10:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder_*

I hope you remember that, as per our schedule, we have a call tomorrow! I can't wait to connect with you because I have some amazing concepts to share and discuss! 🚀

25/10/23, 7:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

We're back with our EWYL group session today at *6:00 PM*, and I couldn't be more thrilled! 🚀

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. Let's make this session unforgettable!
09/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

02/12/23, 6:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Caleb!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:30 PM*

I hope to see you there!🚀
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Caleb! 🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting tomorrow, we will only connect on Wednesdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.

📅 Wednesday, 6th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 13th December:
*Group Call*

📅 Wednesday, 19th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 29th December:
*Group Call*
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I am ready to take a step ahead by considering and respecting your time and schedule. I expect you to reciprocate the same and attend the calls. Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰
