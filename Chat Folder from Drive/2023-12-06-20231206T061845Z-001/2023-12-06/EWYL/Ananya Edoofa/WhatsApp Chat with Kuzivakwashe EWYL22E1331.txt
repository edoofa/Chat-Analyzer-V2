02/12/23, 6:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kuzivakwashe!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:30 PM*

I hope to see you there!🚀
02/12/23, 5:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the call!
02/12/23, 8:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you know I rearranged my whole day just to ensure that you could attend your call and not miss out on any opportunities. However, even after extending my working hours, it is quite disappointing and disheartening that you did not attend the call. Can I know the reason behind this?
05/12/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Urgent : New schedule_*🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting tomorrow, we will only connect on Wednesdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.

📅 Wednesday, 6th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 13th December:
*Group Call*

📅 Wednesday, 19th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 29th December:
*Group Call*
05/12/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I am ready to take a step ahead by considering and respecting your time and schedule. I expect you to reciprocate the same and attend the calls. Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰
