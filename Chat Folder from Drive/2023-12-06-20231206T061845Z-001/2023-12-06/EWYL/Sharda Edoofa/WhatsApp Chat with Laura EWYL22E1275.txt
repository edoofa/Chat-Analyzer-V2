I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

29/09/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 631 3577: Greetings once again @917827308969 so I really enjoyed the webinar I wish I would have known earlier how interesting they were so this last September webinar was based on Communication skills:Mastering the Art of Storytelling they were about 9 questions.Communication as told by Mr Tavershima is more about being concerned about a desired result and we all know that communication is a conversation between 2 or more people but according him it is when a sender is sending a message and expecting feedback so he also gave examples of Macron the President of France and also the former president of the United States of America Obama he said they had to learn like what we were doing so that they could be massive communicators.He elaborated out a number of things but i’m just mentioning a few that seemed interesting to me and that I mostly paid attention to. Question 5 which went to say Why storytelling.Storytelling is done so as to educate the young ones even the peers can listen to stories.By doing storytelling it is way more easier to pass on the word to the next person for it is easier to retell through the morals that come out so according to Mr Tavershima,he gave an example of the little red riding hood which gives out a moral value that we should listen to what our parents would have told us.

25/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
