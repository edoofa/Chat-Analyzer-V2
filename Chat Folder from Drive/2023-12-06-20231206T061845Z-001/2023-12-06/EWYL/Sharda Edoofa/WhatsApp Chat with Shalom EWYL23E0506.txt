Before connecting with you today, I  reviewed your applications and gathered feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted.

I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

10/08/23, 7:54 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
 Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
10/08/23, 7:56 am - +263 77 901 1028: Morning ma'am I have no problem with time
10/08/23, 7:57 am - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
10/08/23, 7:58 am - +263 77 901 1028: Noted with thanks
10/08/23, 7:59 am - +91 78273 08969: We will have our session at our schedule time today.
10/08/23, 8:00 am - +263 77 901 1028: Oky
10/08/23, 1:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Shalom?
10/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Wow this is really exciting can't wait to start this journey
10/08/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
10/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 901 1028: It is indeed
10/08/23, 2:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
10/08/23, 2:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky maam
10/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Very inspiring and challenging that starting from the little things can make one to achieve great heights as long one is eager to learn and use the opportunity given
10/08/23, 2:24 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
10/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 901 1028: I side with you that every section has its own uniqueness but I would like to grasp on the quotes used first as I begin.Which according to my point of view they are an eye opener as one can not say he/she is better than the other because he/she possess something but doesn't use it for more other advantages.Only a person can say they are better if they only use the opportunities they have been given to their advantage.Also I have learnt that helping other people does not necessarily mean that you are their subject
10/08/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Yes it's truly an honour
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Yes am ready
10/08/23, 2:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
10/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 901 1028: 1.To begin with my mentor Ms Tenzin,Ms Deepali the Head of the Department,Ms Davi the head coach,my parents who are my sponsors and lastly not to forget myself the student.
2.My mentor wants to make sure that my academic journey is great
-to ensure that am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India
-That I be able to work towards attaining the objective that am learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills to prepare myself for the real world workplace and that I grow holistically
3.Mr Angad Singh .founder of Edoofa,interact with all students through Newsletter
4.From my point of view the Hall of Inspiration is a testimony from other students on how they have achieved in their EWYL projects through the help of their mentors.
10/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your answers showcase a strong grasp of the concepts we have been discussing. Your ability to articulate your thoughts and ideas clearly and concisely is truly impressive. Keep up the excellent work.
10/08/23, 3:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Have a great day.
10/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you so much ma'am
10/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you same to you
11/08/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Afternoon ma'am
11/08/23, 1:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
11/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Am good thank you for asking and how are you
11/08/23, 1:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am good, Thank you.
11/08/23, 1:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
11/08/23, 1:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Yes ma'am
11/08/23, 1:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you are done?
11/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Am done
11/08/23, 2:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please share your understanding of the same.
11/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky..To begin with, I understood that there are four projects which have their own activities bt I also noted that in all these activities skills are the major key in achieving your goals.As you get to interact with people you have to know how you build a relationship with them , identifying an opportunity and be enthusiastic about it,in the interaction with influencers or companies you get to give them the ideas that will help develop their business and also be a risk taker no matter how much you get disappointed as a student you never give up.Not to forget that sharing knowledge about Edoofa to those who are still at High school or who have completed in a matter of 6 months gets one scholarship credits
11/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: Shalom There are three projects.
We will study them in detail.
11/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky ma'am
11/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Am done maam
11/08/23, 3:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please share your understanding.
11/08/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Corportelalliance this project seeks to make a student understand the type of market they want to enter and help to start it at an early stage.Furthermore this starts with the people that are close to you who will help you to to identify the companies in my country through digital use and share on how Edoofa is helping you to develop such skills.Also it is advised for one to create an LinkedIn account that allows to search for companies and managers ,and once one has acquired this app it will be easy to set up meetings with Edoofa.This expands chances professional network and increases a chance of securing internships and gaining industrial exposure or finding job opportunities in my country
11/08/23, 3:49 pm - +91 78273 08969: Amazing, thanks Shalom. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
11/08/23, 3:50 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you ma'am.On it now
11/08/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 901 1028: It highlights that one should look for potential companies that collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of the students that enrol for Edoofa.There are things that one has to consider when looking for companies that is the nature of the company.They should have a career development platforms and tech or have a virtual gaming platforms/podcasts,music just to mention a few .One should be able to scale the company and it should always rank at a medium ranges one has to keep into consideration the size of employees in the company.Financial stability should be sound that is to check the updates of sources such as crunchbase
Background of the found is a major key as a founder has to have good experience and qualifications.Not to forget that there are platforms to be used to research such information on the founder like Google along with social media ,it is advised that when searching the use of key words must be used to get profound results such as" *young*  *entrepreneurs*in *Zimbabwe*" also with the information given it is important to choose wisely the company you have found by taking note of are there any updates for vacancies ,the background of the company considering the year of establishment,the people and information about employees . Lastly study the website of the company if it's functioning or not , careful study gives the brief information about the founder and core members of the company and the various social media platforms they use.
11/08/23, 4:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know what Shalom, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
11/08/23, 4:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Have a great day.
11/08/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you so much ma'am ..a great day to you too

16/08/23, 1:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Shalom!
16/08/23, 1:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 901 1028: I understand that community building is the process of establishing and strengthening connection relationships and shared identities among individuals working in a group  or communities.This helps an individual to gain a sense of belonging and be able to communicate and collaborate and work towards the common goals.The main objective of this project is to forster a positive and a cohesive community that promotes social interactions and participation in a shared senses of responsibility towards achieving collective success.The primary outcome that is being targeted is for the student to develop networking and convincing skills that is being able to use social media to reach other African students to join Edoofa education ecosystem and acquire international education that will prepare them for the future.By reaching out students get to identify motivated youths who are willing to create great careers and direct them to this opportunity.This project seeks students to identify opportunity and share them to make a change in their lives.The students to be reached out should have completed their high school or are in the process of completing it they can be personal and be extended networks.Students have to use their skills to refer the students to the program to help the organisation to grow and not to forget that Edoofa will be there to offer their guidance.By being successful in this project the students will be rewarded scholarship credit.
In conclusion one can notice that through this project the students gets to market the Edoofa education to the ones who don't know about it and that will also help the referring student to get scholarship credits.

16/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Well understood
16/08/23, 2:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all. for today, Let us continue tomorrow.

16/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you ma'am same for you
17/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Greetings maam
17/08/23, 1:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
17/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Am oky and how are you
17/08/23, 1:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am good, Thank you.
17/08/23, 1:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
17/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky maam
17/08/23, 1:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
17/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky
17/08/23, 1:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
17/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Well understood
17/08/23, 1:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
17/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky ma'am
17/08/23, 1:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 901 1028: It is clear
17/08/23, 1:48 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
17/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky
17/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Should I be doing this now?
17/08/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, You can start this project.
17/08/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
17/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Yes ma'am
17/08/23, 2:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Have a nice day.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program.

22/08/23, 2:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/08/23, 2:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa EWYL.vcf (file attached)
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Oky so I should contact this number
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: yes, Shalom. Your session will take place on this line.

22/08/23, 2:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Understood
22/08/23, 2:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
22/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Well explained and understood
22/08/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
22/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 901 1028: Thank you ma'am . Tomorrow I won't be available due to the elections

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

10/10/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

11/10/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform.

11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Since you are aware that we have our call scheduled on this saturday, please make sure you complete this task by 12:00pm on Friday.*
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

Have you come across any obstacles that might need my assistance? I'm interested in gaining insight into the current status of the project from your point of view.

11/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 86990 84189: Since I haven't found any people so it's a bit challenging
11/10/23, 4:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I will connect with you over a call on Google meet and I will share the details of the same with you.
11/10/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, we will discuss few strategies to connect with students in our next sessin.
11/10/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session.

Our first step is to connect with potential applicants. Please share your thoughts on how we can best reach out to deserving candidates. Let's brainstorm together.

Once we've identified potential candidates, This will be crucial in helping candidates understand what Edoofa is all about.
08/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 86990 84189: At first it states that you have to give a testimony about how you managed to pass your high education and be able to find the scholarship not to forget that it takes a long time but Edoofa makes it easy for you
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 86990 84189: Then number 2 ...you have to state why Edoofa out of all the scholarships ..

Please add any additional questions you think might help in assessing the candidates' understanding.
\
08/11/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 4: Evaluation and Sharing* 
After collecting the answers, you'll evaluate them. Only those who show a clear understanding of the program will be eligible to receive the Edoofa Application form. If any candidate needs further clarification or has misconceptions, please guide them and share the right information.
Your role is crucial in ensuring that we're reaching out to the most deserving and informed applicants. Let's work together to make this process smooth and successful.
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 86990 84189: Yes here you mention that edoofa is the only scholarship that helps students to be employable or be able to pay their own fees through Earn while you learn
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes that is correct.
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm sure you have already created the questions for the verification process. Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 86990 84189: Noted maam

08/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.

24/11/23, 4:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please. Why have you not joined the Webinar yet?
25/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Shalom, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.
