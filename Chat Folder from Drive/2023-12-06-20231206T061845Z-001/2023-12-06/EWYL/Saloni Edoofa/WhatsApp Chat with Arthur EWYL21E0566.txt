10/08/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 931 0305: The Founder Mr Angad Singh is encouraging us the edoofian students to be hard workers and the future is in our hand.The teacher opens the door but we must enter our selfs which means l must work hard in order for me to enter through the door if l don’t work hard l will remain on the door steps.When we are setting our goals if they are big goals we need to break them into smaller goals because if we try to archive big goals it will be difficult and we will be demotivated leading to failure. Small steps help us develop good habits and builds a strong foundation for success.
I also liked the Hall Inspiration words from Praise who was aging us to think out side our comfort zone and do wonders . She said you can archive anything as long as you set a goal for it and make it be your target to complete it.It only needs us to put effort for our goals to be successful.
10/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Good afternoon

17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I can understand that.
17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have said it correctly, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay well understood
18/08/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

23/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 931 0305: That’s great

Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸
