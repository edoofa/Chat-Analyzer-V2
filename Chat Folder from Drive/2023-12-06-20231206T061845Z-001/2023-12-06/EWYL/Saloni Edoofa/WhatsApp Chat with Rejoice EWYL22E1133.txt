I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you very much sir_*

22/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you very much.We are waiting for the inspiring video._*

The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 797 7023: May you please elaborate on the *two key objectives* l have gone through the video thrice ,I really got inspired.

22/09/23, 1:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, thank you so much.
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Rejoice is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Thank you for explanation; everything is now cristal clear.I took note of the two key objectives._*
22/09/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great⚡
22/09/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much
22/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 797 7023: I have known the EWLY team.Thank you very much.
22/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
26/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Greetings
26/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Noted with thanks
26/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Rejoice will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
26/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much.We are going through the document
26/09/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Rejoice can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 797 7023: Thank you very much.
26/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 481 5479: Thank you very much
26/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 797 7023: We have gone through the document
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, great!
26/09/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
26/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 797 7023: *_Currently Rejoice Machekano is at a boarding school Will be writing her A' level final examinations.She will complete her examination on 30th of November 2023._*

I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.

24/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 222 0925: I learnt that when choosing a company to work with l should take into consideration some factors for example the size of business that the business should not be too big or too small
24/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Rejoice, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
24/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

24/11/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
24/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 222 0925: Ok so now I will start working on project 1 and l will be giving you the necessary feedback when I make progress l have now understood thank you
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Rejoice, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Rejoice!
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

24/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 222 0925: I have understood that in order to get scholarship credits l have to influence some students to actively participate in the edoofa program and that is how I get the credits
24/11/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Rejoice, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
24/11/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
24/11/23, 11:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 10:00 - 11:00 AM 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.

This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *10:00 - 11:00* AM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
27/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 222 0925: Good morning Ms Saloni
27/11/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood till here?
27/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 222 0925: Yes l have understood
27/11/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 222 0925: Thank you l have understood
27/11/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Rejoice/Saloni/27NOV2023*
27/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 222 0925: I have understood so l will create the group and also add your number
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, Rejoice!
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
27/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 222 0925: I have understood the forms thank you let me just create the group now

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
27/11/23, 10:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 222 0925: I have learnt that I have to set up a meeting with the headmasters of the schools in my area and the director of EDOOFA
27/11/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

29/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
29/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 222 0925: Ok l will send the school head number

With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
29/11/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

01/12/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/12/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
