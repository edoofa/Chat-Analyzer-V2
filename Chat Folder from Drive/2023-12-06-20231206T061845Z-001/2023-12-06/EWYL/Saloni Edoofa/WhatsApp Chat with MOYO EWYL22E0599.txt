How are you?

It has been 3 days since you followed the daily ritual. May I know if you are facing any challenges?

Not attending the sessions will effect your overall growth and development and I am really worried about the same.
21/08/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Moyo,
I hope you're doing well. 

It's been two days since you last followed your daily ritual. I'm concerned and wanted to check in to see if you're facing any challenges that might be hindering your progress.

I want to emphasize that not attending these sessions can have a significant impact on your overall growth and development. I genuinely care about your well-being and want to ensure you're on the right path to success. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to support you in maintaining your daily routine. Your dedication to this ritual is crucial for your personal and professional development.

How are you?
Would you want that we put your EWYL Program on hold till that time?
22/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 497 1593: I am good ma'am

No ma'am I will try to share my attention equally

I hope this message finds you well. As we embark on our journey of learning and personal growth, I'd like to highlight the significance of time management, a crucial life skill that can greatly influence your academic and personal success.

In today's Wednesday lesson, we will be delving into the art of time management. This topic is not only relevant for your studies but will also prove invaluable in your daily life. Effective time management can help you accomplish tasks efficiently, reduce stress, and make the most of your time.

This lesson is not just about theory; it's about practical application. I encourage you to come prepared with questions and examples from your own experiences. By sharing and discussing your challenges and successes, we can all learn from one another.

Remember, effective time management is a skill that can be developed and refined over time, and it can have a profound impact on your academic journey and future endeavors.

23/08/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you are in school Moyo, I would keep your EWYL Program on hold.
23/08/23, 2:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
23/08/23, 2:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)

18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.
