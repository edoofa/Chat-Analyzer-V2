You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

25/08/23, 12:32 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Yes ma'am
25/08/23, 12:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
25/08/23, 12:34 pm - +91 6239 359 964: That is great ma'am
25/08/23, 12:34 pm - +91 6239 359 964: And true
25/08/23, 12:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
25/08/23, 12:35 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Not really ma'am
25/08/23, 12:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
25/08/23, 12:37 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Alright ma'am, thank you
25/08/23, 12:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
25/08/23, 12:37 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Yes ma'am I will aim higher
25/08/23, 12:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

The good news is that Ms. Saloni your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Saloni's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes. <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Princess, coming to all our recent developments, guess what? While I was scrolling through LinkedIn yesterday, I stumbled upon one of our rockstar students proudly flaunting his recent certification, and the response was mind-blowing! 🌟
30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let's talk about you – have you ever crossed paths with the superhero of the professional world, LinkedIn?
30/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 6239 359 964: No ma'am I haven't
30/11/23, 3:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Princess you know, having a LinkedIn profile is like having a golden ticket in the professional world. It's your online resume, introducing you to potential employers and collaborators. Firstly, it showcases your experience, skills, and education, acting as a digital snapshot of your career. Secondly, it connects you with a vast network of professionals, opening doors to opportunities you might not discover elsewhere. Thirdly, it's a hub for industry insights and trends, keeping you in the loop. Moreover, it's a platform for recommendations, adding credibility to your profile. Lastly, job opportunities often pop up directly on your feed, making job hunting a breeze. In essence, LinkedIn is your personal brand's best friend, helping you shine in the professional arena. 🌐🌟
30/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Yes ma'am this is true
30/11/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For a stellar LinkedIn profile as a first-year college student, start with a professional photo and a catchy headline that showcases your aspirations. Craft a compelling summary introducing yourself and your goals. Highlight your academic achievements and relevant coursework. Add any part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer experiences to showcase your skills. Connect with classmates, professors, and professionals in your field. Endorsements from peers can add credibility. Lastly, share posts or articles related to your interests to show engagement. Keep it polished, and you're ready to make a strong professional impression! 🌟📚
30/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 6239 359 964: Alright ma'am, that is great
30/11/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Princess, when are your exams beginning?
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 6239 359 964: On the 14 of December ma'am
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, how is your preparations going?
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So concluding the session with some awesome news! As I had a conversation with Mr. Anik the Career Development Officer and Ms. Sanjana, the Head of the department, guess what? We're gearing up for an exciting industrial visit backed by Edoofa! In this opportunity you will be able to grasp live and practical knowledge of so many revolutionary things happening around us.🎉
But one thing that I want to share with you personally, something that really made me think hard is that since there will be a lot of students that we have to choose from for this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, will you be able to fall in that top student's category?

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.
