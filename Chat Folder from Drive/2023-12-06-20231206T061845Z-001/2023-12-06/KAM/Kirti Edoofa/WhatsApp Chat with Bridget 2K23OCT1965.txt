27/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group? if yes could you please share their good names and the numbers they would be using?
27/10/23, 8:24 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes they are here

Stella Passo Mnyayi( +265 991778645)
Potipher Mnyayi (+265 0999557076)
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other,  I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
27/10/23, 8:37 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: My name is Bridget Mnyayi I was born in a family of three children, I am from Malawi where I live in the capital city, Lilongwe. My parents are the one's who have been sponsoring my education ever since and they will also be responsible for the same with this program.
27/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a bit about yourself. It's great to hear that your parents have been supporting your education throughout your life, and they will continue to do so with this program. Your family's support and dedication are valuable assets in your educational journey.
27/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
27/10/23, 8:42 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Very well
27/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
27/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (03rd November ) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
27/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
27/10/23, 8:44 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: That will be done, yes we shall.
27/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
27/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Bridget 2K23OCT1965)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
27/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Bridget EWYL23E0853)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
27/10/23, 8:53 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Very clear
27/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/10/23, 9:03 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: First of all I think everything with this program is great, however I am particularly more impressed with the chances one can have on the percentage of the scholarship for instance I have a chance of 60-100 percentage scholarship in which it means alot to me, not only that but also the Earn While You Learn Program and this is because it will help to reduce the amount of money my parents will have to provide in supporting my studies and also it will help to motivate me as a student to keep on working extra hard towards creating a better learning experience with the Edoofa Scholarship program. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you are impressed with the Edoofa Scholarship program. The flexibility in scholarship percentages, ranging from 60-100%, is indeed a fantastic opportunity that can make a significant difference in managing your educational expenses. It's not only a financial benefit but also a motivating factor, encouraging you to work diligently and excel in your studies.
27/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program is an additional advantage as it not only reduces the financial burden on your parents but also provides you with valuable work experience, contributing to a well-rounded educational experience.
27/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
27/10/23, 9:12 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes you can
27/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now  I will be sharing 3 forms with you, please let me know once you receive the forms one by one.
27/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Feedback Form:* Your candid feedback is invaluable in our pursuit of excellence. This form offers you the chance to voice your opinions and suggestions. Print the form, write your feedback by hand, and affix a passport-sized photo as indicated.

However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.
27/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this form, I have shared all the forms you have to submit to begin your procedures, please let me know once you have taken note of them so that we can move forward.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes I have
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Please note, that it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, if you as a student are not available your parents/ guardians can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on your behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as your participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if you are occupied with exams, your parents on your behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 03rd of November, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
27/10/23, 9:48 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes we are
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the Student application form, it is duly noted with us.
27/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to note that all three of these forms should be completed and submitted by Monday at 02:30 PM. This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Friday, 3rd November enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

27/10/23, 10:00 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Thanks, you too.
30/10/23, 5:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
30/10/23, 5:24 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Understood
30/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
30/10/23, 5:43 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes we are
30/10/23, 5:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:00 PM.
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. MSCE Result/Letter of Recommendation.*

*2. JCE Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
30/10/23, 5:57 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Sorry, but do you mean all the answers should be submitted tomorrow?
30/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can share the documents and fill out the SOP now, you have the whole night to work on the academic interview questions and tomorrow morning as well.
30/10/23, 6:00 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright thanks.
30/10/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, so can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the forms and complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:00 pm?
30/10/23, 6:45 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I filled the whole form but due to network problems everything is gone the moment I was submitting, so please bare with me
30/10/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I shall wait for your response.
30/10/23, 6:48 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Thanks for understanding
30/10/23, 7:22 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us.
31/10/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 5:32 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yeah
31/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
31/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 5:42 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I don't, where is the $750 coming in?
31/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing to error. I have updated that.
31/10/23, 5:44 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright, now I get it
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 5:52 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I understand
31/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 5:57 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: For now no queries
31/10/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 6:04 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I am very excited
31/10/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. We shall share your application once you share the letter with us.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>

31/10/23, 9:48 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Sharda_ and she has scheduled my session for_03/11/2023_*(mention the date)

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!

02/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bridget 

I hope you are doing well. Since it has been some days, I would like to know the update about the JCE letter?
02/11/23, 3:57 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Good afternoon

I had a chance to talk with one of the teachers, unfortunately he no longer works there and that was the only number I hard, so I was thinking of going there tomorrow which means I will give feedback tomorrow afternoon.

02/11/23, 4:17 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright
03/11/23, 12:49 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Hello I went to the school but the head teacher together with the deputy head teacher are not around and the person I was referred to said I should come back again on Monday morning because she don't have the authority to  write a later for me and the stump is also in the heads office and it is locked
03/11/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting today as I was occupied with work meetings and my schedule was really tight today. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for Monday 02:30 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
03/11/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in that case, you can share the letter on Monday please.
03/11/23, 11:34 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Ok
03/11/23, 11:34 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Have a great night
06/11/23, 10:45 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Hello 
can you provide me with the details to include in the later like the Edoofa address and everything because they say they can not write an open ended later
06/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bridget.

I hope you are doing well with regard to our conversation over the personal window, I hope you are clear regarding the concern you had and I shall be waiting for an update from you regarding the JCE letter.
06/11/23, 12:13 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes they have provided me with a later but it's a general one
06/11/23, 12:14 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 12:14 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation, however, I noticed that in this letter there is not where mentioned about your JCE performance?
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I explained to them and this is what they offered me.
06/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that in that case, I would suggest you ask them to issue another letter, please since the university officials would need the details as well that the letter if issued for your JCE performance.
06/11/23, 1:20 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Then I will go back some other time
06/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you will be able to get the letter by tomorrow since it has been a long time, and we will not be able to share your application with the universities and this will delay your application only?
27/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Bridget,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group Of Institutes* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

27/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:43 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Good morning
28/11/23, 9:44 am - +265 998 27 29 75: I will be available, thank you
28/11/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bridget.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you have acknowledged the message, and I am looking forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm today.
28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Bridget,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Good evening
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes I did
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:20 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes it's alright
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 6:28 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
$1000

2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
With air cooler (room of two it's $900 and a room of three it's $750), With air conditioning (a room of two it's $1200 and a room of three it's $1000)

3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
It's $500
28/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1100.
28/11/23, 6:56 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Ooh ok I didn't notice the $100
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please since you are clear now. Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $500 = $1600. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 7:00 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Very well sir
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 7:09 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1600 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 7:12 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: It is very helpful
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $500 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1100 - $500 = $600. 

I hope you are clear about this as well? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I thought it's $500
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error, I have updated the same.
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: It's ok
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $500 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 7:20 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes please
28/11/23, 7:21 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: 15 working days is not enough though
28/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $350 of the registration fee. This $350 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$175 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$175 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $350 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 7:25 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: But I received the offer letter yesterday in which upon reaching 1st December it will only be 5days not 15 days, or help me understand on this one please
28/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry, my keyboard has been acting up, and I have not been able to type the correct date because of that maybe, however, I am trying to fix that. Please note I have updated it.
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright thanks
28/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
28/11/23, 7:41 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I will use the same mode I used with the enrolment fee
28/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/11/23, 7:44 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: If you don't mind would you, please share more information about the college
28/11/23, 7:45 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: And give me assurance that it is one of India's best collage
28/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me share the insights of the university with you.
28/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.

28/11/23, 7:48 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Would share pictures of the hostels, if you have no problem with that please.
28/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: And I also want to know if the facility has a gym and how laundry is done.
28/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand, I believe I have shared a hostel picture with you above, and no please, the gym and laundry are not included in the accommodations if you chose on-campus accommodations, however, if you chose off-campus accommodations, there are multiple accommodations and student when arrives in India, visits the accommodations first then chose accordingly.
28/11/23, 8:18 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright
28/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
28/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
28/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 30th November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
28/11/23, 8:22 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Perfect
28/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night ahead.
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Thanks, you too
30/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bridget!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest Group of Institutions. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of Institutions as a collective?
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 77 86 45: Good afternoon
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too. I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of Institutions as a collective?
30/11/23, 4:02 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Good afternoon, sorry for the late reply I thought today's discussions will happen the same time as the last one
30/11/23, 4:03 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Yes we did
30/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
30/11/23, 4:08 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: I think everything went well
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and that is good to know.

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright, after the discussion my family suggested that I should also hear more information about the university from one of the Edoofans who is from Malawi, so my request is if possible and if you don't mind can I have a contact number of one of the students from quest group of institutions belonging to   the country Malawi, secondly about the off cumpas accommodation how far is it from the collage and it's safety, not only that but also about the university as you said that you only offer best universities and collages to your Edoofians so from India's ranking on what level is quest group of institutions?. <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, let me help your queries one by one Let me address your concern about the student from Malawi studying in India under Quest you can contact Gervais Bizumuremyi his number his +265 993 98 66 79
30/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now getting to your second concern. The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month. I hope you understand?
30/11/23, 6:42 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Thank you
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright thanks
30/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 11, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $175, or you can opt to pay the full $350 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 7:02 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Am sorry but wait abit, talking of how best the university is you didn't tell me about this, cause I remember I was watching about Galgotias university and it states that is the best university in India so I wanted to know about quest.
30/11/23, 7:03 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Will pay using initial payment of $175 then later the other half
30/11/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265998272975 Let me help you understand what you are saying. However, being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for you..
30/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
30/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
30/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
30/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
30/11/23, 7:11 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Very clear
30/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
30/11/23, 7:14 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Am not aware
30/11/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
30/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $500 to Quest to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $500.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $500, but because you would have already paid $500 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $500 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?

05/12/23, 9:18 am - +265 998 27 29 75: Good morning,
I have questions for you, I heard that to get the degree I will have to start in year one. So my question is, is this also for those who have already majored something else and have a diploma cause for me I am currently studying business management and I wanted to upgrade by studying business administration, so I am I going to start all over again or it will be a continuation?
05/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Bridget.

I hope you are doing well. Let me help you understand. Bridget, to pursue a bachelor's degree, students need to have completed their MSCE exams or hold a three-year-long diploma. However, based on the records we have for you, it appears that the diploma you are currently pursuing is a two-year program, and unfortunately, it is not recognized at a global level for bachelor's degree entry requirements.
05/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering that you have already completed your MSCE exams earlier, and the results you have for them are sufficient for you to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, the same has been utilized for your admission into the university for the same course.
05/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 998 27 29 75: Alright, thanks
05/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead!
