I hope this message finds you well, thank you for your concern and for sharing the O-level result it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I am
11/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes yes I think I remember the steps
11/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I recall that on our last discussion I had counselling sessions on university admission and I got a fair picture of a varsity environment
11/10/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
11/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 698 9967: No not at all
11/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 698 9967: We can proceed
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you so much for all the efforts
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Ohhh woow this is interesting
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I am Done reviewing them
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263776989967 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 698 9967: That's amazing
11/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Okay
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: That's interesting
11/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I understand
11/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Ohhh okay
11/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes yes it's quite clear
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 698 9967: This is also direct and clear as well
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Please provide more information on the above
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
11/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I now understand
11/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I guess so
11/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I agree
11/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I understand that
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes it's clear
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Okay that's interesting
11/10/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, pelase. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 698 9967: With regards to benefit 1 let's say a student reappears for the 2024 June exams right,will they still wait for 2025 or they would get admission in the same year?
11/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. Yes, please since the academic intake in India is only in the month of August, with the Endowment program the student will have two options either to reappear for the batch 2025 or what he/she can do is opt for a diploma course and after the diploma course, pursue the bachelor's degree. 

I hope we are clear now?
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes its clear,thank you
11/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, as your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes of course
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Very well ma'am it's noted

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/11/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/11/23, 7:46 am - +263 77 698 9967: Good day @917292063289 I'm happy with the news...
17/11/23, 7:48 am - +263 77 698 9967: I'd like to reschedule   the time for our discussion...01:00 PM to 03:00 PM
17/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 367 2631: I hope I also find you well Kirti.As Promise's mother I am very happy for securing a place at Lovely University.I really appreciate this. I was told its a lovely place just like it's name
17/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

I am glad to hear that you are happy and you are most welcome. That is alright, please may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 367 2631: Yes i am available
17/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 367 2631: It's fine. may you summarize the payments I have to do by 31 December 2023 just for clarity
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we move ahead with our discussion everything will be discussed in detail do not worry and I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 367 2631: 1.semester tuition after scholarship Is us$1225
2.4 years (8 semesters)
3 admission processing fee is $200
4, registration fee is $700
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 367 2631: Yes very clear
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 367 2631: Okay noted
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
17/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 367 2631: Alright madam
17/11/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Promise,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Good day @917292063289 I apologize for the late response I hadn't responded as I was caught up with some activities on my end , however I'd like to carry on with discussion because I am connected
18/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that complete, may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I have a question
According to the PDF you sent there is a portion of it that I am required to fill in ....am I supposed to have a hardcopy of this form or I'll have to do it electronically
18/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes I clearly understood
18/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. Ideally, this form is to be filled by the student but since your application file is handled by the Edoofa scholarship program once you complete your admission formalities and make the deposit of your registration fee this form would be filled in by the Admissions team on your behalf, so it is not for you to be filled by.
18/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Ohhhh it's okay then let me not worry about it
18/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes yes it is clear
18/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes please go ahead
18/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Ohhh that's very convenient
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you
18/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes we are clear thank you for the assistance
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 698 9967: No ,I am in the City of Gweru
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Note ma'am
18/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 698 9967: You can go ahead and send them as it poses as another option
18/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
18/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you ma'am
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes quite clear we have discussed this before
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 698 9967: No queries at all let us continue
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

18/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Wooowwww
18/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
18/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
18/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Woow okay this is interesting
18/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day and weekend ahead.

18/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Have a great day too
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Promise!

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from LPU University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Good afternoon ma'am sorry for the late response I was having challenges connecting with you
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Yes we did have an opportunity to discuss the issue regarding the offer letter
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Well,we really are delighted to be witnessing this progress and it bring us such grate joy
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Generally the discussion was centered on the costs and what they are all for we all seemed to have a proper understanding of everything that is needed and we're delighted to see the next step forward
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 698 9967: No I don't have any questions so we can continue
20/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 698 9967: My network has been such a problem lately but I'm sure by the end of the day I will have acquired as much information as possible
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Ill definitely connect with her
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Let me do so now
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 698 9967: Thank you ma'am 😌
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 30, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I am not yet well versed in this information but I'll cross check with my parents on this
20/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand may I know a time by when your parents will be able to connect with us tomorrow?

20/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 698 9967: I'll try to be punctual
