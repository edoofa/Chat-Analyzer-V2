20/09/23, 10:36 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Emily,

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the above picture. I have taken note of it and I would need some clarification from you regarding the same. 

In the form, you have indicated the availability date as September 20th. However, as per our earlier discussions, I would like to remind you that your EWYL program was scheduled to commence on September 22nd (Friday). Therefore, it is important that we reflect this corrected date in the form. Could you kindly assist me with the same clarification?
20/09/23, 10:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time Emily, I am still waiting for the other pages of your EWYL Document and the Counseling Feedback form. May I know by when you would be able to share them with us?

I am sure you are aware that we are a bit behind in terms of completing the procedures for your admission counseling session, and we want to ensure that you are able to complete these procedures before the date of September 22nd. 

However, over the past few days, I have noticed that we have not been proactively moving forward with our discussion, and this has raised concerns regarding the completion of the procedures. Hence, I would like to understand the reason why you have not been able to connect with us in a timely manner and complete the tasks that were shared?
20/09/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 293 4866: I just wrote the date from which I would be available
20/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 293 4866: That is because of the network this side but I can make sure to send them today
20/09/23, 10:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Emily, and thank you for clarifying this. The next batch of students is supposed to commence their EWYL Program on the 22nd of September. As per our earlier discussions, we have been reiterating the same instructions with you so that you can keep a note of the timeline shared, ensure to complete the procedures on time, and plan your availability accordingly.

However, with the current rate of progress, I am a bit concerned that you may not be able to complete the procedures by Friday. If that is the case, and you feel that internet challenges are quite prominent, I can help you join the following batch of EWYL, which will be on the 26th of September. What are your thoughts on this?
20/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 293 4866: That would be very helpful
20/09/23, 11:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, Emily, in that case, we can help you commence your EWYL journey next week on Tuesday, which is the 26th of September. This will give you ample time to complete your admission procedures over the next few days. 

Hence, if you are confident and eager about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill in the same date in your EWYL Form by making the desired corrections accordingly. I hope we are together on this?
20/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
20/09/23, 11:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, Emily. Moving forward, I would like to inquire, by what time will you be able to share the forms with us so that we can reconnect at the same time and continue with our session?
20/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 293 4866: 6pm after I am back from school
20/09/23, 11:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay Emily, in that case, I would reconnect with you at 06:00 PM and I hope you will be able to share all the forms with us in due time. <This message was edited>

Thank you for sharing your academic documents and the required forms. Using block letters is recommended to ensure the forms are easily readable, but the form you've shared is clear, so we can proceed with it.

Additionally, regarding the EWYL document, it seems the first page is missing from the pictures you shared. Could you please double check and share the first page with me here?
20/09/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay I will
20/09/23, 7:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Emily, please do the same and then we will move forward with our discussion.
20/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 293 4866: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Fantastic Emily, everything is in order now. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey.
20/09/23, 8:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we can
20/09/23, 8:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 293 4866: I am done
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
20/09/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
20/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes they are
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
20/09/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you are following these two steps as well?
20/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
20/09/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/09/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/09/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
20/09/23, 8:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
20/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes they are
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, Emily. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps and if we are on the same page and both available for further discussion, shall we begin with the first step of the admission journey, which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we can
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright Emily. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes you can
20/09/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Fantastic Emily, let me share all the videos with you one by one -
20/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay

21/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 293 4866: I watched the videos
21/09/23, 9:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily

I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are Morningon the right path in your educational journey?
21/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 293 4866: What I understood from the videos is your concern us Africans and how you'll help me to apply for a university in India
21/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 293 4866: There are two qualities of a successful Edoofians which are hardworking willing to go an extra mile and the vision of Edoofa to make employable students and making our education so affordable.You also work with top 250 schools in India you work with.Lastly the statement of purpose on which you'll sent my documents to different Indian Schools using my documents.
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Emily, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to students' career goals.
21/09/23, 12:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/09/23, 12:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
21/09/23, 9:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Brilliant Emily, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
21/09/23, 9:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As promised earlier, is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. 

Hence, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 07:30 PM
21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. Hence, please fill it out carefully. 

After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
21/09/23, 9:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. 

Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

22/09/23, 7:54 am - +263 71 293 4866: The terms "rights" and "duties" are often used in relation to one another, and it's important to understand the distinction between them. In general, a "right" is something that a person is entitled to, while a "duty" is something that a person is obligated to do. For example, a person has the right to life, liberty, and property, but they also have the duty to obey the law and pay taxes.
Human rights are rights that are guaranteed to all people, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, or any other factor.Human rights are often divided into two categories: civil and political rights, and social, economic, and cultural rights. Civil and political rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person; freedom from torture and cruel treatment; freedom of expression and opinion; freedom of religion; the right to a fair trial; and freedom from discrimination. These rights are often enshrined in national constitutions and international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
22/09/23, 8:41 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same @263712934866. Once you complete the entire two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? 

This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
22/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 293 4866: Today
22/09/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 293 4866: A prosecutor and an attorney are both types of lawyers, but they have very different roles in the legal system. A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases, while an attorney is a lawyer who represents a private individual or organization. A prosecutor's job is to present evidence and argue that a person is guilty of a crime, while an attorney's job is to defend their client and argue for their innocence. In short, a prosecutor seeks to prove guilt, while an attorney seeks to prove innocence.A prosecutor might work for the state or the federal government. They would prosecute someone accused of a crime by presenting the evidence against them and making an argument that the accused is guilty. For example, a prosecutor might present evidence that the accused was at the scene of the crime, or that they have a motive to commit the crime. An attorney, on the other hand, would represent the accused individual and present evidence and arguments that they are not guilty. The attorney might present evidence that the accused was not at the scene of the crime, or that they had no motive to commit the crime.
22/09/23, 8:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That's great to hear, Emily! Thank you for your quick response. We appreciate your commitment to completing the tasks today. Once you've finished them, please feel free to reach out, and we'll coordinate our discussion accordingly to move forward with the next steps in your university admission process.
22/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 293 4866: Civil law because it helps to solve disputes among individual contracts plus I am good at problem solving skills and always ready to listen to the perspective of others
22/09/23, 9:42 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Noted @263712934866. Please go and share the responses to the other questions. We will reconnect with each other once you share all your responses.
22/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay I will
22/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 293 4866: I believe I can qualify in this area because I am a great listener and good at communicating with other and have good negotiation skills
22/09/23, 10:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright Emily, I have taken a note of this response as well.
22/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 293 4866: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 5:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily, 

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. Thank you for sharing your responses, we have taken note of them and will update them in our records as well. 

In addition to your responses, I would like to inquire whether you have been able to submit your Statement of Purpose (SOP) form as well. The SOP is an essential part of your application, providing valuable insights into your goals and motivations for pursuing your chosen path of study.
23/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I did
25/09/23, 8:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily

Please excuse me for not being able to continue with our discussion the other day, since it was a weekend, I couldn't attend to your message. 

However, I was able to go through your application file over the weekend and it seems as if the statement of purpose form was not submitted. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 8:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Could you please verify whether the form has been submitted on your end and let me know the status? Your quick response will greatly assist us in ensuring the completion of your application process.
25/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 293 4866: I think I am having a misunderstanding in which of the forms is the statement of purpose
25/09/23, 3:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright Emily, let me help you with the same. The statement of purpose form is the online form that I shared with you on Friday. For your ease, I have reverted to the same. Can you please check and confirm if you were able to fill it in?
25/09/23, 3:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (26th September 2023).
25/09/23, 3:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

26/09/23, 9:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you well and you are in high spirits. In reference to our conversation yesterday, I wanted to follow up and inquire whether you have had the opportunity to check for the statement of purpose form and if you have successfully joined the EWYL group and connected with your mentor?
26/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 293 4866: I have joined the EWYL group and connected with my mentor but I will complete the statement of purpose today
26/09/23, 10:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update regarding your EWYL Program. It's great to hear that you have connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. and I appreciate you sharing the same with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for your sessions scheduled with her. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for your academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!

This information will allow me to ensure my schedule is clear and that we can reconnect at the agreed-upon time.

26/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
26/09/23, 10:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Great, Emily. In that case, let's plan to reconnect at 06:00 PM. When you're available, please send a message to the group, and we'll quickly reconnect and resume our discussion. Looking forward to our continued conversation!
26/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Emil,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Following our recent conversation, I was expecting to receive a message from your end yesterday to continue our discussion and make progress in your admission journey. However, as I didn't hear from you, I wanted to reach out and ensure that we are still connected and in sync with each other.
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I would also like to inquire about the status of your statement of purpose. Have you made any progress on that front, and do you have any updates to share?

Your prompt response will help us proceed efficiently and effectively with your admission process. Please feel free to share any information or questions you may have.
27/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Hie sorry for the inconveniences caused I was having problems with my network but I have submitted the statement of purpose
28/09/23, 7:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I fully understand that occasional network issues can pose challenges and delay your procedures, please know that there's absolutely no need to apologize.

On a positive note, I'm delighted to inform you that we have successfully received your completed Statement of Purpose form.
28/09/23, 7:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With these accomplishments in mind, we have successfully completed the first and second steps of your admission journey. Now, let us eagerly step into the third step of your admission journey – the important stage of university admission counseling. This is where we will navigate the path to your academic aspirations together.
28/09/23, 7:56 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you have selected for your higher education is a Bachelor's degree in Legislative Law and it's my understanding that you're planning for your arrival in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it is accurate
28/09/23, 9:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Emily and thank you for understanding. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 9:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/09/23, 9:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/09/23, 9:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
28/09/23, 9:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Emily. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 9:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. 

Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/09/23, 9:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/09/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
28/09/23, 9:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.
28/09/23, 9:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/09/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
28/09/23, 9:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
28/09/23, 9:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
28/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
28/09/23, 10:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/09/23, 10:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
28/09/23, 10:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/09/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay
28/09/23, 10:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Emily. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa. I hope you are clear with this?
28/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
28/09/23, 10:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I would like to inquire if you have any questions regarding how the admission process unfolds and what the associated costs will be for your admission and your pursuit of higher education.

If you don't have any questions at this time, I have some exciting news to share with you. Please let me know your preference so that we can proceed with our discussion accordingly.
28/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 293 4866: We can proceed
29/09/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. I wanted to provide you with an update following our last discussion - I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully completed step 3 of the admission process. 

Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/09/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/09/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/09/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Noted
29/09/23, 4:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, indeed Emily. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
29/09/23, 4:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/09/23, 4:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
29/09/23, 4:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Thank you
29/09/23, 5:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Emily. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/09/23, 5:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/09/23, 5:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plan brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year to retake the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/09/23, 5:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 293 4866: I have reviewed them
29/09/23, 5:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/09/23, 5:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, you will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/09/23, 5:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, Emily, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning you as a frontiersperson in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay noted
29/09/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan. Let me help you introduce the second benefit as well.
29/09/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I am also delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/09/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain your fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/09/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of admission, you will remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
29/09/23, 5:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you've grasped this concept as well. Let us move to the third benefit of the endowment plan -
29/09/23, 5:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

When you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
29/09/23, 5:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate as well with you?
29/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it does
29/09/23, 5:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I am delighted to know that you are following through. Moving forward, in situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/09/23, 5:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/09/23, 5:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far?
29/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I have
29/09/23, 5:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Emily. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I would like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 293 4866: I am not aware of it
29/09/23, 6:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/09/23, 6:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/09/23, 6:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/09/23, 6:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
29/09/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I do
29/09/23, 6:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay Emily. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
29/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
29/09/23, 6:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: So Emily, in such a.case, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
29/09/23, 6:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Right Emily, so let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one - <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 6:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Reappear in A Level [Benefit Number 5]*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/09/23, 6:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/09/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
29/09/23, 6:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree [Benefit Number 6]*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
29/09/23, 6:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
29/09/23, 6:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
29/09/23, 6:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career [Benefit Number 7]*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
04/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Not yet
04/10/23, 4:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I completely understand, Emily, and that is perfectly fine. It is crucial for you to take your time to thoroughly review the offer letter, ensuring that when we start our discussion, you have a solid grasp of its contents and a clear perspective in mind. This will enable us to have a productive conversation.

With that in mind, could you please let me know when you anticipate being able to complete your review of the letter and when you will be available for our discussion? This will help us schedule a suitable time to connect with you.
05/10/23, 11:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Following our brief discussion yesterday, I have been eagerly awaiting your response to schedule our discussion and review your offer letter from Galgotias University. However, as I did not receive a reply from you, I wanted to reach out to you once more today.

Hence, could you please confirm whether you had the opportunity to review my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
05/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are connected we can continue today
05/10/23, 11:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am also glad to hear that Emily and I hope you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
05/10/23, 11:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
05/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 293 4866: 1.$900
2.5years
3.$500
4.$750
06/10/23, 11:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Emily,

I trust you are in good health and in high spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to continue our conversation yesterday. Unfortunately, I was unavailable at the time you replied to my messages.
06/10/23, 11:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, I was able to go through the responses you shared yesterday, thank you for sharing the same. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Good evening

Sorry for being unavailable today
06/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it does
06/10/23, 10:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That's perfectly fine, Emily. I completely understand that life can get busy, and there's no need to apologize. I'm pleased that we've been able to connect and make progress. Since we have reconnected, let us move ahead. I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
06/10/23, 10:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
06/10/23, 10:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
06/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Noted
06/10/23, 10:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your active engagement in our discussion, Emily. With this, I am certain you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and doesn't rush when it comes to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the importance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make an informed decision about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this aligns with your understanding of the university's approach?
06/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
07/10/23, 7:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Emily. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
07/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for the delay in responding to your message, as it was the weekend, and our team was unavailable. This situation resulted in a pause in our communication and progress.
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: During this brief disconnect, I had the opportunity to reflect on our previous conversations. Over the past few days, I noticed that our discussions regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University haven't been as seamless as we would prefer, mainly due to the time zone differences.
09/10/23, 5:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that in mind, I wanted to reach out today to address this specific concern and explore a more effective way to move forward. Could you kindly share your availability for a discussion about your offer letter? This will allow us to plan a conversation that accommodates both our schedules and ensures a smoother and more productive exchange of information.
09/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Can we do it at 8 in the evening
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, Emily, 08:00 PM in the evening works perfectly for our discussion. I will mark that down, and we will connect at that time. Please feel free to prepare any questions you would like to discuss regarding the offer letter or any other aspects of your admission. 

Looking forward to our conversation at 08:00 in the evening!
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Emily,

Following our earlier discussion, I wanted to reach out to you once again and inquire about your availability for our scheduled discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University?
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Greetings

We can continue our session for today
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for making yourself available for our scheduled discussion, I am pleased to see that you are available for our discussion. Without any more delay, I would like to commence our conversation regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University and ensure you have a clear understanding of the offer letter and its specifics.

In our previous conversation, we covered the tuition fee, accommodation fee, food fee, and examination fee mentioned in your letter. Today, we will continue by discussing the admission processing and registration fees that are due. Are you prepared to proceed with the same Emily?
09/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we can
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Emily. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes please
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a student/parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 18th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 18th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *October 18th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
10/10/23, 3:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Emily. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/10/23, 3:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
10/10/23, 3:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
10/10/23, 3:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
10/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
10/10/23, 3:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay Emily. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
10/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Thank you
10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 362 7421: Good afternoon please can we make a payment plan of amounts because l cannot provide half of the amounts within 15 days
10/10/23, 3:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you as well, @263773627421 

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is great to see that you are connected and actively engaged in our discussion. Thank you for sharing your concern, and please know that we are fully committed to helping you navigate this challenge and providing you with the best possible solution.

Before we delve into addressing the specific concern you have raised, @263773627421, I would like to conclude the discussion we've been having regarding the offer letter. Therefore, I would like to inquire if you feel comfortable proceeding with our discussion on the same. By doing so, we can ensure that you have all the necessary details at your disposal, allowing you to plan your next steps with clarity and then we can discuss the concern regarding Emily's registration fee due as well.
10/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 362 7421: Oky
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you @263773627421. To continue with our conversation, I would like to enquire if you were able to go through this message of mine and if we are together to continue with our discussion from here on?
11/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 362 7421: Yes we can continue
11/10/23, 10:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263773627421.  Now that we have established Emily's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/10/23, 10:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
12/10/23, 6:03 am - +263 77 362 7421: Yes
12/10/23, 6:04 am - +263 77 362 7421: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 6:04 am - +263 77 362 7421: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 8:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion @263773627421. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Emily with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
12/10/23, 8:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
12/10/23, 8:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Emily can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
12/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Noted
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Emily. Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to share a few glimpses of the university and emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
12/10/23, 4:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
12/10/23, 4:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Saturday. We can address any queries you may have, discuss the concern you shared regarding the registration fee due, and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

12/10/23, 4:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Emily. Also, rest assured that the payment receipt you shared above for your remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee has been taken note of and we have updated the team as well. 

For now, we will be concluding our conversation. Wishing you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our warm regards to your family. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us here in your admission group. 

We are here to support you every step of the way.
12/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
17/10/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Emily,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. I want to extend my apologies for not being able to reconnect with you on Saturday as planned. We had some crucial meetings with one of our affiliated universities, MVN University
17/10/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These meetings were focused on discussing the endowment benefits for the 2024 academic year, and hence, they were unavoidable. Due to these unexpected commitments, we couldn't connect with you earlier, and we appreciate your patience during this time.
17/10/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That being said, I am relieved and glad to inform you that we are now available to continue our discussion, and our focus can shift back to your admission process. If you and your family are available, I would like to inquire if we can reconnect and resume our conversation from where we left off?
17/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we can
17/10/23, 9:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, Emily. As a must have taken note that we held a meeting with MVN University the past couple of days. 

I am sure you will be pleased to hear that we took advantage of this opportunity to expedite your scholarship application with the university. 

I am delighted to inform you that our efforts have proven successful, as the university has accepted her application and provided us with your scholarship offer letter. Below, you will find the same offer letter for your review.

Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐ <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 9:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 11:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to follow up on the exciting updates we shared with you yesterday regarding your university admission. Have you had the chance to review my previous messages and take note of the offer letter shared with you?

Your response is crucial to us, as it will allow us to schedule a discussion and get into the offer letter details thoroughly. We value your timely response and hence, look forward to connecting with you at your earliest to move forward with the next steps in your admission cycle.
18/10/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 293 4866: I have gone through the offer later so we can proceed
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Emily. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure his scholarship seat?
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - +263 71 293 4866: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
19/10/23, 8:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details Emilu. As you can see in your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
19/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes
19/10/23, 1:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now Emily, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education at MVN University is $1,600.

In continuation of our discussion regarding your offer letter, as you can see in her offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments: the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means her total expenses for the first year amount to $1,600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1,850.

It's important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1,600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it does
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Emily Now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I have
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing to hear that Emily. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it is
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now Emily, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it does
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Thank you
19/10/23, 5:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. With that said, let us not shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
19/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Okay so we are when is it needed
19/10/23, 5:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Let us come to that as well Emily. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
19/10/23, 5:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason your per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
19/10/23, 5:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it does
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier just like the offer you have from Galgotias University.
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this Emily?
19/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Noted
19/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 293 4866: I would prefer the one which allows us to save although the registration amount is higher
19/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I do
19/10/23, 5:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Emily. Now talking about the registration fee, let's turn our focus to the registration fee outlined in your offer letter. As mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in her offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after she arrives in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850.
19/10/23, 5:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This remaining fee of $850 will be required to be paid after you arrive in India. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $425 and $425, with a six-month gap between them.

The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of your arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
19/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we have
19/10/23, 5:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*.
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes please
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
19/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Emily. Regarding the payment method for your university registration fee at MVN Univeristy, we discussed this earlier when we reviewed your offer letter from Galgotias University and the details remain the same. Therefore, I would like to ask if you remember that discussion and whether you have access to the account details for the payment of your university registration fee, or if you would like us to revisit this topic?
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Emily,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from MVN University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 362 7421: Yes we are working on it
20/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we are
20/10/23, 11:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That's great to hear, and I am glad to know youa re actively working on the payment process. With that said, since we were in the middle of our discussion regarding your offer letter from MVN University, may I inquire if we can proceed with our discussion right now so that we aim to complete it today? This way, you will have all the necessary details, and you can focus on completing your child's university admission formalities in a timely manner.
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Emily!
I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 08:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Thank you
17/11/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Emily!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I was going through your discussion that you had with Ms. Vilsha earlier about the offer letter from MVN University. 

About that, cacn you please help me in understanding more about how is it that you are planning to raise the fee for the same?
24/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 293 4866: My parents are still looking for the money so I haven't confirmed if they have it yet
24/11/23, 7:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, may I know if you have discussed the same with your parents yet?
24/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes

25/11/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, it is good to know that you had a discussion with your parents. Now, as per the discussion, can you please let me know how much money have your parents raised for your admission process till now?
25/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 293 4866: Okay
25/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 293 4866: I need to first confirm
25/11/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when would you be able to discuss that with them?
25/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Tomorrow
25/11/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you would be able to share an update with me on that by Monday, right?
25/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I will
25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. We will then connect with each other here on Monday.
28/11/23, 9:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily!
I hope you are doing well today.

I am writing to follow up on our previous conversation regarding your admission process. As per our discussion, you were planning to discuss the matter of raising the fee for the offer letter from MVN University with your parents.

I understand that these discussions can take some time, so I wanted to check in and see if you have had a chance to speak with your parents. If so, could you please provide me with an update on their decision?
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 293 4866: Well my parents managed to raise $200
29/11/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emily!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, moving ahead, I wanted to inform you that the I had a discussion with the university officials as well as the academic board and they have informed me that they are going to close the current round of admissions by tomorrow, i.e. month end. And once that is done, the students who did not manage to complete their admission in time, they will be losing on the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the grant they have received. 

Therefore, if a student wants to make sure that they receive the benefits and the grant, in that case, what they have to do is that they would have to pay the first part of the fee by tomorrow. Now since you have already managed to raise $200 by now, in that case, what you can do is that you can move ahead to make the payment of that by tomorrow so that on the basis of the same I can have a discussion with the officials and get your seat reserved with the Grant as well as the Endowment Plan Benefits. I hope this is understood?
