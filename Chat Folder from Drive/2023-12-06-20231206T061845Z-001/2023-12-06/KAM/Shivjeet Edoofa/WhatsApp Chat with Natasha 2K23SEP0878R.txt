Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/10/23, 8:06 pm - +260 96 4184949: Good evening. Yes I'm available
05/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
05/10/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
05/10/23, 8:51 pm - +260 96 4184949: We can start
05/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 9:00 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes I ve gone through
05/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/10/23, 9:03 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes they are clear
05/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/10/23, 9:15 pm - +260 96 4184949: Following sir
05/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/10/23, 9:17 pm - +260 96 4184949: It's clear
05/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/10/23, 9:19 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes go ahead
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/10/23, 9:34 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes move forward

06/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, may I know if you were not able to go though the videos at all?
06/10/23, 8:38 pm - +260 96 4184949: I have gone through
06/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
06/10/23, 11:25 pm - +260 96 4184949: Video 1
Two important things for the enrolled students are:
1.Students should be teachable and open minded. This will help students to be independent as they work in the community which will help students to earn scholarship credits 
2. Students should follow Edoofa's istructions

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
07/10/23, 4:36 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes I'm available
09/10/23, 8:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Natasha. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. It was the weekend, and my available hours end a bit early.

With that being said, I will be connecting with you this evening at 5:00 PM for further continuation of our session.
09/10/23, 9:53 am - +260 95 7783862: Thanks so much
09/10/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - +260 95 7783862: Let’s go ahead please
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
09/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
09/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
09/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - +260 95 7783862: We are on the same page
09/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

10/10/23, 2:33 pm - +260 95 7783862: How do I send the voice note?
10/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You can press the microphone icon on your phone and speak to it.
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
10/10/23, 6:23 pm - +260 95 7783862: To become an aerospace engineer, you'll need a strong foundation in math and physics to understand the principles behind flight and spacecraft design. Problem-solving skills are crucial for identifying and solving complex engineering challenges. Additionally, computer programming skills are important for designing and simulating aerospace systems. It's an exciting field that combines science, technology, and innovation.
Aerodynamics theories are used in aerospace engineering to understand how air flows around aircraft and spacecraft. This knowledge helps engineers design efficient and stable vehicles that can overcome air resistance and generate lift. Aerodynamics theories are used in aerospace engineering to understand how air flows around aircraft and spacecraft. This knowledge helps engineers design efficient and stable vehicles that can overcome air resistance and generate lift.Some common lift augmentation devices used in aircraft are flaps, slats, and spoilers. Flaps and slats are movable surfaces on the wings that increase the wing area and change the shape of the wing, creating more lift during takeoff and landing. Spoilers, on the other hand, are used to reduce lift and increase drag, helping with speed control and descent. These devices play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and maneuverability of aircraft. 
In addition to flaps, slats, and spoilers, there are a few more lift augmentation devices used in aircraft. Have you heard of leading-edge devices like Krueger flaps and vortex generators? They help improve lift at low speeds. There are also devices called winglets or wingtip devices that reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. These advancements in aerodynamics make flying safer and more efficient. 
Lastly, In aviation, there are several main areas or disciplines. Some of the key areas include commercial aviation, military aviation, general aviation, and aerospace engineering. Each area has its own unique focus and purpose, contributing to the advancement and operation of aircraft. It's a fascinating field with endless possibilities!
10/10/23, 6:25 pm - +260 95 7783862: 🖕question 2-5
10/10/23, 6:26 pm - +260 95 7783862: For the voice note she’s still in school

17/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I understand that exams can create a busy environment at schools. Patience is key, and we want to ensure all necessary documents are acquired when the time is right. Please keep me informed once you have any updates, and if there's anything else I can assist you with in the meantime, feel free to let me know.

28/10/23, 2:03 pm - +260 95 7783862: Monday
30/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear Parents and Natasha.

So, let us connect tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
02/11/23, 11:05 am - +260 95 7783862: I will collect a recommendation letter from her school on Saturday
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Natasha.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as I was on a leave on account of my birthday.

That said, I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 12:45 pm - +260 96 4184949: We can proceed Sir
02/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey while we wait for the documents, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes
02/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
02/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
02/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
02/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/11/23, 2:45 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes
02/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
02/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
02/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
02/11/23, 3:44 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes
02/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes sir
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
02/11/23, 3:49 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
02/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
02/11/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 3:55 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
02/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you have any concerns that you would like to share?
02/11/23, 3:59 pm - +260 95 7783862: It’s clear
02/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cI am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
02/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
02/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:03 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
02/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
02/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 7:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Natasha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we will be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 14th of November. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 14th of November so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. May I know when you might be able to correct the form?

I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled hours as I was on leave. Please, how are you and your family doing today?
15/11/23, 6:24 pm - +260 96 4184949: Fine Sir good to hear from you

I hope you have a great night today and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
16/11/23, 12:41 am - +260 96 4184949: Thanks so much
16/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Natasha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 10:20 pm - +260 96 4184949: Sorry sir I was busy with supervision of exams
17/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings,

It is alright please let me know when you are ready so that we can proceed with the session.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - +260 96 4184949: I'm ready sir
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
17/11/23, 7:55 pm - +260 95 7783862: 1. The admission process begins with the message from the founders of Edoofa.
2. Statement of purpose.
3. Counseling Session on the University.
4. Offer letter from colleges/Universities.
5. University Registration & Admission Acceptance Letter.
6. VISA application Process.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct now, with further continuation.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +260 95 7783862: O yes
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes sir it’s clear
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay like how we paid the $350 in two parts I understand
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - +260 95 7783862: Provide information please
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
17/11/23, 8:59 pm - +260 96 4184949: Understood. On A levels the school doesn't have unless O levels
17/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*

17/11/23, 9:14 pm - +260 95 7783862: Password 12NS004
18/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Natasha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if the document provided if not from the examination counsil?
18/11/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 4184949: It's from the dchool
18/11/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 4184949: Her g9 certificate i will collect in Tuesday that's when she's writing her last paper
20/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. I shall wait for the remaining documents. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 6:06 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes sir I'm ready
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - +260 95 7783862: Ok let me discuss with her tomorrow I’m picking her from school she will be done with her exams.
20/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds like a good plan. Discussing it with her after she's finished with her exams will provide the right time to weigh the options and make an informed decision.
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - +260 96 4184949: Yes yes Sir
20/11/23, 8:12 pm - +260 96 4184949: So for one to an engineering program he/she needs to do A levels?
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it is needed. However, as the universities have started their admissions early and almost all your peers have completed the admission process, we can proceed with the application along with the letter of recommendation from the Scholl instead of A level (which is equivalent to Grade 12)."
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - +260 96 4184949: A recommendation i sent to you
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will work perfectly fine
20/11/23, 8:32 pm - +260 96 4184949: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that again.
21/11/23, 5:50 pm - +260 95 7783862: Good evening
21/11/23, 5:50 pm - +260 95 7783862: It’s Natasha I’m back from school
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. How was your exams, dear?
21/11/23, 5:52 pm - +260 95 7783862: They were hard but fair thank you
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
21/11/23, 6:02 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes I did recall
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 95 7783862: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the grae 9 results with me.
21/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - +260 95 7783862: How long is a diploma???
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - +260 95 7783862: And if I have to do A-levels I’m I supposed to do it from Zambia???
21/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you have written your Grade 12 exams?
21/11/23, 7:11 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes I have
21/11/23, 7:11 pm - +260 95 7783862: I just finished today
21/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Then it is alright and the A level mentioned here is the same as grade 12, dear. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 7:25 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay then
21/11/23, 7:26 pm - +260 95 7783862: So what’s the way forward
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For now, I shall proceed with the session. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/11/23, 7:39 pm - +260 95 7783862: I’m not clear
21/11/23, 7:40 pm - +260 95 7783862: On this point
21/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: These are the benefits of the endowment that I have been discussing with you. I would like you to please go through the conversation so that you have a better understanding of the same, dear.
21/11/23, 7:43 pm - +260 95 7783862: Oh I now understand
21/11/23, 7:44 pm - +260 95 7783862: What’s the way forward???
21/11/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to understand our conversation now?
21/11/23, 7:47 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes
21/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/11/23, 7:49 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes I do concerning the costs and the admission process
21/11/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The exact details will be there in the offer letter mentioned by the university. If you want to go through a rough estimate, we could discuss it as well. Please refer to our previous discussion for the same, dear.
21/11/23, 8:29 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
21/11/23, 8:45 pm - +260 95 7783862: Can we proceed?
21/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
21/11/23, 8:57 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes very much
21/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
21/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/11/23, 9:00 pm - +260 95 7783862: Noted thank you.
22/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Natasha.

22/11/23, 9:39 pm - +260 95 7783862: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you dear
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Natasha!
