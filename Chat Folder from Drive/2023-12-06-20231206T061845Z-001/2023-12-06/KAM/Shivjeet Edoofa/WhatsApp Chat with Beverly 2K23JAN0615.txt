18/10/23, 5:24 am - +263 71 263 4381: Yes I remember

20/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 263 4381: I am available now sir 
If it's possible we may continue with the session
20/10/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly,
20/10/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
20/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Sir I think I already received my offer letter
20/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 263 4381: If it's the one wich was emailed to me and made the first pay installment of $350

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?
20/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good evening sir

I trust that you are in good health and experiencing blessings. Regrettably, I was unable to engage further with you when you reached out, as it was outside my available hours at that time. It is alright. 

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
21/10/23, 7:53 am - +263 71 263 4381: I am active sir we may proceed
21/10/23, 7:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you might be able to give me a reply on this message?
21/10/23, 8:00 am - +263 71 263 4381: Well personally I think this is the stage were we get an offer letter from a university I am to study at and all
21/10/23, 8:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 8:28 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 263 4381: That's correct sir

The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/10/23, 9:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:04 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians.

21/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 263 4381: I am ready sir
21/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 263 4381: I went through the benefits sir
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 263 4381: Noting
21/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 71 263 4381: It resonates well sir
21/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 263 4381: This means the fees structure remains constant right
21/10/23, 11:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Exactly.
21/10/23, 11:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 11:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 263 4381: Yes sir 
I understood
21/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon as it is the weekend. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Beverly!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good afternoon sir 
We had  a lovely weekend 
How was yours?
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: it was great, thank you for asking. Shall we proceed with the session?
29/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good day sir
30/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good evening sir 
May we proceed this evening?
30/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, may I know if you are ready?
02/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers and their parents, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
03/11/23, 7:13 am - +263 71 263 4381: Good morning sir

04/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 263 4381: No questions yet we may kindly proceed
04/11/23, 11:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

18/11/23, 10:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

20/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Beverly!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good afternoon sir 
We may proceed with the session it's alright 
Although network is tripping due to the rain today
20/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, despite the network issues. Let's proceed with our session. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 263 4381: 1)$900
2)5 years 
3)$300
4)$100
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 5-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 263 4381: It's well clarified sir thank you
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Alright I think the last option is better and affordable @$800 yearly
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Indeed they are very thoughtful sir .
May I ask ?
If a person lives off campus are they places near campus so as to save transport costs
20/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, they are. The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.

Coming to more about safety, the accommodations are guarded by security guards with 24-hour CCTV surveillance, and you will be living with your local friends as a community, which gives you pride and strength. Please let me know if you are clear here as well.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 263 4381: All clear sir 🫡
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Clear sir 👌
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 263 4381: We may move forward
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 263 4381: We are together so I need to pay a sum of $750 before 1st
20/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that very soon, please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Noted
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Good afternoon sir 
My apologies as I was not online when you sent the message
21/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, may I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session?
21/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 263 4381: It's alright we may proceed
21/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Yes please explain sir
21/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 263 4381: All clear sir
21/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 263 4381: I reside In Harare yes
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 263 4381: Alright thanks sir
21/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 71 263 4381: I will speak to my dad and see wich payment method is better but I think paying physically to Mr Rajan is a better method
21/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, in any case. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were abel to recieve the details?
22/11/23, 6:12 am - +263 71 263 4381: Good morning sir 
Thanks I received the details
23/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Beverly!

I hope you are doing well today. It's been a couple of days since you were last online, and I wanted to inform you that this delay has affected the offer letter, and potentially might cause a loss of this opportunity. I understand you might be facing technical challenges at the moment which has led to your phone being turned off due to power challenges.

However, as this letter is crucial for your higher education, I'd like to suggest that if any of your family members are available online, you could sit with them and continue this conversation with me or use their device or I can have a conversation with them. This could help us better understand your university's needs behind this offer letter and the financial preparations ahead.  So, without hesitation please inform me when you're active and ready to proceed with this discussion.
23/11/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 345 6829: Good day  I'm Mr Joseph mudzimba Beverly s father I'm busy at work let me take off tomorrow then we proceed
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, Mr. Mudzimba. Your availability tomorrow works well for us to continue the discussion. I understand work commitments can be demanding. So may I know if you would be able to proceed with the same at 3:00 PM?
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - +27 83 345 6829: Yes tomorrow it's fine I will be
23/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great to hear, Mr. Mudzimba. I'll make sure to be available at 3:00 PM tomorrow to continue our discussion. If there's anything specific you'd like to address during our conversation, please feel free to let me know. Looking forward to our discussion tomorrow!
25/11/23, 8:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Beverly!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to have a conversation the previous day as I was occupied with unforseen work. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together.
29/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 263 4381: Good morning sir 
I am very sad and disheartened 😔 to tell you that I might not be able to continue with the process since my dad lost his Job due to the company closing because of some major losses and this then means my Father will not be able to finance my academic expenses as of now .😢as I write this I'm crying  ,I waited a few days to tell you hoping that things would change but since the first of December is approaching wich is the due date for paying the first $300 and right now my family is broke and can not afford to pay .I have to help by looking for a job but the money will not be enough still.
I'm humbly pleading with you if you can hold the process and maybe by the Grace of God I can go for the 2025 intake please 🙏

As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.
