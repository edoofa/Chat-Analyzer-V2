I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past two days, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.

02/09/23, 9:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Courtney,

I hope you are doing well, May I know if you have gone through the letter, We are waiting for your response.
02/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 158 9588: Yes we have gone through it
02/09/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Let us begin to discuss the same compliance notice by understanding what FRRO actually is. 

FRRO stands for Foreigners Regional Registration Office and every Individual regardless of the type of visa they carry in India has to register themselves on the online portal of FRRO within 14 days of arrival mandatorily.
02/09/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Since you are an International Student and are coming to study here in India, as per the norms of the Indian Government once you arrive in India you too will have to register for FRRO. The FRRO is the primary agency to regulate the registration, movement, stay, and departure, and also for recommending the extension of stay in India.
02/09/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Most of the International students have to do their FRRO process on their own, however since you are an Edoofian, your complete FRRO process will be taken care of by the university officials and they would guide you with all the procedures. Are you clear about this now?
02/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 158 9588: Yes mam
02/09/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are aware of the role the FRRO plays and how important it is for the students to complete the same in due time, as a student it is important for you to clear your first semester’s fee as per the timeline shared by the university so that your process can be carried out smoothly and you do not face any challenge in India.
02/09/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Considering the same, the university has advised and encouraged the students to clear the first-semester fee on or before the date of their arrival to India. Hence, may I know you are aware of your fee break up for your first semester?
02/09/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, May I know if you have successfully submitted your Online Visa Application Form, If yes, Kindly share your downloaded form with us here so  I can crosscheck all the details and ensure everything is accurate. This will help us move forward with the next steps in the process smoothly.
02/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 158 9588: No l haven't submitt
02/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 158 9588: Forgive me for replying late am  not feeling well today
02/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 158 9588: No am not aware
04/09/23, 10:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Courtney,

@263781589588 How's your health now?
04/09/23, 10:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: May I please now if you are facing any challenges in submitting your form?
04/09/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: That's alright. Let me help you with the breakup of your fee to ensure we are on the same page. As per your offer letter, your per-semester fee breakup is as follows:
1. Tuition Fee Per Annum - $900
2. Examination Fee Per Annum - $100

Now, when you add up both of these components, your per-annum cost of education that is due to the university becomes $900 + $100 = $1000
04/09/23, 10:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: Since you have already paid the registration fee of $750 through Edoofa to reserve your scholarship seat, the same amount has been adjusted toward your first year's fee due to the university. This leaves a remaining balance of $1000 - $750 = $250

It is important to note that this fee of $250 is to be cleared before or on your arrival at the university. This will ensure a smooth transition and allow you to fully engage in your academic journey. Can you please confirm if this information is clear to you?

They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
11/09/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
11/09/23, 12:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Courtney 2K23MAR1742*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
11/09/23, 12:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us.
