23/08/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright let us conclude our discussion. Have a great day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Abisai!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
01/09/23, 6:04 am - +263 78 326 0958: We are doing well Mr. Milan.Yes we can have the discussion now.
01/09/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/09/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Medical Laboratory Technology.
01/09/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
01/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 326 0958: Yes Mr. Milan.I would be interested.
01/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 326 0958: To know more about the course.
01/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 326 0958: May I ask why are you reconsidering my application?
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Abisai, your application is being reconsidered as a part of a whole batch of students who were shortlisted for the opportunity that the academic board is offering here in which they get the chance to study a much better course that can lead them to have a better career with the costs being cut down to a huge margin to ensure that they can be comfortable with the finances of their higher education as well. Is that clear now>
02/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 326 0958: When I finished my A level course I was willing to study biochemical engineering.I was offered biochemistry,so I decided to dedicate on biochemistry since I aspire to be a biochemist.Now I am prepared for the course and my parents are prepared for the financial burden after the 50% scholarship offered to us by pdm and we are very grateful for the scholarship.In my opinion Biochemistry is a better degree than MLT.
02/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 306 9115: Mr Milan can I know the reason why you are reconsidering my son's program  yet we have been told by Ms Ashni last week about her guiding us on the visa process .We are now in a confusion state can you please let us know why
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me also help you in understanding more about why is it that we have reconsidered Talent's application:

1. Abisai's application is being reconsidered as a part of a whole batch of students who were shortlisted for the opportunity that the academic board is offering here in which they get the chance to study a much better course that can lead them to have a better career with the costs being cut down to a huge margin to ensure that they can be comfortable with the finances of their higher education as well. Is that clear now.
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. Just recently the university experience rankings and overall rankings were released among the educational partners here in India and in that, PDM University did not do quite well while MVN was among the top performers. Additionally, the response that we are receiving from the side of the students at PDM University has not been too good in terms of the experience that they are getting. Now, we want to make sure that each one of our students should get the best while they are here in India.

I hope you are clear with this?
05/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 306 9115: Is it not possible to find another course which is better than lab tech
05/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 306 9115: Noted
05/09/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 386 6044: Yes we had wished that Abisai take the same programme that he had been offered initially at PDM. The change of programme at short notice may inconvinience both him and us as parents, since we had taken our time to get a better understanding of the programme offered (Bsc Bio-Chemistry) and career options available. I think the the initial programme was taken, on the understanding that it was almost like Bio- Chemical Engineering that our son had initially wanted to take and had applied for. 
We would have loved to be consulted on different programmes that could be on offer for Abisai and any limitations and challenges associated with other progrmmes , than just being informed of just one option at the last minutes. Under convenient circumstances, we would not make a choice in MLT for him, through our understanding  of the programme here in Zimbabwe. We however stand to be guided, but if there is room for another option, which could be more lucrative for Abisai, we would opt for it than Medical Laboratory Technology.
05/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your perspective on the initial program. It's important for you as parents to make informed decisions about your son's education. Now, regarding the Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) program, I want to emphasize that it's a highly valuable and respected field in the healthcare sector.
05/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: While it may not be the exact program your son initially considered, MLT offers a promising and rewarding career. It's a field where he can make a meaningful impact on public health and further his education in related disciplines if he wishes.

I understand that you would like to explore other options, however, I encourage you to consider the potential benefits of the MLT program for Abisai's future and career prospects. I can assure you that it will turn out to be an excellent choice for his future. I hope you understand?
06/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 386 6044: I still have reservations with that programme ( MLT) from the information that I have about it. Can you kindly give an outline of the career path for an MLT graduate so that I as a parent don't work on assumptions. 
On the other hand, would you not suggest or even provide some other program  or related fields (related to BSc in Biochemistry) so that we can come out with a better programme of choice, notwithstanding the fact that his academic qualifications of course, play a bigger part in determining the programmes that Abisai is qualified for. 
Please allow him and us as parents to make an informed decision. It's not  in our best interest as parents to just send our child for further education without full knowledge of the full content of the program and the exact benefit of that program upon completion. Sending a child for tertiary education abroad in not an ordinary thing, and to us, it shouldn't be a doubtful investment.
07/09/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns, and it's important for you as parents to make informed decisions about your son's education. I appreciate your desire to gather more information about the Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) program and explore other potential options. Let me provide you with an outline of the career path for an MLT graduate.
07/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) Career Path:

1. Medical Laboratory Technologists (MLTs) play a crucial role in the healthcare industry. They are responsible for conducting various laboratory tests and analyses, helping doctors diagnose and treat patients effectively. Here's an overview of the career path for an MLT graduate:

2. Education: MLT programs typically include coursework in clinical chemistry, microbiology, hematology, and immunology. Students learn to operate sophisticated laboratory equipment and perform tests on blood, tissues, and other bodily fluids.

3. Clinical Training: MLT students also undergo supervised clinical training to gain hands-on experience in a real healthcare setting, such as a hospital or clinical laboratory.

4. Job Opportunities: MLTs can find employment in various healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, research laboratories, and diagnostic centers. They work closely with doctors and other healthcare professionals to provide accurate and timely test results.

5. Career Growth: MLTs have opportunities for career advancement. With experience and further education, they can specialize in areas like molecular diagnostics, histotechnology, or cytotechnology.
07/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 326 0958: Can I have  another course other than this one,please?
Maybe if you give me the chance to choose from my desired courses.
08/09/23, 9:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 9:28 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know why is that you wish to get another course apart from this please?
08/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 326 0958: This message was deleted
08/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 326 0958: I don't want to do MLT.From what you said above,MLTs will be conducting laboratory tests in clinics and hospitals and other health facilities,helping doctors treat patients.I'm not interested in that and the average salary of MLTs isn't desirable.I spoke to some students who are in India and they say the course isn't worth to travel and waste so many expenses.I was asking  students from my circle who went to India to pursue their studies.I was asking them which courses might be good to pursue in India for international science students,and they gave me some courses like computer engineering, dentistry,physiology and so on and they added up saying there are some courses that ain't worth to study like MLT.They gave me MLT as an example of worst courses for international students.When I applied to to Edoofa,I received  counselling.I wanted a program which involves biochemical processes,production of medicine,studying of biomolecules,production of materials which will be used in health sectors.I was offered biochemistry since it was related to what I was interested in.This course has various options like one can become a biochemist, biomedical scientist,pharmaceutologist,neurologist,Clinical Scientist and chemist.One can also work in education sectors.One can also further his education in related fields like neuroscience,medicine,pharmacy,biotechnology and so on.That's why I chose the program,with so many options I would be investing in something tangible.
09/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns, Abisai. I appreciate your honesty and your desire to make an informed decision about your higher education. It's essential that you choose a program that aligns with your interests and career goals. Let me address some of your concerns and provide additional insights about the MLT program:
09/09/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. In-Demand Field*: MLT is a highly in-demand field in the healthcare industry. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in disease diagnosis, patient care, and medical research. Your work would directly contribute to improving public health.

*2. Career Options*: While it's true that MLTs work in laboratories, the career options within this field are diverse. Here are a few paths you can explore as an MLT graduate:
    *a. Clinical Laboratory Technologist*: Performing diagnostic tests in a clinical laboratory.
    *b. Researcher:* Conducting experiments and research in medical laboratories.
    *c. Quality Control Analyst*: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of medical tests.
    *d. Teaching*: Sharing your knowledge as an educator in the field.

*3. Financial Considerations*: The scholarship opportunity for the MLT program offers substantial financial benefits, including a 90% tuition fee scholarship and 100% accommodation sponsorship. This can significantly reduce the financial burden on you and your parents while pursuing higher education in India.
09/09/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: While your initial choice of biochemistry is indeed a valuable field, it's essential to consider the specific opportunities and benefits that the MLT program, with its scholarship offer, can provide. I encourage you to weigh the potential long-term benefits and financial advantages of the MLT program against your current concerns. I hope you understand?
10/09/23, 7:52 am - +263 78 326 0958: How are you doing Mr. Milan?I greatly appreciate for being offered such a great scholarship percentage,this is exactly what parents especially from my country dream of.They dream for such an opportunity.However,the scholarship is great and I'm grateful,but the course isn't good for me.I don't want to see the day that I would regret that I took a program that I didn't feel well about just because I admired a good scholarship percentage.A point in space and time is going to come when I will be alone alongside with the desicion I made in the past.No one will be there alongside me.I want to do something that I feel well with.Life is all about dedicating to dreams and try to bring the best from what you aspire.I don't aspire to do MLT,please help me!
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty and your thoughtful consideration of your future, Abisai. It's clear that you have a strong desire to pursue a path that aligns with your passion and aspirations.

Now, since you have asked for my guidance, then being your admission officer here and having a rich experience of the education industry, I would like to say that you should go for the MLT course since it is advised by the academic board and it holds huge potential for you to excel in your career, I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 386 6044: Greetings Mr Milan Singh. I appreciate your explanation regarding the programme being offered to Abisai. Can you shade light on the aspect of programme  registrability in our home country especially basing on  the rating of the university in terms of standards and the credibility of the programme.
12/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for your question. I understand your concerns about program registrability and the credibility of the program and university in your home country. It's a valid consideration when making decisions about higher education.

MVN University, the institution offering the MLT program, is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which is the regulatory body for higher education in India. This recognition ensures that the university meets certain academic standards and quality requirements that are known internationally. Which means that having the program completed once, Abisai would be able to get a career in the same field very easily. I hope you understand? <This message was edited>
13/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion. Now, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the above message of mine so that we can proceed with our conversation and plan the nexts steps in Abisai's admission journey?
13/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 306 9115: Hello Mr Milan we are very sorry for late response but it's beyond our control
As a family we are in a confusion state we still don't know what to do and to opt for because all along we have been preparing for biochemistry suddenly it changed 
Decision making it's a bit difficult for us maybe if you can give us time  to discuss this because his father is out and where he is there is network challenge he is coming back Friday evening so if you can give us time so that we will come back to you on 16/09/23
13/09/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, you can take your time to discuss the same as a family and then let me know.
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 306 9115: Noted Mr Milan
16/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 326 0958: Good morning Mr. Milan.
16/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 326 0958: I had a conservation  with my parents concerning the course.I can't do MLT as my course.
16/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here, and if I may ask why is that you do not wish to pursue that course please?
16/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 386 6044: Greetings Mr Singh. We as a family had been counselling and guiding Abisai in the issue of his career. The first time he applied for acceptance into this programme, he had indicated that he wanted to pursue a program in Biochemical Engineering. He was advised to take BSc in Biochemistry, but that was not his original choice. Now from nowhere, he is being advised to take another programme(MLT).

 Mr Singh, I think you will appreciate, like we mentioned earlier on, that making a choice in a life long professional career, is not a minor issue especially considering that Abisai has to do it in a foreign country. 
The information we have gathered indicates that MLT is not as lucrative and worth investing in as it may seem. 
Secondly, let me also express my disappointment over the way you have handled this whole issue. You  shortchanged both our child and us, and this can simply  explain that you can take things for granted. Surely, how do you expect us to be happy with the way this whole thing is unfolding. It is only after we have met some of the requirements including payment of part of the fees, that you are giving us conditions that are not suitable for Abisai to take as a career. 
We as a family, are not compromising under whatever circumstance.
 *That is the family position.* 
Thank you.
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to have a discussion with you over call, may I know by when can we connect with each other for that?
22/09/23, 9:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 9:59 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier, when you had shared your thoughts on Abisai's admission process here. For that, I also wanted to have a discussion with you here, however, due to some challenges that you may have faced, you were not able to respond to me here on time. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same?

Thank you.
27/09/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I would like to inform you that Ms. Vilsha had tried to call you multiple times at the scheduled time and the call was not picked up, I believe you must have missed the same and that is why the call did not happen. Now, on that note, I would like to personally present your care before her and see what can be done. Let me have a conversation with her and then I will let you know.
28/09/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 350 4042: Greetings Mr Singh. My phone does not have any record of any missed calls from Ms Vilsha. I suggest that we can still communicate through chats and or optionally audios, because we could be facing network challenges here and there. 
I also want to reiterate that if our discussion has to do with the issue of Abisai taking MLT, then we won't make any progress in that aspect.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Abisai!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, about that, I managed to have a discussion with Ms. Vilsha on your behalf, may I know by when can we connect with each other here for that?

19/10/23, 11:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Abisai, as we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 11:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/10/23, 12:13 am - +263 71 306 9115: Noted Ms Vilsha
20/10/23, 12:13 am - +263 71 306 9115: Noted Ms Vilsha
20/10/23, 12:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/10/23, 12:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
20/10/23, 12:35 am - +263 78 326 0958: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$250
5.$1000
20/10/23, 9:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details @263783260958. As you can see in your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
20/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 326 0958: It is true.Thank you very much Ms. Vilsha.
20/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
20/10/23, 7:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education at MVN University is $1,600.

In continuation of our discussion regarding your offer letter, as you can see in her offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments: the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means her total expenses for the first year amount to $1,600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1,850.

It's important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1,600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
21/10/23, 7:27 am - +263 78 326 0958: Yes Ms. Vilsha.
21/10/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 326 0958: I was willing to ask when will I be able to travel to India so that I can't miss much about my semester?
26/10/23, 3:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263783260958, the payment of the remaining fee can be paid through the same mode that you used earlier on to make the payment of your registration fee. If I am correct, I believe you made the payment through Mr. Shorwi's FBC bank account?
26/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 326 0958: OK.Thank you Ms. Vilsha
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263783260958. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well, the transfer charges are 11% of the amount you are due to pay. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
26/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 326 0958: Noted.
26/10/23, 3:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263783260958. With regard to the discussion we have had today, I would like to enquire about the date you have in mind to make the payment of your university registration fee so that we can communicate with the university officials and give them a head start to prepare your admission acceptance letter and your bonafide letter for the visa application process?
30/10/23, 3:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 3:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 3:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 350 4042: This is quite encouraging Vilsha, but we mustn't be kept guessing as to when Abisai should be flying to India. Rather, you should give us the update on when payments should be made, and the tentative dates for travelling to India upon meeting all visa, acceptance and travel requirements. It is difficult for us to be settled and feel comfortable, when there is apparently no timeline given for the above issues. I stand to be corrected.
30/10/23, 3:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263773504042, I completely understand your concerns, and that's why I was hoping to hear from you last week. Our aim is to ensure a smooth process for Abisai's admission to MVN University, which includes the timely payment of his registration fee. By getting an update from you on when you plan to make this payment, we can expedite the university's visa application process and Abisai's journey to India. The sooner these steps are completed, the sooner Abisai can join his peers, ensuring he's on track for his higher education goals. Our goal is to have Abisai here within the next few days (tentatively before the 15th of November) so he can seamlessly integrate into the academic environment.
30/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 350 4042: I trust a payment will be made before Friday this week. We are making arrangements, are along the way. It's only that we have to travel to the nearest banking hall from where we stay.
30/10/23, 5:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand @263773504042. If I may ask, may I know where do you reside in Zimbabwe? If you reside in Harare, the payment can be made through a more convenient mode than the FBC bank transfer? Alternatively, mukuru can be an option if you feel FBC banks are at a distance from where you reside.
30/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 350 4042: I'm in Gutu which is near the town of Masvingo. We were using Masvingo as our banking place. Mukuru is a very much better alternative way of making a payment.
30/10/23, 5:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @263773504042, in that case, if you feel making the payment through Mukuru would be easier, shall I share the account details for the same?
30/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 350 4042: Yes please
30/10/23, 5:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share the account details for the payment of your fee at a minimal charge and introduce you to the associate, Mr. Rajan. He has been helping students transfer their fees to India for a long time.

Once you make the payment of your fee, Mr. Rajan will issue a payment receipt to you, which will serve as proof of payment. Kindly share this receipt with us here in your admission group, so that we can notify the university officials accordingly. This will help ensure a smooth process for your admission.
30/10/23, 5:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The payment can be made either in cash or through Mukuru. Please note that in both cases, there will be an international transfer charge of 07% of the amount you wish to send.

If you are located in Harare and prefer to make the payment in cash, you can arrange to meet him at Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare.

Alternatively, if you are familiar with Mukuru, you can choose to make the payment through that platform. I will provide you with his contact details so that you can directly connect with him and coordinate the payment yourself.
30/10/23, 5:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Mukuru Account Details*

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare

National ID Number: 63 1037566X00

30/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 350 4042: Ok, will make an effort to make a payment tomorrow.
30/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 350 4042: So does it mean, 7% is additional to the 11% that is paid when making a bank deposit/ transfer? Please clarify.
30/10/23, 5:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, @263773504042. Given this confirmation, I will proceed to inform the university officials so they can prepare Abisai's acceptance and bonafide letters on their end. Once you complete the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will allow me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials.

In response to your query about transfer charges, since the required payment is $250, considering the 7% transfer charges, Mr. Rajan should receive $268. It's important to note that transfer charges can vary based on the method used. For Mr. Shorwi, it is 11% due to FBC bank charges. I hope this clears the query you had?

As soon as we receive this letter from the University Officials, we will promptly share it with you. Your understanding and patience during this time are greatly appreciated.

04/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 350 4042: I was checking with the completed document Mr Vilsha. I think Abisai did not complete the document correctly on section G. I think he filled information related to him, rather than that of me, his Father.
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263773504042 Thank you for sharing an update with us, For the better understanding could you please share the document with us?

04/11/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263773504042, I have gone through the shared document, you are absolutely correct. In the section G, He needs to fill your details, @263783260958 Kindly refill the details. I really appreciate your attention to details.
04/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 326 0958: Noted.
04/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 350 4042: Please assist on the same section that seems to be completed with father's details. Abisai is saying, before completion and during completion of the document, the section does not show that it relates to the information and details of the father of the applicant, rather it appears as if the information to be completed should be that of the applicant. 
I think that needs some kind of rectification. Also on another note, I would like to know whether it is possible for Abisai to meet the deadline for the date of arrival in India as ( *7 November 2023* ) as indicated in the Reference Details for MVN University, considering that today is 4 November 2023 and there are quite a number of things to be done?

06/11/23, 5:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, I would recommend starting a new application and filling in all the necessary details up to the document upload stage. Once you reach that point, kindly pause and wait for the Bonafide Letter to be provided to us. As soon as we receive it, we will promptly share it with you, allowing you to proceed with your application submission.

I am sure once you are in India, you will be able to celebrate this happy festival with us and experience all of these emotions.
