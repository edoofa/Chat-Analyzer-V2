Please find the important Off-Campus Accommodation Details, Booking, and Furnishing Information in the below PDF.

30/08/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 784 8367: Can you explain
31/08/23, 11:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prince,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you yesterday, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.
31/08/23, 11:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: We previously shared important information regarding off-campus accommodation arrangements, and we wanted to follow up to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.

Could you please let us know if you have been able to book your accommodation by now? If you haven't, have you been able to reach out to Ms. Eugene at her provided number?

Your response will help us ensure that all necessary arrangements for your arrival are in place, and hence we are looking to get a response before 01:00 PM. We are here to assist you every step of the way.
31/08/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 784 8367: I haven't booked my accomodation
31/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Okay @263777848367, I would like to understand the reason behind the delay in booking your accommodation. Have you encountered any difficulties or challenges in the process? Alternatively, have you had the opportunity to get in touch with Ms. Eugene for assistance? It's been three days since you received the instructions for your accommodation booking, and I'm curious to know if there's any specific reason for the delay.
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 784 8367: Can u please resend the procedure
31/08/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 784 8367: But this is off campus
31/08/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes. @263777848367, that is correct. If you intend to stay on campus, the payment for your first semester's accommodation fee shall be settled upon your arrival in India. 

It's essential to note that this payment should align with your arrival date. However, in the event that you decide to change your accommodation preference and opt for off-campus housing, it's important to be aware that securing off-campus accommodation on the day of your arrival may not be feasible. 

Availability is limited, and options might be quite limited due to the high demand. Please keep these considerations in mind as you make your decision regarding your accommodation arrangements.
31/08/23, 4:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Based on the updates provided by the university, it's been clarified that if a student intends to reside off campus, it is mandatory to pre-book their accommodation. This ensures a smooth transition into their housing upon arrival, eliminating any concerns about being without accommodations.
31/08/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 784 8367: I will arrive on the 7th of September so what will do
31/08/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777848367, as per our previous instructions, I hope you recall that you were not to book your flight for September 7th as the university has scheduled the arrival arrangements for September 6th. Additionally, there will be the G20 Summit taking place in Delhi, India, and this will result in high levels of security. 

Although we will still be able to assist and guide you with transportation from the airport to the university and help you settle into the accommodation you prebooked for yourself, it would be best if you could reschedule your flight to the 6th. This way, you will be traveling with other students, and we can provide you with the necessary assistance without any undue challenges. <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 784 8367: There is a big challenge to change my flight will cost me a lot of money
31/08/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern, Prince. It's unfortunate that situations like these arise. However, I want to assure you that we take extra measures to ensure our students are well-informed about instructions and arrival dates. Despite this, you booked your ticket without discussing it with us. If you are unable to reschedule your flight, you will have to be proactive and carefully follow all instructions.

05/09/23, 5:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings,

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation.

06/09/23, 8:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Prince,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 7th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
06/09/23, 8:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
06/09/23, 8:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Prince 2K22NOV1211*
