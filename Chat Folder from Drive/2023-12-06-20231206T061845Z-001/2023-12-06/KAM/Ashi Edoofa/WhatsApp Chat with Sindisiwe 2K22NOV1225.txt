31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sindisiwe!
I hope this message finds you well.

I am *Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer* at Edoofa. As we gear up for the 2023 intake, I have been diligently reviewing the applications of our prospective students. During this process, your admission file caught my attention, and I'd like to discuss a significant aspect with you.
31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I noticed that you were previously offered a remarkable opportunity by MVN University, presenting a generous 90% scholarship on your tuition fee. However, according to your application, it appears you decided to pursue your education at PDM University. This contrast in choices has prompted me to reach out to you, as I believe this decision holds more potential than meets the eye.

I am eager to explore this further and would like to know if now is a suitable time for us to connect and have a meaningful discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 9:42 pm - +27 78 189 6292: Good evening Sir. yes . now is a good time
31/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Good evening.As a parent I really appreciate your effort to help us but we are not puzzled by the pace at which preparations are going considering that the offer letters state August as the starting time.
31/08/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 285 5067: We are now
31/08/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, you do not have to worry about the pace at all, since we here will make sure that all the things for Sindisiwe's admission is completed in a timely manner and that we can make it true as soon as possible. Now, shall we move ahead with the discussion?
31/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Yes Sir
31/08/23, 9:54 pm - +27 78 189 6292: yes sir
31/08/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your willingness to engage in this discussion. Before we get into the details, I would appreciate it if you could share the thought process that led you to choose PDM University over MVN University, especially given the attractive 90% scholarship offered by MVN. This will help me understand your thought process better and then provide you with valuable feedback that can ensure you start your career right.
31/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 285 5067: We considered a number of options.the first is the rating of the university.Secondly we were informed that accomodation is shared by four in a room.3rd  we noticed that  there are no older Edofians. at MVN and we feared the environment may be very difficult for Sindisiwe to adjust
31/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Also other costs like for food
31/08/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 285 5067: That are charged separately
31/08/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I truly value your perspective, and it's clear that PDM University holds its merits as a preferred choice. I want to assure you that your choice of PDM is entirely valid and commendable.

However, I would also like to present an alternative viewpoint. Through recent conversations with the academic board and interactions with students, MVN University has surfaced as a university with exceptional potential. Its reputation for academic excellence, combined with its commitment to holistic student development, has garnered substantial recognition.
31/08/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: For a moment, I want you to Imagine an environment where modern infrastructure, well-equipped classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and ample sports facilities converge to create an optimal learning atmosphere. MVN University takes pride in fostering an all-encompassing educational journey and hence it seems to be a better fit for you and your family.

What sets MVN apart is its unwavering dedication to innovation and nurturing students' holistic growth. This focus positions MVN as a formidable contender against any institution. While PDM University undoubtedly has its merits, MVN's comprehensive approach offers a unique blend of academic prowess and personal development.
31/08/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, let's consider the financial aspect. Opting for MVN University would substantially lower your educational expenses. To put things in perspective, the annual costs at MVN are nearly half of what you would incur at PDM. This equates to obtaining a superior education, coupled with valuable cost savings, which could significantly impact your long-term financial outlook. I hope you are following? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 10:12 pm - +27 78 189 6292: following
31/08/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 285 5067: We asked for pics of the inside of the hostels but we didn't get them. We imagined 4 people from different cultures and background and maybe doing different degree programs with different work loads in one room.Honestly we thought it could be too much for our daughter to adjust to.
31/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 285 5067: So if am getting you well  MVN is more equiped than PDM?
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from, however, at that time the images were not available, but since they are now readily with us, let me share the same with you here.
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, that is very right, it is more equipped to provide better education to Sindisiwe, and along with that is also offering a better option for you to financially navigate your child's higher education journey. I hope you understand?
31/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 285 5067: So do the students choose whom to stay with in the hostels or not.
31/08/23, 10:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a valid concern regarding the hostel accommodations. I want to reassure you that MVN University takes students' comfort and cultural backgrounds into careful consideration. While the exact details might vary, the university typically ensures that students from similar backgrounds or communities are accommodated together whenever possible.

This approach is aimed at fostering a sense of belonging and making the adjustment process smoother for students. It creates a supportive environment where students can relate to each other's experiences and offer mutual support. Additionally, it helps in building a strong sense of community within the hostels. I hope this is clear?
31/08/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Yes I hear you. The other challenge is on food costs.The PDM hostel fees covers the food too. Considering that our daughter wants to study Law which is quite demanding in terms of work loads cooking may be demanding for her.
31/08/23, 10:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is not true at all. Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please. 

Hence, at just a small additional cost, Sindisiwe will get the food at MVN as well. Moreover, the total per annum costs at MVN with the food costs are still significantly lower than what it is at PDM. I hope you are clear?
31/08/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 285 5067: The hostel charges of 70_90$ end up bringing the cost to almost the same as those of PDM
31/08/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Sorry what is not true.Maybe we missed something
01/09/23, 5:53 am - +263 77 285 5067: Good day Mr Milan
01/09/23, 6:40 am - +263 77 285 5067: Yesterday you went offline before we conclude our discussion . Maybe I sounded like I don't appreciate your effort to help.its not that.i just wanted to have a clear picture of everything.May we conclude the matter.
01/09/23, 9:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sindisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/09/23, 9:34 am - +27 78 189 6292: Good morning sir. 
we are well and how are you?
01/09/23, 9:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, it was quite late in the night here and I had wrapped up for the day. I appreciate your patience and the concern that you showed to me here, let us move ahead with our discussion now.
01/09/23, 9:36 am - +27 78 189 6292: it's alright sir. we may continue with the discussion
01/09/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to this, I believe you have not correctly studied the offer letter from the side of the university, the accommodation charges are completely sponsored by the university please. Hence, you would not have to pay any accommodation fee, it would just be the food costs.
01/09/23, 9:46 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright so if we choose to settle for MVN it means we pay an extra of $70-$90 in addition to the tuition? For food I mean?
01/09/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 285 5067: Oh k.i understand now.
01/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, may I know if you have an other queries related to the same that you may wish to ask? <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 10:32 am - +27 78 189 6292: Yes sir. I would like to know if the students will still be allowed to stay in the hostels even during the Holidays if they don't manage to travel back to their homes
01/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. The hostels at the university remain open throughout the year, hence if a student is not travelling back to his/her home, they are free to stay at the campus please.
01/09/23, 10:34 am - +27 78 189 6292: will the food still be provided or they will have to cook for theirselves during the holidays?
01/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Both the options will be available for the students depending on the plan that they would have chosen for themselves please.
01/09/23, 10:35 am - +27 78 189 6292: Alright sir. thank you for making it clear
01/09/23, 10:37 am - +27 78 189 6292: no more queries
01/09/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, based on the discussion that we had, may I know what do you wish to finalize for Sindisiwe's higher education. Shall we go ahead to confirm at MVN University please?
01/09/23, 10:42 am - +27 78 189 6292: sorry sir for taking you back a bit. are there other Zimbabweans that are going to MVN for the year 2023?
01/09/23, 10:42 am - +27 78 189 6292: Yes you may Conclude MVN
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please dear. Now, let me share the same information with the university officials as well. 

Moving ahead, as you may recall that the admission fee for MVN University is $1000 and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
01/09/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. We have already completed the admission of a whole batch of Zimbabwean students at MVN University who are arriving this month.
01/09/23, 10:47 am - +27 78 189 6292: please give me a few minutes so I can connect with my mother. she is currently offline so I need to call her and inquire the same .
01/09/23, 10:47 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright sir. is it possible that you connect me with some of them
01/09/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure Sindisiwe, once we will complete the admission process, we will make sure to connect you with the whole batch of students who will be coming to MVN here in India.
01/09/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Please do that and then let me know of the same.
01/09/23, 10:49 am - +27 78 189 6292: Alright sir thank you
01/09/23, 10:49 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright
01/09/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Please try to give me an update as soon as possible so that we can plan the next steps accordingly.
01/09/23, 10:51 am - +27 78 189 6292: When is the latest date that we can pay it sir?
01/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: If you can manage to pay even today, it would be great since we will then move ahead to the VISA Processing by tomorrow.
01/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Otherwise, you can do that by tomorrow as well please.
01/09/23, 10:53 am - +27 78 189 6292: Okay sir . what is the payment plan so that we make plans of paying either today or tomorrow
01/09/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if you would be making the payment from Zimbabwe as you had done before?
01/09/23, 10:54 am - +27 78 189 6292: yes sir. from Zimbabwe. Harare to be specific
01/09/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, may I know if you would be using Mr. Charles's FBC Account to make the payment as you did earlier for your registration fee?
01/09/23, 10:57 am - +27 78 189 6292: it is possible right to send to his FBC account while I'm using a Standard Chartered account?
01/09/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 285 5067: Is there any other option
02/09/23, 5:34 am - +263 77 285 5067: Good morning Mr.Milan.
02/09/23, 8:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sindisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 8:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
02/09/23, 8:22 am - +27 78 189 6292: Good morning sir. we are well thank you. how are you?
02/09/23, 8:22 am - +27 78 189 6292: Noted with thanks. I will share the proof of payment once I am done

02/09/23, 10:51 am - +27 78 189 6292: this is the proof of payment sir
02/09/23, 11:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
02/09/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: However, I believe you have not included the 11% transfer charges while making the payment, because with the 11% transfer charges the total amount that you had to pay was $278. Hence, you are left with a balance of $28, is that clear?
02/09/23, 11:14 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright sir . thank you
02/09/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: @27781896292 May I know if you are clear with this as well?

02/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know by when will you be clearing the balance now?
02/09/23, 11:28 am - +27 78 189 6292: on Monday sir . it's a weekend so the banks have already closed
02/09/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are done with that please let me know.
02/09/23, 11:29 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright . I will
04/09/23, 7:49 am - +27 78 189 6292: Good day sir. If we want to clear the balance from South Africa how do we do it?
04/09/23, 7:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sindisiwe!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 7:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can clear the balance from South Africa as well, may I know if you would be able to use Mama Money for that please?

04/09/23, 7:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for letting me know of that, however, if you are wishing to make the payment from South Africa, the most feasible mode to do that would be using Mama Money, hence, can you please confirm if it would be possible for you to do that payment through that?
04/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 77 285 5067: Unfortunately the person to send doesn't seem to be aware of where to access that service inS.A
04/09/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I understand that, let me help you in knowing more about Mama Money. If we are planning to get the payment done through Mama Money, then in that case, we will create a Mama Money Order for you equal to the amount that you wish to pay and then you will just have to visit the Shop where Mama Money outlets are present and deposit the cash and it will be paid. It's that simple. Now, may I know if would be able to do the payment that way so that I can get the order created for you?
04/09/23, 8:03 am - +263 77 285 5067: May we know which shops in S.A has the service so I can confirm if the person to send can get there
04/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know where exactly do you live in SA?

04/09/23, 8:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, then to make the payment, you can go to any of the outlets listed below and make the payment in cash to the order number that we will generate for you. It will be made in Rands as well.
04/09/23, 8:09 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/09/23, 9:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Sindisiwe, the Mama Money order can only be created on the receiver's end dear, it does not work that way.
04/09/23, 9:06 am - +27 78 189 6292: alright

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Since you are arriving late in the night, once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am and hence you would have to stay inside the airport for your safety in the morning at 10:00, you will have to check out. In the morning, you can meet the Edoofa officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.

I hope that you are in good health and spirits

This is *Mr Rithvik*, _HOD_, of the _Division of Student Welfare_ at *Edoofa*
19/09/23, 12:10 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: I wanted to check in and inquire about your recent communication with your mentor. She mentioned that she attempted to schedule calls with you on multiple occasions, but it seems there was a lack of response from your end. Could you please share the reason for this so we can ensure you receive the support you need?
19/09/23, 12:13 pm - +27 78 189 6292: Good day sir. I was having problems with my Indian network and google account but it is all good now
19/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Good day Sir. Maybe you can also help us with another issue on payment of fees. Before Sindisiwe had come to India I had inquired about the payment conditions for the balance.
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: And may I ask something else please
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Sure @263772855067, Please go ahead with your query
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: I just want to confirm weather the privilege given to Edofians of paying the balance in fees in two installments is applicable to all universities.
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: I can understand your concern, kindly allow me sometime to confirm the same from the team.
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Yes please coz I have to be sure to avoid inconvenience s especially to the child when she gets there.
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: I can totally understand that @263772855067
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Good Morning Parents and Sindisiwe, 

I hope you are doing well, As I have discussed your concern with the team, They have informed me that your remaining balance for the first year's fees is $850 which needs to be clear before your arrival. May I know if the amount is clear to you?
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 285 5067: In relation to the outstanding first-year balance fee of $850, we'd like to remind you that this fee is divided into two installments of $425 each. The initial installment should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, and the second installment is due in the subsequent semester.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 285 5067: However when Sindisiwe was paying the fees that side she was told that the whole amount is wanted now. That being the case  Can we deposit the balance in Mr Charles Jerera s FBC account.
19/09/23, 12:37 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: Yes, This is correct
19/09/23, 12:37 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: As per now, Your fee status is clear
19/09/23, 12:37 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: I understand that
Please connect with your mentor now
19/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 285 5067: Thank you sir. Have a pleasant day.
