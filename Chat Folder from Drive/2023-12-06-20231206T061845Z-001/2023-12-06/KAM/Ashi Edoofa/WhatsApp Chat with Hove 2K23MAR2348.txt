I hope this message finds you well. We previously shared important information regarding off-campus accommodation arrangements, and we wanted to follow up to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.

Could you please let us know if you have been able to book your accommodation by now? If you haven't, have you been able to reach out to Ms. Eugene at her provided number?

Your response will help us ensure that all necessary arrangements for your arrival are in place, and hence we are looking to get a response before 01:00 PM. We are here to assist you every step of the way.
31/08/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 146 3912: Good day to you the we had said we prefer in campus
31/08/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 146 3912: Good day to you we had decided and agreed to take the incampus accomodation
31/08/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely Hove, that will be fine as well. If you intend to stay on campus, the payment for your first semester's accommodation fee shall be settled upon your arrival in India. 

It's essential to note that this payment should align with your arrival date. However, in the event that you decide to change your accommodation preference and opt for off-campus housing, it's important to be aware that securing off-campus accommodation on the day of your arrival may not be feasible. 

Availability is limited, and options might be quite limited due to the high demand. Please keep these considerations in mind as you make your decision regarding your accommodation arrangements.
31/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you've taken this into careful consideration, I recommend that we proceed with informing the university about your decision to stay on campus. Confirming your choice will allow the university to make the necessary arrangements in preparation for your arrival.

Kindly let me know your confirmation latest by today so that I can promptly convey this information to the university authorities.
31/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 652 2688: Good day,we are confirming that on campus accommodation is preferred  and
31/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 652 2688: We have set aside the amount mentioned prior
31/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I want to assure you that your efforts and communication have been duly noted and will be appropriately updated in our records. I'll also relay this information to the university officials, ensuring that everything is aligned for your smooth transition.
31/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we move forward, rest assured that we are here to support you every step of the way. Keep an eye out for the arrival guidelines we'll be sharing within this week. Meanwhile, focus on getting your bags packed and making sure you're all set for your upcoming journey.
31/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Should you have any queries, need further clarifications, or simply want to share updates, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your journey is important to us, and we're committed to making it a seamless and positive experience.
03/09/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Hove,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Hove 2K23MAR2348*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
