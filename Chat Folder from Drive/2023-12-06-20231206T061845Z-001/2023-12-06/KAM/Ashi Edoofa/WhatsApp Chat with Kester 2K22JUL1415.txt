06/09/23, 10:11 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kester, 

I hope you are doing well, I understand your concern about the bank statement for the visa application process. If you prefer, a friend or family member who can help you with the bank statement with a different sure name, in that case, he/she will also have to act as a sponsor and can help you with the visa application process.
06/09/23, 10:11 am - Ashi Edoofa: In this particular case, the letter of sponsorship should be issued by your sponsor. The format for the letter was shared with you earlier during our conversation. 

Your guardian can act as the sponsor for the visa application process and issue the letter of sponsorship. In the letter, he/she would have to clearly mention his/her relationship with you as your guardian. 

Additionally, the bank statement provided for the visa application should be that of your guardian, as they will be financially supporting your education.

To ensure a smooth and successful visa application, it is crucial to provide all necessary documentation, including a well-written sponsorship letter with all relevant details.

13/09/23, 7:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 03:00 pm. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Kester 2K22JUL1415*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $30 to $40 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
