14/08/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Good afternoon sir. Noted with thanks
14/08/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Nyasha!

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Along with Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

Before we proceed, I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today?
14/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 686 0848: We are ok
14/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Thank you
14/08/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you all doing fine. Since this is your admissions group, we would like your parents as well to be a part of this group so that they are familiar with the admission process and, when required, they can speak with us in the group accordingly. So, may I know if they are already added or not?
14/08/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Good evening Ms Kirti. Thank you so much I'm on board.  I'm Mitchell's father Mr Marerwa
14/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263772924145. It is a pleasure connecting with you today. Since it's the first time we are connected with each other, may I know your good name or how would you want me to address you?
14/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 292 4145: You can call me Mapfumo or Mr Marerwa.  Thank you
14/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that Mr. Marerwa. I would even like to inform you that this group wants equal participation of Parents if the student is unavailable, and it would be appreciated if you share your reasons for not connecting beforehand if you or the student is not available.

As the admission process discussion is likely to finish within 4 days, so please be attentive so we can carry the process smoothly without any delay. I hope we are clear on this?
14/08/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 292 4145: I have been in the group since its formation and the student has been available and most questions were hers to answer. I only responded when the parent was needed.
14/08/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 292 4145: If I don't respond in time it might be a challenge of network but mostly I will be online
14/08/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that.  First of all, I would like to congratulate you and your family on making the decision to enroll Nyasha in the Edoofa program.

Our goal here remains the same: *To ensure that every Edoofian is treated with the same respect and care, and now that you've been accepted into the scholarship program, I'd want to walk you through the steps you'll be taking*
14/08/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, I would like to share that our available hours are from *12.00 pm to 04:00 pm* and our discussions will be held from *07.30 pm to 11.00 pm* so make sure that you are available during our discussion hours so that, our discussion will be carried out within the same duration. I hope you have taken note of our discussion hours?
14/08/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Well noted . Thank you so much
14/08/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 292 4145: I'm glad that my  daughter has been accepted into the Edoofian scholarship and really appreciate.
14/08/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know that you have taken note of our available and discussion hours. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Kunal, and he/she did brief me about Nyasha's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
14/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Thank you and in a nutshell I can say the Councillor was educative and he spoke about the student working while learning. This point caught my eye because it will help us pay the balance fees from the scholarship. He also mentioned that our fees difference will be about 2000 to 3000 per annum
14/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience! I have known Mr. Kunal for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
14/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
14/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Nyasha 2K23AUG0735)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
14/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Nyasha EWYL23E0540)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
14/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 292 4145: I got it, thank you
14/08/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two Whatsapp groups. Moving forward, I am sharing a feedback form with you, I would like you to please take some time and fill out the same with your honest opinion, as it will help us and the entire team at Edoofa to work better and help the students with utmost care and importance.
14/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly print the above form and then fill it in since it has to be handwritten, and please attach a passport-sized photo of yours in the space provided on the form. 
After filling in the form, you can scan the form or click a photo from your phone and share it with us here in your admission group.
14/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, kindly fill out the Edoofa Student Application Form, which will be used to fill out your application that will be sent to the universities. 

Just so you know, when you fill out the form, you will have to fill in the name of your admission group, please note that it will be the name of this group.

https://forms.gle/wC25STL9ebhovLzg8

After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded, please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
16/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
16/08/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes they are clear. Thank you
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/08/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 686 0848: I'm following
16/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes ma'am it's clear
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/08/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes we can
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
16/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 686 0848: I think I will be done by 3
16/08/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response. Please do let me know once you are done going through the videos.
16/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 686 0848: The first video about a successful journey with Edoofa. The founders encouraged us to follow instructions and also to be teachable and open minded. Mr Vivek and Mr Angad went on to say in the second video that Edoofas vision is to make education affordable and increase student's capacity for success. They went on to encourage us on the third video that it is connected to a lot of prestigious universities and colleges so as students we should be teachable to be able to access those institutions. Mr Angad explained the importance of the SOP and every study must fill in the form.


Thank you
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes
16/08/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
16/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 686 0848: I am following
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
16/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Content: Rights are the privileges given to a citizen which are protected by the constitution but duties are something you are required to do for moral or legal reasons. Rights are what you are constitutionally entitled to while duties are what you are to do concerning the rights.

One should know that rights comes with responsibility. Let's take for example if one has the right to freedom, he or she has a responsibility to live as a responsible citizen. If you break the law you are certainly punished for it. You cannot go around claiming that your rights have been abused yet you fail to take the responsibilities that come with them. The right of a citizen can be defended or challenged by the law but the duties cannot be.
16/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 686 0848: 5. A good lawyer must have good communication skills
Lawyers must be orally articulate, have good written communication skills and also be good listeners. In order to argue convincingly in the courtroom before juries and judges, good public speaking skills are essential. Communication and speaking skills can be developed during your studies by taking part in activities such as mooting or general public speaking.

Lawyers must also be able to write clearly, persuasively and concisely, as they must produce a variety of legal documents.


I am someone who is confident and can do everything with out hesitating. I have good communication skills which I think makes me a good lawyer.
16/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 686 0848: One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain their client's innocence.
Both of them are lawyers but one works for the government agency and the other works solo or for a law firm. A prosecutor is an attorney employed by the Government and prosecutes people accused of breaking the law. Prosecutors work with police and other investigators to collect evidence, interview witnesses, and present their findings to a grand jury or judge. Lawyers are professionals that help people resolve legal disputes through legal action. A prosecutor’s job is more direct – they take on cases of accused criminals and try them in court.
16/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 686 0848: 4 a. Criminal law
b. A career in criminal justice is a great way to give back to your community. The field is full of jobs that help others; from law enforcement to working in the court system, you're protecting people from criminal activity, helping crime victims and ensuring justice for them and society.

16/08/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and the academic documents. May I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form and share your identity proof?

16/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2023 intake?
16/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes
16/08/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now before we move forward. However, I got to know from your counselor that due to time constraints, you may even consider the intake in August 2024, so I would appreciate it if you could provide me with clarity so that I can let you know which is the right decision to make and proceed with the admission process?
16/08/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 686 0848: My intention is to start college in 2023
16/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, the update I received from your counselor was that you have a concern regarding the time constraints, so let me help you understand, that the entire admission process to complete will take 10 days if you are financially prepared and you can definitely arrive in India by August 2023. 

So I would like to have a confirmation from your side, that you are mentally and financially prepared for your admission fee and travel expenses from Zimbabwe to India if you want an August 2023 intake?
16/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 686 0848: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 686 0848: My father was promised a loan on the basis of the University or college offer letter so yes
16/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 686 0848: My apologies for the late response. My network is slow
16/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, thank you for the confirmation.
16/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes I am ready
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes
16/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes he did
16/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes it is
16/08/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes I am following.
16/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 686 0848: No not yet ma'am
16/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Hi Kirti. Sorry I have a question. We paid 350 earlier on for registration and we were told it will be deducted on tuition . May you please clarify as I didn't see it on your calculations
16/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, which you have already paid, and the $750 registration fee which is mentioned here is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
16/08/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 292 4145: It's clear thank you
16/08/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.  Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well.  Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey.


Now, Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions officer at Edoofa will connect with you Tomorrow at 9:30 AM to understand your and your family’s thoughts on your next steps and guide you on how you can begin with your university admission process. Along with that, he will also be helping you to start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

Please share a brief introduction of you and your parents before starting the discussion tomorrow and make sure your parents are active as well.
16/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Noted with thanks
16/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night.
16/08/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Same to you
16/08/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
17/08/23, 9:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents, and Nyasha!
I hope I find you well. ☀️

I am Mr. Milan and I am the Senior Admissions Officer here at Edoofa. It has been brought to my attention that Ms. Kirti has had a discussion with Nyasha about the next steps in the admission process, and I assume that Nyasha has also shared the details of the conversation with you at home.

Before we proceed with your admission journey, I would like to kindly ask if you have any questions or concerns that you would like to discuss with me. I am here to assist you throughout the process, so please feel free to share any thoughts or queries you may have.
17/08/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 686 0848: Good morning Mr Milan. Thank you. I have no questions yet
17/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 292 4145: Good morning Mr Milan . I'm Mr Marerwa , Nyashas father. I'm glad to learn that you are going to take us through this journey and hope it will be a successful one.  Thank you
17/08/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to connect with you here Mr. Marerwa and Nyasha. And I am very happy to see that you have understood the admission process well and do not have any queries as such. Now before we move ahead with our conversation, let me first help you in starting with Nyasha's EWYL Program here.
17/08/23, 10:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India. 

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Nyasha EWYL23E0540*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link. 

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GtvOQ3WWYMUE6G5oqKhZVj
17/08/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - 

*Dear Mentor, my name is Mitchell Nyasha Marerwa and my EWYL group name is Nyasha EWYL23E0540. I am now ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.*
17/08/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message - 

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __
17/08/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 686 0848: Noted with action Sir. Thank you
17/08/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Mr. Marerwa, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
17/08/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 292 4145: Yes we may go ahead
17/08/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process (enroll yourself at the university) and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
17/08/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship.

The universities usually take a few days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned.
17/08/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is actually a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
17/08/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 686 0848: Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. Tenzin
17/08/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 292 4145: Yes we are on the same page and you can go ahead.  I'm prepared
17/08/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me here dear.
17/08/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
17/08/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
17/08/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
17/08/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 292 4145: Clear thank you
17/08/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware that your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you would be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750.
17/08/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 01st March 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 15th March 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?
	
*Note: The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further*
17/08/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 292 4145: Well understood
17/08/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, since all the students have received their results and are eager to complete their university admission process, If you as parents are prepared to proceed with your child’s admission process, we would share your application with the universities this week so that you can get the scholarship offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, the registration fee due will be $750 and you would have to pay it as per the deadline of 30th August.
17/08/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 292 4145: Noted with thanks
17/08/23, 10:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, if you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadline, shall we go ahead with Nyasha's university application process and share his application with the universities recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?

Alternatively, if you need time to discuss the same and then move ahead, you can do that as well, please.
17/08/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 292 4145: Please go ahead.
17/08/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Now as you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Nyasha's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you would be able to manage the registration fee in due time (by 30th August ) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
17/08/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 292 4145: Yes I'm confident and may go ahead to the step
17/08/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Nyasha's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Nyasha's higher education well.
17/08/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 292 4145: I have no questions at the moment
17/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 292 4145: Thank you so much and hope she will be admitted on the recent next semester
17/08/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! Yes, please we will make sure that Nyasha joins the other Edoofians here in India in the coming month.
17/08/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 292 4145: Thank you
18/08/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 292 4145: That's OK but I think I still have it
18/08/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please let me share it here again for reference:

18/08/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 292 4145: No questions

18/08/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed they are! Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better.

21/08/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/08/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to discuss about the offer letter from MVN University with your family yet?
21/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Good afternoon sir. Yes we discussed about the offer letter with my family and they think its a good opportunity for me
21/08/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. How did the discussion go? What were their thoughts on the offer letter?

21/08/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have such thoughts and this ensures that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
21/08/23, 7:13 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Yes I would like to ask something. The 100% mentioned that is for accommodation only. So what about the food
22/08/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/08/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Nyasha, Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
22/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 292 4145: If students wants to cook for themselves are they any other utensils which they are provided.  E.g stoves
22/08/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the self-cooking preference, since the students will be doing that on a personal front, therefore, the cooking utensils are not provided, the students would have to collectively arrange them.
22/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Will they be allowed to cook in their respective rooms or they is a public kitchen
22/08/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: They can cook in their respective rooms as well please.
22/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Thank you so much
22/08/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?
22/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 292 4145: No further questions.  Thank you
22/08/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.

24/08/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 686 0848: Good morning sir. I have to come prepared. On accommodation does it include bed and blankets or its just an empty room. And on stationery what should I prepare

24/08/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Nyasha, when it comes to the preparations that you need to do before arrival, I would like to mention that you do not need to arrange any of the things that you have mentioned here since you can buy them after arriving here in India please. I hope you are clear with that.
24/08/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 686 0848: Yes I understand.
24/08/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, that is good to know. Moving ahead, can you please also let me know by when are you planning to make the payment of the admission fee as well so that we can complete your admission and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
24/08/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 686 0848: However I wanted to know what is needed in order for me to plan my budget
24/08/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 686 0848: Hopefully by tomorrow
24/08/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know Nyasha. Now, once you are done with the payment of your admission fee by tomorrow, please let me know of that by sharing the receipt of the payment here so that I can inform the university officials fo the same as well.
24/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 292 4145: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 292 4145: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 292 4145: Good afternoon
24/08/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
24/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 292 4145: It's fine thank you. It was a cash deposit
24/08/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, it is well noted with us.
25/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Noted
25/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 686 0848: So when will the semester start
25/08/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Nyasha, the semesters have already started at some of the universities, however, the students can still arrive till the month of October and start with their studies.
25/08/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
25/08/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

25/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 686 0848: Noted
25/08/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us discuss the offer letter from Galgotias as well. Now, In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
25/08/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 686 0848: 1.900
2.5years
3.300
4.750
25/08/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree.

01/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 686 0848: On the requirements on number 8 it is written that a bank statement of the sponsor is needed. So I wanted to know if Edoofa is considered as the sponsor or my parents
01/09/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern about the bank statement for the visa application process. In that case, if you have the required funds with you, you can deposit the money into your account with your surname, obtain the bank statement for the application procedures, and later withdraw the money if needed. 

Alternatively, if you prefer, a friend or family member who can help you with the bank statement with a different sure name, in that case, he/she will also have to act as a sponsor and can help you with the visa application process.
01/09/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this particular case, the letter of sponsorship should be issued by your sponsor. The format for the letter was shared with you earlier during our conversation. 

Your guardian can act as the sponsor for the visa application process and issue the letter of sponsorship. In the letter, he/she would have to clearly mention his/her relationship with you as your guardian. 

Additionally, the bank statement provided for the visa application should be that of your guardian, as they will be financially supporting your education.

To ensure a smooth and successful visa application, it is crucial to provide all necessary documentation, including a well-written sponsorship letter with all relevant details.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Nyasha 2K23AUG0735*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
09/09/23, 10:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
