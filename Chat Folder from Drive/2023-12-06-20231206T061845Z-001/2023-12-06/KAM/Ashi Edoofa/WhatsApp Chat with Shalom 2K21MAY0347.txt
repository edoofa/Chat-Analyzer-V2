03/08/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for informing me about your decision. I am curious to understand the reasons behind your inclination towards PDM despite MVN offering a higher quantum of scholarship and 100% coverage for accommodation expenses. Could you kindly shed some light on your considerations for choosing PDM over MVN in this matter? Your insights will be greatly appreciated.
03/08/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 686 7482: MVN is indeed a good choice but due to the financial preparations we aren't flexible to make the top up due to other processes ahead such as ticket booking, Visa application.....

31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Shalom!
I hope this message finds you well.

I am *Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer* at Edoofa. As we gear up for the 2023 intake, I have been diligently reviewing the applications of our prospective students. During this process, your admission file caught my attention, and I'd like to discuss a significant aspect with you.
31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I noticed that you were previously offered a remarkable opportunity by MVN University, presenting a generous 90% scholarship on your tuition fee. However, according to your application, it appears you decided to pursue your education at PDM University. This contrast in choices has prompted me to reach out to you, as I believe this decision holds more potential than meets the eye.

I am eager to explore this further and would like to know if now is a suitable time for us to connect and have a meaningful discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion? <This message was edited>
02/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 686 7482: Greetings sir
02/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 686 7482: It's a pleasure connecting with you
02/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 686 7482: We can have the discussion today at 9pm Zim time
04/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
04/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, May I know if we can move ahead to have a discussion regarding the further steps please?
04/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 686 7482: Greetings sir
04/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 686 7482: We are fine thank you and you?
04/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, thank you for your willingness to engage in this discussion. Before we get into the details, I would appreciate it if you could share the thought process that led you to choose PDM University over MVN University, especially given the attractive 90% scholarship offered by MVN. This will help me understand your thought process better and then provide you with valuable feedback that can ensure you start your career right.
04/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 686 7482: Yes we can
04/09/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Shalom, before we move ahead, please do this dear.
04/09/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 686 7482: I had to stick to PDM University due to the fact that at the moment my parents are busy with the preparations (flight ticket and visa) so they can't manage to make the top up for me to transfer to MVN but if it was possible that they could make the payment in 2 months then I would take the offer sir and the scholarship percentage is very good
04/09/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I truly value your perspective, and it's clear that PDM University holds its merits as a preferred choice. I want to assure you that your choice of PDM is entirely valid and commendable.

However, I would also like to present an alternative viewpoint. Through recent conversations with the academic board and interactions with students, MVN University has surfaced as a university with exceptional potential. Its reputation for academic excellence, combined with its commitment to holistic student development, has garnered substantial recognition.
04/09/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: For a moment, I want you to Imagine an environment where modern infrastructure, well-equipped classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and ample sports facilities converge to create an optimal learning atmosphere. MVN University takes pride in fostering an all-encompassing educational journey and hence it seems to be a better fit for you and your family.

What sets MVN apart is its unwavering dedication to innovation and nurturing students' holistic growth. This focus positions MVN as a formidable contender against any institution. While PDM University undoubtedly has its merits, MVN's comprehensive approach offers a unique blend of academic prowess and personal development.
04/09/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, let's consider the financial aspect. Opting for MVN University would substantially lower your educational expenses. To put things in perspective, the annual costs at MVN are nearly half of what you would incur at PDM. This equates to obtaining a superior education, coupled with valuable cost savings, which could significantly impact your long-term financial outlook. I hope you are following?
04/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Yes sir am following
05/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: In essence, PDM is undoubtedly a strong choice, and MVN's merits simply provide an additional dimension to consider. We understand that every student's journey is unique, and our intention is to present you with a holistic perspective so you can make an informed decision that resonates with your aspirations.

Hence, the academic board has asked you to reconsider your university choice and give it a through thought before you commence your visa application process.
05/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 686 7482: Good morning sir
05/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 686 7482: We all well thanks and you?
05/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 686 7482: Noted with thanks sir
05/09/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, can you please let me know what have you finalized to do regarding your higher education. Do you wish to finalize your admission at MVN University please?
05/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 273 2588: Good afternoon sir
05/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 273 2588: I am the father to Shalom. Yes MVN has the best offer to my daughter and lessens the educational expenses to us. My challenge is I do not have the $250 top up as of now. I am devoted in rising the money for airticket and visa. If I can be given a grace period to pay we can generously take the offer
05/09/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, by when do you think you would be able to pay the balance amount of $250 please?
05/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 273 2588: By 30 November 2023
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier, since I was occupied in coordinating the arrival of the recent batch of Edoofians who came to India yesterday. I appreciate your patience here. Let me share a glimpse from the airport with you here as well.
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, can you please help me in understanding about why is it that you wish to do that by November end please?
07/09/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 273 2588: Good evening. Currently I am rising Shalom's airticket fee, visa fee as well as her pocket money and other expenses for her general up keep at school. Therefore the $250 came as emergency to us we had not  budgeted for it. This is the reason why we want time to pay.
08/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/09/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 273 2588: Good morning sir. We are fine
08/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that it would be better if you complete the balance admission fee first, and then plan to raise the finances for Airfare further so that we would be able to secure Shalom's seat at the university first. I hope you understand that?
11/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 273 2588: Good afternoon. I got your point and its a good idea. I recall the offer was for 15 days from the date of offer. Is it still available. Would it be possible for her to come to India this academic year or it will be a next year thing since universities opened already
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shalom!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes please, since we had a discussion with the university officials, the offer still stands for you to take. Moreover, when it comes to the admission fee, since you had already paid $750 for Shalom's admission at PDM University, that amount will be adjusted towards her admission fee at MVN as well. 

This means that you would only have to pay the difference, i.e. $250 in order to secure the admission at MVN. Is that clear?
12/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 686 7482: Greetings sir
12/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, can you please also let me know by when will you be able to clear the balance fee so that we can confirm Shalom's admission at MVN University? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 273 2588: By 30/09/2023
12/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know, however, considering the urgency of the admissions for this year, I would highly advise you to make the payment as soon as possible to make sure that the admission is completed in a timely manner and that we can move ahead to the VISA and Travel preparations as well.
12/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 273 2588: Noted we will try are best
12/09/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, once you finalize an earlier date to make the payment, please let me know of that.
12/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 273 2588: Its fine. Thank you
12/09/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome.

10/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 686 7482: The booking was done by an agent and I was expecting to receive the departure date as the 11th of October but today he sent me 14 of October as the departure date l was surprised because they had agreed on the day

10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @263786867482, in that case kindly contact your travel agent who has booked your ticket and ask them to reschedule your ticket for the next arrival date of 18th of October as he has booked your ticket without confirming the date from your side.

08/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 273 2588: Good morning Mr Mukund. Let me start by appreciating the good work your organisation and staff have been doing since my daughter started the application, enrolment upto landing in India. You have been courteously and kindly assisting us in this journey. You were keeping us well informed inadvance of the goings on so that we could plan accordingly. There was an effective communication between us and your organisation in general. I am surprised to just receive the message saying my child will face suspension from lessons if I fail to pay the fees by the end of the week. Why did not you give me a notice in advance of the due date for payment of the fees so that I could plan accordingly before the due date. I think the message is a little bit too harsh. I have been processing and preparing her journey to that side little did I know that her fees were already due before her coming there. Anywhere I am running around but I can not get all the amount due visa viz your due date. May you please assist while I am  looking for the money. For planning purposes would you mind to send me the due dates for fees payment per semestar. I am also not understanding the enrollment fee of $63 may you shade light on that one. My understanding I cleared all the moneys to do with the first stages
08/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 273 2588: Thank you for your cooperation sir
08/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 273 2588: Im Shalom Chibondo's father. Im sorry for the late response I have been travelling and network was a problem
08/11/23, 10:56 am - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

We wanted to clarify that fee reminders were initially shared in the group and also conveyed directly to Shalom. We understand that there may have been constraints in acknowledging these reminders.

Regarding the fee payment, we kindly request that you make a substantial payment by the weekend, and the remaining amount by the 15th of November. We do acknowledge that there has been a delay, and we appreciate your cooperation in settling the outstanding fee.

Additionally, the $63 charge pertains to the pending enrollment fee for Edoofa, which Shalom were left to be paid out of the $350

Thank you for your understanding, and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Warm regards,
08/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 273 2588: Ok
08/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 273 2588: After paying the amount due what is going to be the balance and when is it supposed to be paid
08/11/23, 11:44 am - +91 93546 23922: the balance will depend on what amount you pay now also the deadline for the remaining would be till 15th November

22/11/23, 12:13 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance regarding your child's academic standing at the college.

Despite several reminders and extensive conversations, it has come to our attention that the outstanding fees of *$425* have not been settled. We have made diligent efforts to work with you, engaging in negotiations with the university on your behalf. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution, and the outstanding payment remains unresolved.

As a result of the persistent non-payment, the college has taken the difficult decision to block your child's access to classes. This means that, effective immediately, your child will be unable to attend any classes until the outstanding fees are settled.

We understand that financial matters can be challenging, and we have been committed to finding an amicable solution. However, the prolonged non-payment has left us with no alternative but to take this measure.

We urge you to address this matter urgently to ensure your child's uninterrupted academic progress. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We believe that together we can resolve this issue and continue to support your child's educational journey.
