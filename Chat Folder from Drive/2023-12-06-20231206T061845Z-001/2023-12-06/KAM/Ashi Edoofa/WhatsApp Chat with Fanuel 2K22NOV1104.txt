So given the limited time between now and the departure day which is the 5th of September are we going to be to complete the Visa application process. As it stands now we cannot submit the online visa application forms because we do not have all the necessary documents from the university. 
On the contrary  we are  also losing an opportunity to purchase an affordable Air ticket as they can only accept our payment upon presentation of the visa, thus we risk losing the reservation as the travel Agent has indicated that seats are filling up fast.

09/09/23, 10:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Fanuel,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
09/09/23, 10:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
09/09/23, 10:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Fanuel 2K22NOV1104*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.

10/09/23, 10:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Fanuel

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotias University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester. <This message was edited>
10/09/23, 10:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Fanuel Anotidaishe Chaleka
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding semester-year balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, 

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 10:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you want to bring your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
10/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 825 1324: Greetings  Ms Ashi  , yes the fee breakdown is accurate and we will pay upon arrival in cash.
Thank you
11/09/23, 12:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We previously shared important information regarding off-campus accommodation arrangements, and we wanted to follow up to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.

Could you please let us know if you have been able to book your accommodation by now? If you haven't, have you been able to reach out to Ms. Eugene at her provided number?

Your response will help us ensure that all necessary arrangements for your arrival are in place, and hence we are looking to get a response before 02:00 PM. We are here to assist you every step of the way. <This message was edited>
