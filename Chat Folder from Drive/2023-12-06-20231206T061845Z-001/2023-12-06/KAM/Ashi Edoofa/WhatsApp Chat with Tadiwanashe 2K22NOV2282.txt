31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
31/08/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Hello sir ....Thank you for the update. We were really looking forward to it. We truly appreciate. Well , as of the discussion we can  schedule it to commence at anytime after 8.30AM tomorrow. Thank you once again

01/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: As per the schedule that we had set for our conversation today, shall we move ahead to start with the discussion now?
01/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning sir .... I think we ready to move on with the discussion
01/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Commerce.
01/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
01/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 679 0424: I think its the best idea to do some courses that bring bring down annual expenses and I'm willing to explore
01/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are ready to know more about the opportunity. Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course B.Com. for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
01/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 679 0424: That will be okay .... and I think I understood everything
01/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 556 6987: How are you we are just seeking clarification..pertaining the issue..because we were offered to choose  between PDM anLPV universities  and we had opted for PDM when you enquired  from us so MVN is new university to us  maybe you can elaborate
01/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 556 6987: But we have no problem at all in allowing our nephew  to study  at your university which proves to be one of the best
01/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 556 6987: [26/06, 09:53] +91 83840 48513: Good Morning, dear Parents and Tadiwanashe

I would like to share an update with you, we shared your application with one of the best universities in India, which is Lovely Professional University (LPU).

I hope this message reaches you in good health and prosperity. I apologize for my inability to connect with you yesterday as I was occupied with a meeting. May I know if you are available for a session regarding the discussion of the offer letter?

01/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 556 6987: The above is the communication we did regardingPDM university  with Admission  officer  Shivjeet
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please now, regarding that, Tadiwanashe's application was reconsidered as a part of a whole batch of students who were shortlisted for the opportunity that the academic board is offering here in which they get the chance to study a much better course that can lead them to have a better career with the costs being cut down to a huge margin to ensure that they can be comfortable with the finances of their higher education as well. Is that clear now?
02/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 556 6987: Yes it is clear thank you
02/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 556 6987: Good afternoon to you too
02/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 556 6987: Thank you for the clarification
04/09/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, shall we move ahead to finalize Tadiwanashe's admission at MVN University for the course B.Com.?
04/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 556 6987: Yes we can
04/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 556 6987: Good morning
04/09/23, 12:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that, let me share the same information with the university officials and move ahead with the admission process.
04/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Good afternoon sir 
 Sorry sir for taking you back. Just wanted a clear clarification on B.com because from my research it is branched in many different types and I wanted to know which course am I going to do under B.com.
04/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 679 0424: And also I wanted to know if it is linked to Geography because I'm scared of starting something new that I don't know whether it'll be difficult for me or not
08/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 679 0424: Hello sir 
 First and foremost i wanted to say I'm deeply sorry for the burden I caused. I think im coming out to regret on bailing on LPU University so i was kindly asking, i know you are always busy but im kindly asking if it is still possible to try and reconnect with LPU university since they once accepted my application. I'm personally willing to face any consequences so as to make up for my mistakes and try to catch up with others. I'm sincerely asking for your help, if you can please help me out.
08/09/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/09/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, Tadiwanashe, can you please first let me know why is that you wish to go to LPU now dear?
08/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Firstly I just wanted to thank you sir for taking into consideration my appeal. I honestly appreciate. As for the question about LPU, lately I've been making my own researches about the best univerties in India and I came across LPU of which I had bailed on. It was in favourable rank and for a moment I regretted on the decision I had made. It took me days to swallow my pride and come clean to you with an apology. I even noticed some of the people who did my dream program who were very successful in future and I just wish to follow their footsteps. Ad another thing I noticed is students from LPU are not just the best in india but ranked in all over the world
08/09/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please I understand that, in that case, can you please also let me know why is it that you had denied going to LPU earlier?
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 679 0424: We were not yet financially ready and the one we had was enough for me to go to PDM and I didn't know a lot about LPU to convince me to go there. Another thing is I was pressurised by some of my older friends who learn there who told me good things about the school and I thought that was the only better school
08/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if you have finalized that you will be going to LPU for your higher education?
08/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Firstly,  may you please resend the statement that shows the fees that are needed to be paid.
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanshe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, all the costs that will be required for you at LPU are mentioned in your respective offer letter dear, may I know if you were able to go through that?
09/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Good evening sir 
To avoid confusion and all that, we came to a conclusion of choosing MVN university which is probably having students who are leaving soon and I think I'll do the B.Com degree program.
11/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>

11/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Good afternoon sir ... thank you for the offer letter but we were kindly askingfor guidance in terms of the registration fee since we received a new offer letter. So far we had made the payments I've posted above.
11/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, stay assured that I will help you with that moving ahead during our discussion. For that, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
11/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Yes sir we were able to go through the offer letter and we kind of understood everything but I think we might need a clear clarification on the fees that are paid after the 100% scholarship
11/09/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, sure. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail. Now, regarding your queries, I would be addressing them moving ahead as well. Before we proceed, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
11/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 679 0424: 1. My per annum fee after scholarship is $0
2. After sponsorship, my accommodation fee will be $0
3.My annual fee at MVN university after scholarship will be $1250
4.My sports and Misc fee will be $250
5.The admission and processing fee will be $575
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
12/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Yes I think I'm clear on this part
12/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
12/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 679 0424: I think I'm clear
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 679 0424: It is very clear sir
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
12/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Yes this is very interesting, I'm personally willing do the EWYL Programs
12/09/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
12/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 679 0424: I'm clear sir
12/09/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
12/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Since im not the one paying, as of right now I don't know but I'm sure it'll be paid as soon as possible
12/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, I would like you to have a discussion with your parents on that and then let me know.
13/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning sir ... 
As for the payment, it has been confirmed that it'll be done tomorrow
13/09/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, thank you for sharing the update with me here, it is well noted with us.
14/09/23, 8:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/09/23, 8:59 am - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had earlier, regarding the payment of your balance admission fee, you were to do that by today, hence can you please share na update on that with me here.
14/09/23, 9:01 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning sir ... 
The payment is going to be done today as soon as possible
14/09/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'll share the update after the payment

14/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 679 0424: The payment has been done sir
14/09/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
14/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 679 0424: Sure thing ... thank you sir

20/09/23, 12:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents, and Tadiwanashe,

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I am Ms. Vilsha, the head of admissions at Edoofa. 

Unfortunately, Ms.  Ashi, who has been assisting you with the visa procedures, is currently under the weather and hence, unable to communicate with you at the moment. Nevertheless, I on behalf of her will be in touch with you for the procedures till Ms. Ashi feels better.
20/09/23, 12:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding your recent communication with her, it appears that you have been in the process of gathering visa requirements and have received all the necessary documents from the university to initiate your visa application. 

Therefore, I wanted to inquire if you have already completed the visa application form at this point, or if you would like us to provide assistance with the same?
20/09/23, 6:32 am - +263 71 679 0424: Hello Ms. Vilsha . It is nice knowing you
20/09/23, 6:33 am - +263 71 679 0424: <Media omitted>

20/09/23, 6:55 am - +263 71 679 0424: And Ms. Vilsha, sorry for taking you back .... I wanted to ask about somwthing. From the admission acceptance letter, it said the arrival date on the itinerary ticket has to be the 26th of September,  but our dummy ticket is showing  the arrival date of 23 September. Will it cause any problems or we can still use it like that for the visa application.
20/09/23, 12:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263716790424, the itinerary ticket and the actual ticket are two different things, and hence it is fine if you have an itinerary with the date of 23rd September. 

However, after you secure your visa, you are supposed to book your flight ticket for the arrival dates of 26th September or 4th October and pay for the same accordingly. This will ensure that your actual travel plans align with the required arrival date for your program.
20/09/23, 12:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, since it's time to move forward to the next step of your journey, which is the Online Visa Application.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 10th of Oct at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
08/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tadiwanashe 2K22NOV2282*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5.  Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
08/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport.
