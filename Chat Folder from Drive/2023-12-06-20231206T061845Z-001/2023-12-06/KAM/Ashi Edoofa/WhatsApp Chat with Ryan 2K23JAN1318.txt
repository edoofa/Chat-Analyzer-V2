29/08/23, 10:01 am - +91 93546 23922: i totally do, we will connect with you very soon
29/08/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 561 0490: Okay sure
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good afternoon Ryan, if you want to go for on campus accommodation then you will be guided accordingly on your arrival.
29/08/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 561 0490: Is it possible to still secure for the off campus accommodation so that l will be able to choose when l arrive there
31/08/23, 11:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: We previously shared important information regarding off-campus accommodation arrangements, and we wanted to follow up to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.

Could you please let us know if you have been able to book your accommodation by now? If you haven't, have you been able to reach out to Ms. Eugene at her provided number?

Your response will help us ensure that all necessary arrangements for your arrival are in place, and hence we are looking to get a response before 01:00 PM. We are here to assist you every step of the way.
31/08/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 561 0490: Good afternoon, l did not yet contacted Ms Eugene
31/08/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 561 0490: I was  saying ,is it possible for me to choose  what's best for me when l arrive there
31/08/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you are considering off-campus accommodation, keep in mind that you'll need to prebook your lodging before you can board your flight to India. Many students are currently reserving their rooms, and by the time you arrive, there's a significant chance that securing an apartment on the same day might not be possible.

To ensure you find the place you're looking for, it's essential to book your flight ticket early. With spaces filling up rapidly, making an early reservation increases your chances of getting the exact spot you desire.
31/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 561 0490: What do you mean here
31/08/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 561 0490: OK am saying suppose l secure my off campus accommodation and then when l arrive there  l will have the pleasure to choose in between the off campus and the on campus
31/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 931 4288: Good afternoon dear admission team ,allow me to make it more clearer of what Ryan is trying to say.
If possible we can pay to secure for the off campus housing so that on his arrival he has the opportunity and autonomy to choose between the two, in case he might not like the off campus , looking forward for your response on this
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 931 4288: One last important thing is ,we would like to know the total fee of the accommodation for the two options .
31/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Based on the updates provided by the university, it's been clarified that if a student intends to reside off campus, it is mandatory to pre-book their accommodation. This ensures a smooth transition into their housing upon arrival, eliminating any concerns about being without accommodations. <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university has outlined the following accommodation costs:

1. **On-Campus Accommodation:**
   - Three-Seater Room: $2000 (per semester)
   - Two-Seater Room: $2500 (per semester)
   - These costs encompass food provisions as well and should be paid in a single payment.

2. **Off-Campus Accommodation:**
   - Annual cost: Approximately $800
   - This cost can be distributed across monthly installments.
   - Rent: Approximately $35 per month
   - Additional costs for self-cooking: Estimated between $20 to $25 per month.
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This comprehensive breakdown of costs and options provides both students and parents with a clear understanding of the financial considerations associated with on-campus and off-campus accommodations. It's essential for students to make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.
31/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 561 0490: For the on campus is it 2000 per semester or per year
31/08/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying. Just to reiterate, the costs provided earlier are indeed on an annual basis. If you have any more information to share or any other questions, feel free to let me know.
31/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 931 4288: Ok ,so it's a yearly cost right
31/08/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @263779314288. If you intend to stay on campus, the payment for your first semester's accommodation fee shall be settled upon your arrival in India. 

It's essential to note that this payment should align with your arrival date. However, in the event that you decide to change your accommodation preference and opt for off-campus housing, it's important to be aware that securing off-campus accommodation on the day of your arrival may not be feasible. 

Availability is limited, and options might be quite limited due to the high demand. Please keep these considerations in mind as you make your decision regarding your accommodation arrangements.
31/08/23, 2:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you've taken this into careful consideration, I recommend that we proceed with informing the university about your decision to stay on campus. Confirming your choice will allow the university to make the necessary arrangements in preparation for your arrival.

Kindly let me know your confirmation latest by today so that I can promptly convey this information to the university authorities.
31/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 931 4288: So one cannot be able to choose on arrival right
31/08/23, 2:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, @263779314288, your understanding is accurate. Given the limited availability of accommodations, our priority is to encourage our students to take proactive steps and make timely decisions. This approach ensures that they can secure their preferred housing option and avoid any challenges upon their arrival.
31/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 931 4288: Our concern is about securing both options for an autonomous decision
31/08/23, 2:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I completely comprehend your perspective, and I would undoubtedly share your sentiment. It's crucial to acknowledge that this is a peak period, and students are promptly securing their accommodations as soon as the opportunity arises. Delaying any further might put Ryan at risk of missing out on available options and subsequently facing the same difficulties.

Considering the circumstances, I strongly emphasize the significance of making a swift decision to ensure that Ryan's accommodation arrangements are managed effectively.
31/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 931 4288: If we choose to be in campus ,do the university officials allow a refund if you choose to be out of campus later
31/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 561 0490: OK, so for  the on campus accommodation l will have to carry $2000 right for the whole year
31/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 561 0490: Are there  any other additional costs?
31/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university's accommodation booking process operates on an annual basis. Given the constraints of limited available rooms, the university also needs to make timely decisions and allocate rooms accordingly. It's important to note that these decisions are not easily changeable throughout the year due to the logistics involved.

However, it's worth mentioning that starting from the second year, there will be the flexibility for you to opt for off-campus accommodation. By that time, you would have become more familiar with the campus environment and surroundings, allowing you to explore off-campus options independently.
31/08/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 561 0490: We opt to be in campus
31/08/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand Ryan. If you've taken this into careful consideration, I recommend that we proceed with informing the university about your decision to stay on campus. Confirming your choice will allow the university to make the necessary arrangements in preparation for your arrival.

Kindly let me know your confirmation latest by today so that I can promptly convey this information to the university authorities.
01/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 561 0490: Are there other African students in campus☺️
01/09/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know why do you need the contact number of other edoofians?
01/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 561 0490: I want to be in a friendly environment
01/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 561 0490: Hello
03/09/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Ryan,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Ryan 2K23JAN1318*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us.
