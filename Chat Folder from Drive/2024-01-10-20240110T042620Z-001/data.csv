B.Tech in Computer Science may provide more practical and industry-oriented education, while B.Sc in Computer Science may provide more theoretical and mathematical concepts. If one wants to work in the tech-world, B.Tech Computer Science is the best choice.  I can understand that you are having concern due to the duration of the course, is my understanding right ?

It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.  Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
292 - 09 Jan 2024 10:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.  In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
119 - 09 Jan 2024 09:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.  I hope you are clear about this now?
120 - 09 Jan 2024 09:05PM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am thank you
121 - 09 Jan 2024 09:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN , you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN  and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
122 - 09 Jan 2024 09:20PM - +263 78 790 1774: No ma'am
123 - 09 Jan 2024 09:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -  Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN  by paying your registration fee due.  If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.  If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
124 - 09 Jan 2024 09:39PM - +263 78 790 1774: Understood
125 - 09 Jan 2024 09:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well -  Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000 .  If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.  I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
126 - 09 Jan 2024 09:45PM - +263 78 790 1774: Clear ma'am
127 - 09 Jan 2024 09:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's great to hear.

45 - 09 Jan 2024 08:22PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alois.  I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
46 - 09 Jan 2024 08:22PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Alois will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Alois is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
47 - 09 Jan 2024 08:22PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
48 - 09 Jan 2024 08:22PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
49 - 09 Jan 2024 08:22PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.",No,Yes

109 - 09 Jan 2024 08:16PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nokutenda.  I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
110 - 09 Jan 2024 08:16PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Nokutenda will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Nokutenda is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
111 - 09 Jan 2024 08:16PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.

Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
37 - 09 Jan 2024 08:02PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Rutendo will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Rutendo is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well. <This message was edited>
38 - 09 Jan 2024 08:03PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
39 - 09 Jan 2024 08:03PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
40 - 09 Jan 2024 08:03PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.",No,No

Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
87 - 09 Jan 2024 08:14PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Tendai will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Tendai is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.

It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
89 - 09 Jan 2024 08:15PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
90 - 09 Jan 2024 08:15PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM?

Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Abigail is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter.  In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.",No,Yes

Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9 - 08 Jan 2024 01:55PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
19 - 08 Jan 2024 05:34PM - +263 77 709 8241: Due to the October examinations I could not handle both the examination pressure and processes online, hence I took a break from my social media platforms. Now as I await the announcement of my results, I decided to continue with the admission process
20 - 09 Jan 2024 08:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.  May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?

23 - 09 Jan 2024 09:17AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward in order to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your higher education.  According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
24 - 09 Jan 2024 09:28AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes surely
25 - 09 Jan 2024 09:48AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

27 - 09 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, dear.  *To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.*

28 - 09 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero.

33 - 09 Jan 2024 12:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case we would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, and after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
34 - 09 Jan 2024 12:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now every parent has a question that why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University.  Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
35 - 09 Jan 2024 12:27PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
36 - 09 Jan 2024 12:29PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The range of $2000 - $3000 includes the following - annual tuition fee, accommodation, food, and any other university aspects.",No,No

66 - 09 Jan 2024 09:44AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking, dear.  As per my records, Mr. Shivjeet was in the process of explaining the benefits of the *Endowment Program 2024*, am I correct?
67 - 09 Jan 2024 09:44AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes you are correct
68 - 09 Jan 2024 09:48AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education, and any queries regarding the plans explained by Mr. Shivjeet up until now?
69 - 09 Jan 2024 09:56AM - +263 71 438 0324: No I don't have any queries
70 - 09 Jan 2024 10:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. May I know if you are ready to move ahead with our discussion?
65 - 09 Jan 2024 09:28AM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm ok ,how are you?

71 - 09 Jan 2024 10:17AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yess I'm ready
72 - 09 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Continuing the previous conversation, let us move ahead.
73 - 09 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
74 - 09 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
67 - 09 Jan 2024 09:44AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes you are correct

Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.

Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
77 - 09 Jan 2024 11:06AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
78 - 09 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
79 - 09 Jan 2024 11:10AM - +263 71 438 0324: What if I fail to pay the first $450 on the date given by the university
80 - 09 Jan 2024 11:12AM - +263 71 438 0324: And since I preferred taking the august intake is there a chance whereby the registration fee will be required as early as January or February?
86 - 09 Jan 2024 11:28AM - +263 71 438 0324: Partly
87 - 09 Jan 2024 11:29AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
88 - 09 Jan 2024 11:30AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to secure the scholarship seat, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving your offer letter, as the number of scholarship seats is limited.  Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month.
89 - 09 Jan 2024 11:31AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly elaborate any other queries that you have.
90 - 09 Jan 2024 11:35AM - +263 71 438 0324: Does this mean I might receive the offer letter sometime this month and I will be required to pay the registration fee this month and the other next month
91 - 09 Jan 2024 12:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is correct that once your application process is complete and you have received an offer letter, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving the offer letter as per the university. However, with the help of *Endowment Program 2024*, you will have the option of paying 50% of the amount before the deadline given by the university, and the other 50% can be paid within the next 30 days of the initial deadline set by the university.
92 - 09 Jan 2024 12:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope that clears your query?
93 - 09 Jan 2024 01:28PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes thank you
94 - 09 Jan 2024 01:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, you are welcome. <This message was edited>
95 - 09 Jan 2024 01:33PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?

96 - 09 Jan 2024 01:39PM - +263 71 438 0324: May u please provide me with more information about it
97 - 09 Jan 2024 02:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, Blessing. Which aspect do you want me to explain?
98 - 09 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +263 71 438 0324: How my scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter I'm to secure considering I don't have my Alevel results
99 - 09 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
100 - 09 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
101 - 09 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
102 - 09 Jan 2024 02:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
103 - 09 Jan 2024 02:58PM - +263 71 438 0324: I now get it
104 - 09 Jan 2024 02:59PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you for explaining
105 - 09 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure, dear. Are you ready to move forward with the admission process?
106 - 09 Jan 2024 03:07PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm ready
107 - 09 Jan 2024 03:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe Mr. Shivjeet introduced you to the first two benefits of the Endowment Program. Would you like me to provide a brief overview of the same, or would you prefer to proceed with the next benefits?
108 - 09 Jan 2024 03:32PM - +263 71 438 0324: Let's proceed to the benefits

123 - 09 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
124 - 09 Jan 2024 05:36PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm clear
125 - 09 Jan 2024 05:38PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*  Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
126 - 09 Jan 2024 05:38PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
127 - 09 Jan 2024 05:53PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
128 - 09 Jan 2024 06:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,  *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*  Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.",No,No

I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8 - 08 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9 - 08 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
10 - 08 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
11 - 09 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 78 754 7995: How are you MS. Siddhi Sigh Hope you are doing well and enjoying your new year
12 - 09 Jan 2024 11:09AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am well, dear. Thank you for asking.  A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.  May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?",No,No

12 - 09 Jan 2024 08:36AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes, dear.  A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

15 - 09 Jan 2024 10:01AM - +263 71 137 6751: I couldn't proceed back then because I wanted to focus on my school work and financial constraints , now the major problem I face currently is financial constraints due to some family emergencies which had to be attended to
16 - 09 Jan 2024 10:34AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. May I ask, what exactly are the difficulties that you are currently facing?

20 - 09 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:  Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum  The registration amount ($750) has to be paid within 2 weeks of the date you receive your offer letter. Are you following? <This message was edited>
32 - 09 Jan 2024 11:36AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you must be preparing financially for your higher education?
33 - 09 Jan 2024 11:45AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes I understand
34 - 09 Jan 2024 11:46AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes but as I had highlighted before, a few emergencies came up
35 - 09 Jan 2024 11:57AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that certain unfortunate emergencies may arise and cause financial inconvenience for us. Your concern is related to the payment of the registration fees, which is a part of your first year of study. If I may ask, how are you preparing for your higher education?
36 - 09 Jan 2024 12:00PM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes the registration fee is my concern Am trying to find ways to earn and save up for my tertiary education so that I don't strain my parents much as am not the only person whose fees they pay
37 - 09 Jan 2024 12:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand, Caabilo. It is quite commendable that you are working hard to earn money yourself to sponsor your education. The Edoofa Scholarship Program operates on the same beliefs, providing you with opportunities to self-finance your higher education with the EWYL program. However, with the amount of work you are putting in, you must have some plans as to how you are going to proceed with your higher education?
38 - 09 Jan 2024 12:51PM - +263 71 137 6751: Plans in terms of ?
39 - 09 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Plans in terms of pursuing your higher education, dear.
40 - 09 Jan 2024 12:54PM - +263 71 137 6751: Maybe we are missing each other at some point can you give an example maybe
41 - 09 Jan 2024 12:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You mentioned that you wish to withdraw your application from the Edoofa scholarship program. I would like to understand what your plans for higher education will be.
39 - 09 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Plans in terms of pursuing your higher education, dear.

41 - 09 Jan 2024 12:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You mentioned that you wish to withdraw your application from the Edoofa scholarship program. I would like to understand what your plans for higher education will be.
42 - 09 Jan 2024 12:59PM - +263 71 137 6751: I do wish to withdraw my application I just want to put it on hold until mid February I think my parents would have had enough time to try gather the funds needed for the admission process
43 - 09 Jan 2024 01:00PM - +263 71 137 6751: If worst come to worst I might take a gap year
44 - 09 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that navigating a financial crisis is challenging, and it is entirely reasonable if you wish to put your application on hold until you have more financial stability. If I were in your position, I would likely consider the same approach. However, if you choose to put your application on hold, there is a specific procedure we follow for such instances. It's crucial to recognize that you have enrolled in a scholarship program that students strive to pursue on a global level, and you have successfully cleared the required processes. Your approach might have left a negative impact with the Academic Board. This program has a limited number of seats, with 69 students already securing their positions, leaving only 31 available for this month. If the seats get filled, you are at a risk of losing this opportunity altogether. As your admission officer, I want to ensure you are well-informed about the current status and the limited availability, allowing you to make an informed decision.
45 - 09 Jan 2024 05:39PM - +263 71 137 6751: Okay I fully understand
46 - 09 Jan 2024 05:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I ask how you are planning to accumulate funds for the same until mid-February?

14 - 09 Jan 2024 11:38AM - +263 77 625 6363: I don't think there are any major changes
15 - 09 Jan 2024 12:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's perfectly fine if you don't have any resolutions for the New Year; sometimes, focusing on perfecting what you currently have can be equally impactful and meaningful.  Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
16 - 09 Jan 2024 12:20PM - +263 77 625 6363: Last year there is a period I was writing my exams and that time I wasn't available
17 - 09 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that you were focused on it to perform your best during examinations.  May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your admission process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education?
18 - 09 Jan 2024 12:26PM - +263 77 625 6363: Yes absolutely
19 - 09 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to know, John. Before we move ahead with your application process, I believe we need you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:  *1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*  *2. O-Level Results*  *3.

14 - 09 Jan 2024 09:02AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that. Absolutely, meeting new people in a new environment and having new experiences bring about learning, and with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success.

22 - 09 Jan 2024 10:24AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Please do not worry. I believe Mr. Shivjeet had explained to you that the cost of your higher education will range from $2000 to $3000, am I correct?
23 - 09 Jan 2024 10:25AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm aware of that
24 - 09 Jan 2024 10:49AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.

25 - 09 Jan 2024 10:49AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

28 - 09 Jan 2024 10:50AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I am

36 - 09 Jan 2024 01:12PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes please
37 - 09 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
38 - 09 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
39 - 09 Jan 2024 01:24PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
52 - 09 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you are confusing the fee-breakup discussion with the Endowment Program discussion. Let me help you understand the difference better.  Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
53 - 09 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
54 - 09 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
55 - 09 Jan 2024 03:00PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky noted
56 - 09 Jan 2024 03:01PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay that's good well noted
57 - 09 Jan 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*  I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
58 - 09 Jan 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
59 - 09 Jan 2024 03:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
60 - 09 Jan 2024 03:17PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you and we'll noted
61 - 09 Jan 2024 03:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.",No,Yes

It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8 - 08 Jan 2024 02:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
20 - 09 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 78 222 0925: Greetings sir I could not partake for the admission in August as I was preparing for my final exams and now I am free and it is the right time to focus on university admissions
21 - 09 Jan 2024 10:36AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. Focusing on one's examinations is very important to perform at your best, and I am glad to hear that you were putting forth your best efforts.  May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your university application process?
22 - 09 Jan 2024 10:37AM - +263 78 222 0925: I think it's now the best time to focus on university admissions
23 - 09 Jan 2024 10:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are now ready to move ahead with your application process to ensure that you are able to secure a scholarship seat to the best university for your higher education.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24 - 09 Jan 2024 11:00AM - +263 78 222 0925: Yes I would like to know the costs for my admission process
25 - 09 Jan 2024 11:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:  Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum  *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
26 - 09 Jan 2024 11:17AM - +263 78 222 0925: Ok I have taken note of it
27 - 09 Jan 2024 11:19AM - +263 78 222 0925: Can I ask if it is always that the university is the one providing food and accomodation
20 - 09 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 78 222 0925: Greetings sir I could not partake for the admission in August as I was preparing for my final exams and now I am free and it is the right time to focus on university admissions

29 - 09 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Some universities provide with both food and accommodation, and in some don't. However with Edoofa, all food and accommodation costs are covered under the annual expense that was shared with you earlier that is $2000 - $3000.
24 - 09 Jan 2024 11:00AM - +263 78 222 0925: Yes I would like to know the costs for my admission process

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
36 - 09 Jan 2024 12:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
37 - 09 Jan 2024 12:42PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

57 - 09 Jan 2024 11:51AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, and the final decision to be made is yours. However, I was unable to understand your reason to withdraw as I am concerned for Sandile's higher education.
58 - 09 Jan 2024 11:52AM - +263 77 580 2889: She is not well for the mean time as she had explained already on the above messages

61 - 09 Jan 2024 12:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that medical expenses must be taking a toll on you. However, I am only inquiring about your plans for Sandile's higher education, as education is an aspect that is important to pursue despite facing challenges.
62 - 09 Jan 2024 12:31PM - +263 77 580 2889: Will look into that later but for the mean time we are focusing on her health

64 - 09 Jan 2024 02:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Mrs. Jaunda, I appreciate your perspective, and if you decide to focus on your child's education later on, that is entirely your call. However, I am a bit perplexed here. Based on our conversations over the past year, it seems there might be some underlying concerns that haven't been clearly communicated from your end. <This message was edited>
65 - 09 Jan 2024 02:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since August 2023, when Mr. Shivjeet reached out to help you understand the procedures for your university admission, you mentioned being occupied with exams, which we completely understood. However, subsequent interactions conveyed different reasons for unavailability, ranging from work commitments to health concerns.

If you want, you can refer to that document for your reference.
67 - 09 Jan 2024 02:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263775802889  while I understand that Sandile has been unwell, and I empathize with the challenges it brings. However, from our past discussions, it appears that future planning, a crucial aspect for parents, hasn't been addressed over the last couple of months and that is what has been leaving me perplexed. Maybe you can help me understand this better?
68 - 09 Jan 2024 02:50PM - +263 77 580 2889: She has been sick since she was in form 2   and again I wasn't lying about her been occupied by exams

69 - 09 Jan 2024 02:52PM - +263 77 580 2889: We don't have anything else to discuss on this matter and again if it impossible to refund us then that's okay no problem have a good day sir and kindly understand that we are now exiting the grouo and sandile is withdrawing from the program have a good day
70 - 09 Jan 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is perfectly reasonable, ma'am. However, if you place yourself in our position, we have been actively working for over a year on your child Sandile's higher education plans. As Sandile's admission officer, this situation leaves me both concerned and confused about the underlying issue. You mentioned that Sandile has faced health challenges since Form 2, and despite these constraints and the associated medical bills, your family sought the very best for her and her career. This commitment led to the decision for Sandile to pursue education abroad, and you enrolled her in the Edoofa scholarship program.
71 - 09 Jan 2024 03:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If I understand correctly, you made such a challenging decision because you recognized that if Sandile pursued education in Zimbabwe, she would be subjected to the same kind of healthcare available throughout her life, constrained by the economic conditions of your country, which are not conducive for her growth.
72 - 09 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, over the past couple of months, there seems to be a shift in decision, and you are considering giving up on everything that you have worked for for Sandile's better career. I am struggling to understand the situation better. Helping me understand the situation for the betterment of you and your child is a decision you, as a parent, have the right to make, and we certainly respect that. If you believe there is nothing more to discuss in this matter, it's important to acknowledge that eventually, Sandile would be at a loss since the decision made now directly impacts her career. Moving forward, we might not have the same opportunity to assist her.
73 - 09 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I ask you to take today's time to understand our perspective and also to refer to the refund policy shared with you in your acceptance letter to address the queries you raised.

16 - 08 Jan 2024 04:55PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.

22 - 09 Jan 2024 11:26AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to know Tadiwanashe. Before we move ahead with your application process, I believe we asked you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:  *1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*  *2. O-Level Results*  *3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

55 - 09 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, dear! With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
73 - 09 Jan 2024 01:28PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
74 - 09 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
75 - 09 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
76 - 09 Jan 2024 01:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
77 - 09 Jan 2024 01:39PM - +263 77 328 7663: No
78 - 09 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
79 - 09 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
80 - 09 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
81 - 09 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
82 - 09 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?

84 - 09 Jan 2024 02:37PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
85 - 09 Jan 2024 02:40PM - +263 77 328 7663: That's true
86 - 09 Jan 2024 02:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?  *1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)* *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)* *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
87 - 09 Jan 2024 02:48PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
88 - 09 Jan 2024 02:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -  *1. Reappear in A Level*  Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
93 - 09 Jan 2024 03:06PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes
94 - 09 Jan 2024 03:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,  *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*  Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
95 - 09 Jan 2024 03:29PM - +263 77 328 7663: Ok l understand
96 - 09 Jan 2024 03:37PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
97 - 09 Jan 2024 03:52PM - +263 77 328 7663: No
98 - 09 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
99 - 09 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
100 - 09 Jan 2024 04:22PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.  May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
35 - 09 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school. <This message was edited>

20 - 09 Jan 2024 12:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well. Thank you for asking.  A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.  May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

42 - 09 Jan 2024 02:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID. <This message was edited>
43 - 09 Jan 2024 02:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application. I hope the procedure is clear to you?

87 - 09 Jan 2024 05:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
88 - 09 Jan 2024 05:48PM - +263 77 815 6959: Okay mam
89 - 09 Jan 2024 05:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
90 - 09 Jan 2024 05:50PM - +263 77 815 6959: Noted If my parents failed to pay the first 450 before 25 January and then
91 - 09 Jan 2024 05:51PM - +263 77 815 6959: Please provide me with more information about it
92 - 09 Jan 2024 06:38PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this query with me. I would like to address it after sharing all the relevant details with you, so that you don't miss out on important aspects.
93 - 09 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
94 - 09 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
95 - 09 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
96 - 09 Jan 2024 06:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?",No,Yes

46 - 09 Jan 2024 10:53AM - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
47 - 09 Jan 2024 10:59AM - +263 78 786 4935: I believe soo
48 - 09 Jan 2024 11:31AM - Arshita: As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

50 - 09 Jan 2024 11:36AM - Arshita: Please understand that foreign education is just one challenge in this competitive world.

78 - 09 Jan 2024 02:11PM - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.

I have learnt from jesca that Edoofa offers a partial scholarship in which it helps us in financing our selfs through EWYL program in which we will not be receiving money but grants and credits. That will only be gotten out of hard work and commitment.  Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? Because I am a very hardworking student who has a lot of passion, dedication and commitment to my goals. And I want to fulfill my dreams through Edoofa because I was told about how great it is and I want to experience this as well.It's a passion. I'm just passionate and particular about how the human body works and making drugs to administer. I would like to introduce new things like new drugs that could help human body to function effectively.I lost my grandma to cancer and so that also triggered my passion for medicine and also interest in pharm D. I just have the determination of making new drugs for the incurable diseases  And I know Edoofa is a place for all of that.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.  Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

121 - 09 Jan 2024 03:37PM - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
122 - 09 Jan 2024 03:37PM - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.   1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

107 - 06 Jan 2024 12:04PM - Gurvinder: Mungala, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12 - 09 Jan 2024 03:30PM - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

14 - 09 Jan 2024 03:31PM - Harmehak: This is great
15 - 09 Jan 2024 03:32PM - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Claire, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  2. Parent’s Participation in the Process- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16 - 09 Jan 2024 03:50PM - Harmehak: Yes Sir
17 - 09 Jan 2024 03:50PM - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Claire, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

175 - 08 Jan 2024 11:22PM - Harmehak: Mr Nevison, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
176 - 09 Jan 2024 05:53AM - +263 77 392 5859: I agree but the situation is continuously worsening.

245 - 09 Jan 2024 07:22PM - Harmehak: Comfort, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
246 - 09 Jan 2024 07:22PM - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

280 - 09 Jan 2024 03:58PM - +263 71 256 8023: Section 5  Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?   From my point of view l disagree that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. Climatic events which destroy crops and disrupt food are disproportionately common in the region. Many parts of Africa experience irregular rainfall and extreme weather conditions which can lead to drought, floods and many more.  Flooding depletes soils of oxygen and increases disease infections and nitrogen losses. Flooding can significantly alter the level of plant available nutrients in the soil. Flooding causes soil erosion which takes valuable plant available nutrients and organic matter.  Drought  is another natural disaster which causes destruction of plants. Drought weakens plants and predisposes them to secondary invaders and opportunitic pests. These include diseases such as vascular wilts and root rots. The roots strive to uptake more water through their expansion and this ultimately adapts plants to minimize stomatal loss of water deficit. Plants are usually slow growing and stunted.  In Africa there is also high rates of veld fires which causes destruction of plants thereby causing shortage of food and wildlife. The climatic conditions in Africa are not reliable anymore because weather patterns can change any time. Farmers in African are also facing challenges such as lack ok technology, lack of machinery, lack of irrigations and lack of capital. Some farmers may even have challenge in attaining inputs such as fertilizers, seeds and pesticides. This thereby causes lack of enough food for everyone in the nation.   Africans  also face challenges such as transportation of their good because poor   transport systems such as roads and railway lines. Another reason why Africans have shortage of food is that, many African countries export their crops to other countries instead of keeping them for example storing grain in silos for future use for example during drought. This causes shortage of food because all of it has been exported. Many Africans have lack of education which causes them to not be aware of what a balanced diet is. Poverty also causes Africans to have poor diets. Poverty limits people's ability to purchase healthy food so as to have balanced diet. Poverty causes people to rely on affordable foods which might not be healthy or be able to complete the balanced diet.  Supply chain costs and related issues are a major obstacle to the renaissance of African agriculture. Making food supply chains more sufficient and profitable requires reliable and efficient delivery of the upstream goods and services, as well as downstream delivery of goods to the market.  Overpopulation in Africa may cause reduction in food adequacy, leading to inadequate food intake or intake of foods of poor nutritional quality and quantity.  However l believe that these challenges of having poor diets in Africa can be solved by teaching Africans about the importance of a banced diet.
281 - 09 Jan 2024 03:59PM - +263 71 256 8023: Section 6  My inspirational story  I come from humble beginnings. My parents work hard to provide for my siblings and l. Despite  our limited resources they instilled in me the importance of hardwork, perseverance and faith. These values are guiding me throughout my experience in life.  I faced many challenges while growing up but l never let them hold me back from achieving my goals. I'm working hard at school so that l can make my parents proud and reach my dreams. I'm determined to make something of myself and l believe in myself that l have an ability to succeed. Sometimes my parents face challenges such as paying for my school fees in time and also for my siblings but however they overcome the challenge all the time. Which inspires me to apply for a scholarship so that l can make their life easier and cater for my education.  My parents have always been a good example to me. They teach about the importance of education and life skills.  As a commercial student they always teach about entrepreneurship and having a side business so that l can make money for myself. This has always inspired me to work hard in whatever l do. We come from a middle class family, so this has always inspired me to work hard at school so that I can changes my family's lives for the better.   My family has always been my inspiration. This motivates me in becoming an excellent student. Ever since l was young l was alway being bullied for being dark in complexion and being fat. I believe that this is part of my inspirational story because l want to show those who doubted me that I can do better than them even with my flows. My parents always encourage me to focus on my books and things that are beneficial to my life. This is my inspirational story

64 - 09 Jan 2024 03:02PM - Kunal: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

100 - 09 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Kunal: Indeed, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?",No,No

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
64 - 09 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.  Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

119 - 09 Jan 2024 02:46PM - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for waiting!
120 - 09 Jan 2024 02:46PM - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
121 - 09 Jan 2024 02:51PM - +263 77 483 7125: How does one earn scholarship credits...I would like to earn them too
122 - 09 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
123 - 09 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.

81 - 09 Jan 2024 02:47PM - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
82 - 09 Jan 2024 02:47PM - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

It's essential to recognize that aspiring to become a pilot usually involves enrolling in an aviation school equipped with the required infrastructure. Currently, we do not have any partnerships with aviation schools, which is why we do not offer pilot training programs. However, for those interested in aviation-related career paths, we do offer alternatives, such as aerospace engineering courses and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Aviation Management.

155 - 09 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
156 - 09 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

159 - 09 Jan 2024 09:35PM - Pallika Edoofa: Tamikha,  we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
160 - 09 Jan 2024 09:35PM - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

81 - 09 Jan 2024 11:10AM - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.  I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
82 - 09 Jan 2024 02:45PM - +260 772018150: Good afternoon. I'm really sorry for the delayed replies, I have some technical difficulties with my phone
83 - 09 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Sahil Edoofa: Can you pease answer this ?
84 - 09 Jan 2024 02:58PM - +260 772018150: I feel like studying in India will grant me to tier experience and it will increase the chances of me getting a good job
85 - 09 Jan 2024 03:18PM - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing  As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
86 - 09 Jan 2024 03:20PM - +260 772018150: No
87 - 09 Jan 2024 03:23PM - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
88 - 09 Jan 2024 03:25PM - +260 772018150: Alright

92 - 09 Jan 2024 03:47PM - +260 772018150: The exchange rate of the dollar is at k25 meaning when we convert the $2000 the amount will be K50000 which is reasonable considering the fact that it caters for everything but it will be a struggle to source that amount of money. My parents are at the moment paying for my older Brother's tution fee which is close to that amount <This message was edited>
93 - 09 Jan 2024 04:19PM - Sahil Edoofa: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the higher quantum scholarship.

98 - 09 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
99 - 09 Jan 2024 05:00PM - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

337 - 09 Jan 2024 12:44PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

173 - 09 Jan 2024 11:51AM - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same. Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
174 - 09 Jan 2024 11:52AM - +260 763402858: No I don’t
175 - 09 Jan 2024 11:55AM - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.   This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!  So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it. Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
176 - 09 Jan 2024 12:18PM - +260 763402858: Yes I do
177 - 09 Jan 2024 12:41PM - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.  How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
178 - 09 Jan 2024 12:45PM - +260 763402858: About $1350-$2000
179 - 09 Jan 2024 12:52PM - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000.  So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.",No,No

Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as will be mentioned in the acceptance letter.* <This message was edited>
380 - 09 Jan 2024 11:25AM - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Birthwell's potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.

The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).  3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses and Basic University Expenses such as exam fee, Library Fee, Lab Fee

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

So he urged me to apply and be an Edoofian.   I want to be an Engineer (Aeronautical or Mechanical) and wish to reach the best in that field.  From the Testimonies I was listening to by the Edoofians already in the system I believe Edoofa can also help me to achieve my dreams by giving me the chance to enrol in some of the best universities. 2) My basic understanding is that Edoofa can help you to achieve your life dreams.  If you have passion and drive to work hard, with Edoofa the sky is the limit.

18 - 09 Jan 2024 11:10AM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
19 - 09 Jan 2024 11:11AM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

26 - 09 Jan 2024 01:08PM - +263 77 717 1803: As parents we are excited to have our son linked with Edoofa and pray that he will succeed in getting the scholarship.  I am his father with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Studies.  I used to manage well established companies, but unfortunately our economy took a downturn that led to the closure of many companies.  During our time at University the thrust was on strategic management and companies that needed muanagers of that calibre were many.  Now, with the Land reform process the economic structure changed.  Commercial farms that were the backbone of the agricultural sector were disabled.  Commercial Farmers left and the farms were subdivided into smaller portions and distributed to the locals.  This had an adverse effect on the industry performance.  The economy became informal.  I lost my job and got into the informally sector, in my case farming projects such as piggery, poultry etc.  I had hoped that we could access bank loans but this did not work out. The banking sector is struggling; we are a major risk to them.  Yes we are trudging in but unfortunately will not be able to make our son realise his dreams.  And this is where our joy came when we got to know about Edoofa.  We are confident of our son's performance; but we are handicapped financially.  My wife is a tailor but again this will not enable us to take our son to University.  What really motivates me to support our son to study abroad is the quality, focus and exposure that comes with studying abroad.  The world is now a global village and interaction at that level is extremely good for our son.  He will also increase his chances of employment outside Zimbabwe and ultimately help his family back home and his country as well.
27 - 09 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr and Mrs Dafi*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Runyararo*, right?

362 - 09 Jan 2024 11:54AM - Shubham Madhwal: @263779855588 As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Susan was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as it will be mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
363 - 09 Jan 2024 11:54AM - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Susan's potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board. <This message was edited>
