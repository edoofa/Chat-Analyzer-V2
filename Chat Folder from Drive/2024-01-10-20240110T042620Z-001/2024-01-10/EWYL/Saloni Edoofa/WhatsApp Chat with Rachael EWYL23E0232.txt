26/12/23, 3:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Rachael,
How are you?
26/12/23, 3:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
27/12/23, 4:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Rachael,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:43 PM - +91 95018 86958: I am working on students Ma'am
27/12/23, 4:43 PM - +91 95018 86958: One of them is Ruth Sakadzo

27/12/23, 4:44 PM - +91 95018 86958: I promise to share many forms
28/12/23, 9:46 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Rachael,
How are you?
28/12/23, 9:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to know this Rachael, genuinely delighted but this came when I asked the same to know. I see you as one of my best students, who is so obedient and jolly, the one who is working hard and I know for sure that you will get positive results from all this but then when you will not share your challenges or your progress with me, how will able to assist you? If you wish to discuss it over a call, then I can definitely do that as I always say.
28/12/23, 6:22 PM - +91 95018 86958: Noted Ma'am

29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

I feel some sense of pride and confidence that I have people who care for me and are constantly trying to push me to make my parent’s dreams come true but I also realize how it’s really me who has to act on these opportunities. I loved the workshops that happened today, it almost looked like a marathon full of learning. My plan is now catchis now to catch a breath, introspect on what needs to be done, and be ready for the race ahead.
