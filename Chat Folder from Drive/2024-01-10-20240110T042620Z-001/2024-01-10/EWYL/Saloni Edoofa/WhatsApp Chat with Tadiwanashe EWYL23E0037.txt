29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

9/1/24, 7:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: " It has been 6 months that I have been living in India and even though it took adapting to the environment, weather, and culture, it is so gratifying because it is a country full of resources that are so cheap and affordable. 
I was fortunate to come at a time when India hosted the G20 summit in 2023. The G20 summit is an annual international gathering of leaders from the world's 20 major economies, representing both developed and emerging nations. It was such a proud moment for me because fortunately this year The African Union became a full member of the G20 which happened under India’s presidency. I believe this will help the development process in Africa and draw investment to the continent which also means more opportunities for us here and back home. "
