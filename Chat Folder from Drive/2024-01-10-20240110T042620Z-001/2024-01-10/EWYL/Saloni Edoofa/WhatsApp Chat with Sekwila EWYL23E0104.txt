23/12/23, 4:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Sekwila,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 5:52 PM - +91 91158 66298: Sorry ma’am for the late reply…the students am in contact with are saying they want their results to come out first before they proceed with any process…I’m still trying to convince them though.
28/12/23, 2:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Sekwila,
How are you?

28/12/23, 4:02 PM - +260 96 6787650: Hi Saloni, hope you are well. I didn't realize that the grant comes this such conditions. Nevertheless we have engaging people here in Zambia and the biggest challenge we are facing is that people are hesitant to commit themselves because the kwacha has depreciated very much and others are saying they would rather wait for results before making any decisions. I hope this explanation helps. Regards
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

9/1/24, 7:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: What I loved about today the most is that these CEOs were not here just to teach us or promote their business. I mean I am happy they gave free samples to us to try them out!! But I see Edoofa really fostering partnerships because all of these companies can add so much value to my country. Brands who want to solve real problems like sanitation and hygiene for women. I already have planned to work hard to get employed here so that I can take this to Africa.
