08/01/24, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 520 0779: Thanks for telling me about this.Im really interested in finding out more about the Edoofa scholarship. Could you tell me more about the eligibility requirements
08/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Lamond, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

08/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Lamond, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: But if you are concerned about not having Chemistry in your A-levels, A Bachelor of Arts in Geography offers a promising pathway toward a successful career in Mining Engineering, regardless of prior subject choices.

Here's how pursuing Geography could complement your interest in Mining Engineering:

Diverse Knowledge Base: Geography explores various aspects of Earth sciences, encompassing physical geography, environmental studies, and resource mapping. This broad knowledge base is highly relevant to understanding mining terrains and geological formations.

Geological Insights: Geographic studies often delve into geology, providing insights into landforms, resource distribution, and terrain analysis. This knowledge is invaluable for a career in Mining Engineering, especially when evaluating potential mining sites.

Environmental Understanding: Mining Engineering involves navigating environmental regulations and sustainability practices. Geography offers insights into environmental impact assessments, land-use planning, and sustainable resource management, essential aspects of responsible mining practices.

Data Analysis and Spatial Skills: Geography emphasizes spatial analysis, cartography, and geographical information systems (GIS), skills highly transferable to Mining Engineering. Understanding spatial data and analysis methods are crucial for site assessments and resource management.

While traditional engineering paths often require specific subjects, a BA in Geography equips you with foundational knowledge and skills essential for success in Mining Engineering. It's a unique avenue to grasp essential concepts and gain a broader understanding of the Earth's composition and resource distribution."
