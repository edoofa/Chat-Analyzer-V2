19/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Okay.

19/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Interesting
19/12/23, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
19/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 076 9689: No
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Okay
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Please ask your parent to come online and share their understanding of the costs
19/12/23, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

19/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 688 0015: As a parent I'm grateful that your fee are affordable  to an extent that I can afford to meet the fee
20/12/23, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good afternoon, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Okay
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would now like to brief you about the EWYL Program
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 12:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Okay
20/12/23, 12:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Yes
21/12/23, 12:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting a response
21/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Yes
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 076 9689: $1500-$2250
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/12/23, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 076 9689: Yeah true
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is this well understood?
21/12/23, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are we connected?
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

              Section 5
A genocide is a systematic way of killing a racial or cultural group. This can be caused by racism, when one group will regard itself as a superior group. Genocide can lead to many problems to both humans and the environment.

In Rwanda, after genocide, there will be depopulation. This is because of the killing of some inferior,  weak groups of people. People may also evacuate the state which may also lead to the reduction of population in the country. Therefore, genocide can affect the population of the country mostly by death of the citizens.

There can be also the destruction of  infrastructure. People may destroy the infrastructure for example power lines, fuel stations, roads, buildings among others. This can affect the life of the citizens for example there will be some high costs of repairing the damaged property.

Genocide may also lead to lack of lndependence to some individuals  especially the defeated ones. People may be forced to join the strong group and due to their weaknesses they may surrender themselves to the superior group. This may lead to lack of lndependence to the weak groups.
 
There can also be family disintegration due to death and migration. People may migrate to countries where there is peace and stability. This may cause people not to come back to Rwanda again. Parents may migrate and left behind their children and this can made them to be slaves. Therefore, genocide may lead to family disintegration. 

Moreso, there can be reconstruction of the infrastructure. The people of rwanda may want to rebuild their country again after some heavy damages. 
. 
There can be some enforcement of laws for example the laws of encouraging peole to procreate in order to increase  the population. Those who procreate may be awarded by the government . 
 




Section 6
Have you ever been inspired in life? Now let me tell you my inspirational story about the disabled young man. 

People who are disabled are seen as  burdens. There are looked down by the people in their community. Once upon a time, there was a boy by the name Peter.
He was  crippled  and unfortunately, was an orphan. He used to stay with his loving grandmother in the village of Mavhuradonha and later on he was taken bya his brother to Harare. His brother Thomas loved him so much but her wife did not like him as she saw him as a burden in her life. Peter was a boy who liked learning and that was the reason why he was taken by his brother.

Thomas talked to his wife about Peter 's educational issues. Thomas and his wife quarreled about the school fees of Peter. Thomas wanted Peter to go to a better school where the fees was a bit high but his dissagreed with him as she wanted him to go to a poor school for them to save money. 

It took about three months for Peter to start going to school. His brother had no other option than to listen to his wife. Peter started to go to a school with no standards but as the boy who liked to learn, he continued to work hard. 

He finished his primary level and proceeded to secondary level. At form four, he came out with better results. His brother was so proud of him while his wife was jealous. Thomas's wife planned to throw Peter out of the house but her husband stopped her. Peter faced a lot of challenges at that house. 
. 
Later on Peter was sent to the village. His grandmother was too old and their neighbors helped them to do the chores. Peter started to do music but unfortunately he had no support. He continued to do his music. One day when a famous musician came to the village to do his show, Peter was as happy as a baby. Peter was the first person to be at the place. He had an opportunity to go at the stage and perform in front of the famous musician named Jah_prayzah. Jah_prayzah liked Peter's performance and decided to sponsor him. 

The people in the village, instead of them to be happy for him, they gave him some bad advise of quiting the music carrier. Peter didn't listen to them and continued to chase his dreams. He was sponsored by Jah_prayzah as he was promised. 

He started to sing his music until when  the whole country supported his music and his brother's wife was shocked to see Peter on the television, performing together with Jah_prayzah. 
   
Finally Peter achieved his dreams due to mich effort he put as well as appreciating his sponsor.
