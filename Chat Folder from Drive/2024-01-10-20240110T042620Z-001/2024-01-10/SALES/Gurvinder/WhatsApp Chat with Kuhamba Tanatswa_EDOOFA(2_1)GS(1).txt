*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 9:32 am - +27 78 814 2121: Morning
03/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Mafunga, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, is that correct?
03/01/24, 10:20 am - +27 78 814 2121: Yes correct
03/01/24, 10:52 am - +27 78 814 2121: Helo
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
03/01/24, 1:59 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Myself I dont have much info if you can right light to me what you offer for my daughter and what are the requirements
03/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Well nothing much, he just sent me a fo online saying it's for a schoolarship form and l saw it as an opportunity and went for it
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 895 7163: Yes because l feel like my parents won't be able to sustain me for my tertiary education but lm someone who is ambitious that's why l went for it
03/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tanatswa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I guess l have
03/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 895 7163: I wasn't available for the counseling session because l did not have data but because l now have it , l will be available
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tanatswa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

03/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 895 7163: There will be a financial strain, my mom cannot support the four of us at once and as you know teritiary fees are very high
03/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: So before knowing about Edoofa, what were your plans financially to pursue higher education?
03/01/24, 3:58 pm - +27 78 814 2121: I am following up as a parent
03/01/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 8:19 am - +27 78 814 2121: Noted good morning
08/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Mr Mafunga, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/01/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  


1. Bachelor in Pharmacy

2. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Technology in Biotechnology Engineering
08/01/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: And if you want Tanatswa to pursue Engineering, I can offer her those courses as well.
08/01/24, 8:51 am - +27 78 814 2121: All is well
08/01/24, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: May I know, which course you want to go ahead with?
08/01/24, 11:41 am - +27 78 814 2121: Bachelor of Science in Medical laboratory technology would do for her
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
08/01/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Tanatswa achieving it.
08/01/24, 11:53 am - +27 78 814 2121: She can achieve that with no doubts
08/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: So Shall I brief you about the course?
08/01/24, 11:55 am - +27 78 814 2121: Yes
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: *Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.
08/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: *Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
08/01/24, 12:00 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Understood sounds good for her
08/01/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: As a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Tanatswa, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is she willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way in order to transform her career?
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Will encourage her at length and I do not doubt her capabilities
08/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that she us willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want her to study abroad and not in your country?
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - +27 78 814 2121: In my country they  are under resourced and the facilities es are limited and tuitions are very high.
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for her to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to make her study abroad, but can you share how studying abroad can help her to contribute her learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Surely that will be a great strand considering the shortage of critical skills that will a mile stone and the development of under developed countries there by bringing something that is scarce and improve the health care. In africa we have high shortage of special skills in the health sector.
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mr Mafunga, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Yes I do agree, but they are always pace setter and experience will tell and the needs of the country by that time
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 78 814 2121: That true and India has most of the best doctors operating in African countries. Their experts are transforming African countries.
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

08/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mr Mafunga, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - +27 78 814 2121: Is the scholarship 100% sponsored
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - +27 78 814 2121: What else is expected from parents in support of the child  and any other expenses is involved.
08/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - +27 78 814 2121: By almeans will try yo meant the requirements. It's only that I and my child we are in different locations
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your situation Mr Mafunga, and I am here to guide you for a better education for your child.
