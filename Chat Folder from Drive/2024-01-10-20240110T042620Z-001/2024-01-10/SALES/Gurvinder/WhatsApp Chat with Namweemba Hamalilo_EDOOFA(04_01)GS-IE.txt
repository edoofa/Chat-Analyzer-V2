*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 10:48 am - +260 768210904: Good morning
08/01/24, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: Well Namweemba as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

1. Affordability: Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

2. Eligibility: As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

3. Length of the program: Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
08/01/24, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
08/01/24, 10:57 am - +260 768210904: Okay then can I change to Engineering
08/01/24, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: May I know, which branch of Engineering you are interested in?
08/01/24, 11:05 am - +260 768210904: Aviation
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 11:07 am - +260 768210904: Okay
08/01/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: Namweemba basically we offer Aerospace Engineering, And you are eligible for the same too,  but the universities which offer these course have to invest a lot in the infrastructure and the practical education as well, so even after the scholarship the cost will be higher as compared to the rest of the Engineering courses
08/01/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: Choosing B.Tech Mechanical Engineering over Aerospace Engineering offers broader career prospects. Mechanical Engineering provides a versatile skill set applicable across industries, including aerospace. It opens doors to various sectors such as automotive, energy, and manufacturing, offering a diverse range of opportunities. This versatility enhances employability, providing a solid foundation for a successful career in engineering.
08/01/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: https://worldscholarshipforum.com/aerospace-engineering-vs-mechanical-engineering/
08/01/24, 11:16 am - +260 768210904: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 11:19 am - +260 768210904: B.Tech mechanical engineering will be okay
08/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.
08/01/24, 11:27 am - +260 768210904: Okay
08/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
08/01/24, 11:47 am - +260 768210904: Yes
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: *Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine
08/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: *Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
08/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: *Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.
