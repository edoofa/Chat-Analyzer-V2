*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 087 0781: Hello I'm happy to hear from you
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 087 0781: You contacted the right person
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 087 0781: Here is my other number, this one is currently not functional,
30/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 087 0781: This is the number 0789282752
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder added +263 78 928 2752
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Thulisile,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I understand
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Thulisile, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Hester, is that correct?
30/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes
30/11/23, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Hester, also do tell me whether you learnt about Hester’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
30/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 928 2752: I got to learn that it provided him with an opportunity to fulfill his dreams related to higher education and that it is a work-study model that helps people in need of employment and funding for a higher education.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: That is correct.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay sir
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes that's really what I'm looking for
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Thulisile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes sir
30/11/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Thulisile, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
30/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I'm Thulisile Siwela, a lady aged 18, I have a passion in food, and I'd love to work in the Food Industry as a nutritionist of food technologist and maybe even a chef.  I completed my O'level in 2021 with 4 A's and 5 B's and I proceeded to do my Alevel at bus, but I haven't yet wrote my exams. My strengths are : good communication skills, ability to interact with new people, ability to adapt to a new environment . I'm also a fast learner and quick to grasp info and I believe my IQ is high. My weakness so far is I tend to be a perfectionist.
30/11/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Great answer, Thulisile.
30/11/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: So Thulisile, could you kindly tell me how much *Bulawayo Adventist High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 928 2752: I was born in a family of 6 children and I'm the last born. Mother died in 2011 when I was 7 and things just changed thereafter. Our father got depression and the farm which was our source of income trembled and we almost lost everything. Our father then remarried 7months later and he sent us to live on our own in town. So right now we are a child headed family and my sister being the bread winner
30/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 928 2752: My school fees is USD $324  per term and my father is the one who pays it with help from my sister and brother too
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear about this, Thulisile.
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same? <This message was edited>

30/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 928 2752: It's just been a natural love for food that I've had since a young age. Food is like a puzzle that needs to be put together, from the way it is harvested to it being prepared, to it being cooked ,to it being eaten, to it being used up by the body, it's just something that fascinates and is interesting to me. I love discovering and knowing more about the foods that we consume and the usefulness of it in our lives because basically without food we just won't exist
30/11/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
30/11/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?

30/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
30/11/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*
30/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 928 2752: I'll considere doing that but allow me to research on it
30/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the course.
30/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
30/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay that's really an interesting course
30/11/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
30/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes and it covers most of the things I'm interested in
30/11/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
30/11/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
08/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
09/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Sorry for replying late I'm coming from church
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 928 2752: I think the best way to improve my country's education is donating material such as textbooks, computers and helping in renovating infrastructure if schools. I believe I'll make it in life and be a successful someone, having said that with my successes I'll offer this kind of help to schools in need
11/12/23, 8:20 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes sir
11/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Thulisile, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes I do
11/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/12/23, 7:25 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

14/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 928 2752: No we don't
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/12/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 928 2752: That really accomodates people who have lesser income
15/12/23, 7:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 928 2752: Noted
15/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Thulisile what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
15/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 928 2752: That's really good
15/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
15/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Thulisile, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I understand
15/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

15/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes I think it will be beneficial to me
15/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thulisile, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I understand
15/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes it is
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Thulisile, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes they are
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes I have
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes
15/12/23, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Thulisile as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
15/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 928 2752: $1500
15/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Thulisile, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I see
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes
15/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Thulisile basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Okay
15/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
15/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 928 2752: No
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Thulisile, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 928 2752: Yes I understand
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
15/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 928 2752: No I don't have any questions
15/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
15/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
