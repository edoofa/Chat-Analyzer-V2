08/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Aaron, and Mrs Chongo!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/01/24, 10:44 am - +260 772287526: Good morning sir,
You have contacted the right person. I am  online and ready to discuss the scholarship.

Your positive response will be highly appreciated.
08/01/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Aaron,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 10:50 am - +260 772287526: Thank you very much Mr.Gurvinder, this will be a great opportunity for me to further  my studies. I’m kindly asking if you may assist me with the requirements for the scholarship.
08/01/24, 10:59 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Aaron, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, is that correct?
08/01/24, 11:02 am - +260 772287526: Yes Mr. Gurvinder, I got to know the program from Kooji.
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kooji’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 772287526: So I heard about the Edoofa from Kooji and he told me that it is a program that believes that education is for everyone and so they offer scholarships to those who seek higher education abroad  to receive the best education in another country.
08/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 772287526: And he says his journey with Edoofa has been long but they have taught Him a lot about Edoofa and what it takes to make it in the professional workplace  and that the opportunity is a life changing one
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 9:17 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
08/01/24, 9:21 pm - +260 772287526: Good evening Mr. Gurvinder, I am sorry for the late response I had a busy day today however I’ll be free tomorrow during your working hours. I will let you know where I need clarification in order to complete my application. Thank you very much have a good night.
09/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
09/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but I am under the weather today and unable to continue the sessions today, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
