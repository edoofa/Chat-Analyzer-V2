06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Afternoon ma'am l am now available

07/12/23, 1:18 am - +263 78 480 9500: Well, l discussed the the financial aspect with my parents. So, from my own point of view it is really hard for them to cater for my tertiary education abroad but,with greater hopes maybe they will make ends meet but the probability of that is slim.

 For the financial strategy we have none for now but we will try to tackle the issue and come up with a solution.
07/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?

07/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great!!

07/12/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Greetings ma'am I am ready for the session
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this.
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Well, l discussed with my family about it and they said it is hard for them to provide about $2000-$3000 per year
11/12/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Walter, But have you discussed about the EWYL Program that helps you to reduce your own tuition fees by making you self finance your own higher education!
11/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I did not discussed about that with them
11/12/23, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity and further students get a chance to self-finance their own higher education by working on the EWYL (earn while you learn) projects which allow you to earn 50-100$ worth scholarships every month that will reduce your tuition fees and lessen the burden on your parents.
11/12/23, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Don't you think it is beneficial!
11/12/23, 7:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you all are doing well today,

May I know if you are available for the session now?
12/12/23, 9:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Afternoon ma'am, sorry for the delays with my parents and they are not sure if the EWYL program is a sure thing to get, is it? If l join EWYL program how much will l earn per semester and how much will my tuition fee be reduced.
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Of course, it is beneficial.
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 480 9500: This is interesting and it is indeed of great help
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 480 9500: So basically what is the type of work that l will be doing
13/12/23, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
13/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Ok thank you ma'am now l do understand it all better
13/12/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Walter.
13/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, By seeing all these facts, Is your family willing to support you financially?
13/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 480 9500: They are both not using WhatsApp right now, so l tell them every detail about this program and these precious facts l'm pretty sure they are going to accept it and they will be willing to support me financially.
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, have you not discussed about the program with them yet?
13/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I did but not about these new facts like EWYL program and the outcomes of EWYL program.
13/12/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Walter, Please have a discussion with them once again and let me know if they will be able to manage the remaining expenses.
13/12/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I would like to share some glimpses of the school where you are currently having A level Harare High is one of our associate schools in Zimbabwe with the child of a Senior Teacher studying here in India through the Edoofa program
13/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Thank you ma'am. I will do that as soon as possible.
13/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Oh that is awesome thank you for the news
13/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 480 9500: No l don't know them when did they wrote their A Level examination, if it is not this year then l do not know any because l did my O level at Highfield High School not Harare High School.

29/12/23, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Walter,

How are you doing today?
02/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Greetings ma'am, how are you doing.
02/01/24, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing fine.
02/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moving forward, I kindly request that you share your O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for a more comprehensive overview.
02/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Ok ma'am
02/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 480 9500: <Media omitted>

02/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 480 9500: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
02/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 480 9500: As for now, l haven't applied to any University abroad
02/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Yes, l am confident about it.

02/01/24, 4:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
03/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Afternoon ma'am.
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Walter?
03/01/24, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through the document, so, proceeding further, I would like to know why you haven't opted for Biology in your A level if your were interested in the Medical field?
03/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I am okay
03/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 480 9500: I'm more comfortable with calculations than essay so l chose physics.
03/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Walter, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
03/01/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*
*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*
*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 480 9500: But at my school, they said there is no such combination which includes biology and physics
03/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 480 9500: So l had to choose physics over biology because l enjoyed calculations at my O level
03/01/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
03/01/24, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through the above information and let me know which course you would like me to explain? <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 480 9500: But l was also doing additional mathematics can't that also be a advantage for me to study medicine
03/01/24, 2:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, I understand that your current subject combination lacks biology, but you are keen on exploring alternative paths within the medical field. these courses will eventually make you a Doctor, so, please let me know which course you would like me to explain?

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*

08/01/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
08/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 480 9500: Yeah sure these are amazing facts. Since lndian degrees are globally recognized it is a great opportunity for me to study in lndia so that l will recognised in various places around the world. Which gives me a great chance to participate and contribute in the health field. Also lndia have got quality education it will help me to have a great academic experience.
08/01/24, 11:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Walter, That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 480 9500: I don't know exactly but approximately $15 000 to $17000
08/01/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 480 9500: Yes it is affordable
08/01/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 480 9500: No
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/01/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
08/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Indeed l will be benefiting since it makes my education more affordable and l will be gaining more experience in terms of employment.
08/01/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families. <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 480 9500: Yes
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 480 9500: 1
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
