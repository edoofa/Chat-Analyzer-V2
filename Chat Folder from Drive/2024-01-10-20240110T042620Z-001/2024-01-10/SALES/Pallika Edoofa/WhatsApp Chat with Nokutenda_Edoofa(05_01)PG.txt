06/01/24, 12:35 pm - +263 71 461 4401: How many points required for my program?
06/01/24, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nokutenda, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/01/24, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Victor, Please let me know the name of the person you have added.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors
