09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Oooh that's wonder
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: *wonderful
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Do I guess I qualify for this right
09/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: kindly be informed that upon successful completion of the interview and eligibility test, and upon meeting the eligibility criteria, a student will qualify, regardless of their A-level results.
09/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 865 4482: That's good to hear
09/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
09/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 865 4482: I researched a bit about foreign education
09/01/24, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Thank you
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Can I ask you something
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please ask
09/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 865 4482: This is a scholarships program or am going to pay for my fees alone
09/01/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
09/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: As for transport and accommodation my parents will manage
09/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: What is the approximate expense for accommodation
09/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Is it possible for me to work there whilst schooling
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, please note that you have the opportunity to self-finance your higher education through project work. Once you are deemed eligible and successfully enrolled, your admission to the earn-while-you-learn program will commence. This program allows you to earn scholarship credits ranging from 50-100$, which will contribute to a reduction in your tuition fees.
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Okay I understand
09/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!

09/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, I would like to know that if you were interested in Medical field, so, why haven't you pursue Physics in your A level.
09/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 865 4482: I failed it in my Ordinary level
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Is physics considered as a necessity
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Merit, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
