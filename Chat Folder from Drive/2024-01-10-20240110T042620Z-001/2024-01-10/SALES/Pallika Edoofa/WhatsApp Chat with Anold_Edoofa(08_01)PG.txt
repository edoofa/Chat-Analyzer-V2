09/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 719 8307: Thats for form 6(UpperSix)these two👆.. Thats what i remember
09/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 719 8307: Am still on it,was waiting for portals of varoius Universities to opn like leeds University in Uk and others but they need results first so am also waiting for the results which will come soon
