Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

09/01/24, 9:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
09/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 812 1216: Ooh sry I thought that it would be 9 in the evening
09/01/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
09/01/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
