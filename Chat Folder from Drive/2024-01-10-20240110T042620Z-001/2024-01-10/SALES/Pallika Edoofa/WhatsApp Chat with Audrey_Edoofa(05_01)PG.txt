08/01/24, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Duncan, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 267 9624: Financially I'm not that strong as I said earlier on  as I have been relying on my sister it all depends with fee structure
08/01/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Duncan, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
