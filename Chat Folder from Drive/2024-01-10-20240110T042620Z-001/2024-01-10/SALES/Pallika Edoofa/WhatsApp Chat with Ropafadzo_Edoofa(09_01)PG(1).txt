09/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 126 9094: Noted,, bt what do you mean by offering 50-100 %
09/01/24, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ropafadzo, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
