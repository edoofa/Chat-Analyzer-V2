08/01/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
