Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

21/12/23, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 495 4094: No may you please help
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay ma'am
21/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Do you provide working permits as well
21/12/23, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyasha, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Nyasha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay thank you for the explanation
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are you thoughts on the same?
21/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please can you answer this question that I just asked?
21/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 495 4094: May you please explain to me ma'am I'm not understanding it
21/12/23, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please I would like to understand your thoughts on the cost of education that Edoofa provides.
21/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 495 4094: okay, it's really helpful considering how the actual cost are without the help of Edoofa, and it really unleashes the burden for many students
21/12/23, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Indeed Nyasha.
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
21/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 495 4094: That is fantastic
21/12/23, 4:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 495 4094: I really appreciate your clarification ma'am

22/12/23, 9:39 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 9:39 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 495 4094: Yes I now understand
22/12/23, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/12/23, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
22/12/23, 12:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
22/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Employability through practical training
22/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 495 4094: My apologies ma'am
22/12/23, 1:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Nyasha, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
22/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes ma'am
22/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you mentally and financially for your higher education?
22/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes they are
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: *please I would want your parents @263776767875 @263776135441 to acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note*.
22/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Will inform them cause they're currently offline
22/12/23, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Nyasha, mean while we can move ahead with your application form.
22/12/23, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Nyasha, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now that we have covered everything from the counseling session, let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes I'm ready
22/12/23, 2:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyasha as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 495 4094: $1500 to $2250
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: We know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the word which is why we have decided for this slowdown period that a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.

Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350
22/12/23, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
22/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Wow 👏👏
22/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Ok
22/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay ma'am
22/12/23, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyasha basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/12/23, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay thank you for this clarification
22/12/23, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyasha, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
22/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Ok
22/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyash can you please share your understanding on the same?
22/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Will do so ma'am
22/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please, I am waiting for your response.
22/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 495 4094: From my own understanding about the financial aspect of the program and how it helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself.


Firstly the program will help in reducing the burden by offering a certain percentage of scholarship for example 50% . This means the student won't have to pay all the amount himself and is also allowed to earn while he is learning. Meaning he can finish the payments when he is earning at the same time as learning
22/12/23, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 495 4094: I'm following
22/12/23, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear about the financial aspects?
22/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes I'm now clear
22/12/23, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Nyasha and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
22/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes I do
22/12/23, 2:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
22/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 495 4094: No I'm not
22/12/23, 3:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 3:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/12/23, 3:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/12/23, 3:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Of course ma'am
22/12/23, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
22/12/23, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

22/12/23, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/12/23, 3:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
22/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 495 4094: For now I'm still okay
22/12/23, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/12/23, 3:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

28/12/23, 1:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
28/12/23, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want your father to be active so he can share what all he happen to understand from Mrs. Ruth's experience. And I'll be more than happy to clear all the queries.
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay let me inform him
28/12/23, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

05/01/24, 12:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning  How are you doing today ?
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 613 5441: Morning ma'am
05/01/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/01/24, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

05/01/24, 12:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th or 13th January 2024 for $200 and the 12th or 13th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th or 13th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
06/01/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but unfortunately, I didn't receive a response. Lately, our conversations have been a bit disrupted due to the timing not aligning with our available hours. I remain hopeful that we can have a smoother conversation on monday at 10:00 a.m., CAT. Your availability would be greatly appreciated; however, if you're unable to make it, please understand that, as an organization, we strive to be fair to all students.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
