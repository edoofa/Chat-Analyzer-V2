Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Ok thank you
05/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Yes they do
05/01/24, 5:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Moreblessing shall I brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students?
05/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Yes l will be glad
05/01/24, 5:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

05/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Ummm no l dont think they will be able to afford the fees because to tell the truth they cant even afford to pay  for my little sisters fees in time which is $50 us dollars
05/01/24, 5:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what are the challenges that you are facing?
05/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 77 352 0478: My dad's salary cannot fulfil all our needs
05/01/24, 5:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
05/01/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Ok thank you very much for your time ,Same to you
05/01/24, 6:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: So may I know how are you now planning to fund for your tertiary education ?
05/01/24, 6:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Africa for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zambia,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zambia is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/01/24, 8:07 pm - +263 77 352 0478: I think if l find a donor and a job l can be able to fund for my education
05/01/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Yeah l would agree that it costs a lot
05/01/24, 10:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

08/01/24, 3:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: And may I know if they are willing to support you financially for your higher education abroad?
08/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Yes they arebut unfortunately they are financially unstable
08/01/24, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what are the challenges they are facing?
08/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 352 0478: They wont be able to pay the fees its too much for them
08/01/24, 4:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Considering that you have mentioned financial problems. For me to have a better understanding and align with your thoughts on how are your daily expenses being catered to since you mentioned you want to pursue your tertiary education abroad, I would like to understand that is your parents aware of the same and have they made any future plans on how is going to cater your higher education for example, any investment or saving?
08/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Yes they thought they would find someone who is willing to fund me such as a donor and help me with furthering my studies as the money they saved is not enough
08/01/24, 4:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know have they found the donor who will be supporting financially in your higher education?
08/01/24, 4:48 pm - +263 77 352 0478: No they are still looking
08/01/24, 4:48 pm - +263 77 352 0478: No they are still searching
08/01/24, 5:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Moreblessing, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 5:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you will be eligible for the higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Ok l think its better
08/01/24, 6:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, in that case, may I know if would you still need a donor to support you for your higher education abroad?
08/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 352 0478: Unfortunately yes l do
08/01/24, 6:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 7:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: In that case, I would want you to take today's time and go through the above document with your parents and therefore I would schedule our session for tomorrow at 10 AM Cat.
