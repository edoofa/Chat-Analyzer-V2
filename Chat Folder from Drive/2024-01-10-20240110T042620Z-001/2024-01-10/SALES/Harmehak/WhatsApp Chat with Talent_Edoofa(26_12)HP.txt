So did you go through the shared video please?
27/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I went through it
27/12/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: That's great,

How was your experience?
27/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 765 7687: It was good I got to know more about the Edoofa scholarship program , I got elightened more about how the program works .I found the video very interesting. Seeing my fellow brothers and sisters living their dreams it's motivating.
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Talent
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Talent, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Nigel!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
27/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 765 7687: I learnt that the Edoofa scholarship program is a program which was made to ensure affordability and employability of tertiary education. The Scholarship program is partially funded ranging from 50%-80% and I learnt that after the scholarship has funded partially my tertiary education fees the remaining amount would be ranging from $2000-$3000 per year . The Scholarship program will  further ease the burden of paying the fees through the EWYL program whereby students participate in online or part-time internship this enables them to earn scholarship credits which then reduce the fees which they are required to pay . 

Nigel further enlightened me about how the scholarship program is unique from other scholarships. My friend articulated the fact which caught my attention about the nurturing which you are given by the scholarship program through counselling and the motivation which they give you in order to work hard . He said the counselors advise on career paths which are in demand so that there is a minimised risk of unemployment after attaining your degree .

Nigel emphasized the need for hardwork in order to attain scholarship credits .He comforted me because I was afraid of being stereotyped he told me that indians are friendly and India is a culturally diverse country. He told me that this scholarship program is nurturing to the point that they even welcome you at the airport once you have arrived in India and then they leave you at your university where you will be learning. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 765 7687: Should I continue?
27/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Talent!

I am glad you had a detailed discussion.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You can surely add more.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay
27/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Yes please
27/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 765 7687: I learnt that the Edoofa scholarship program offers academic degrees in India for various courses which have an affiliation from Indian government bodies such as the UGC and are recognized all over the world . This ensures employability.

The Edoofa scholarship ensures three aspects that you become a winner in life which include Knowledge, skills and attitude.
 
To shade more light about these aspects .
1 knowledge which comes from education and my  internationally recognized degree will be proof of that 
2 skill is what I will acquire through learning and working harder .
3 Attitude is a reflection of the person I will become after all these experiences <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, Talent.

I am glad you had a thorough discussion with Nigel!
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss the details with your parents too?
27/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I did
27/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Talent, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD John Tallach high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 765 7687: John Tallach high school fees per term Is $600USD.At my school I was in the commercials class and I am always fascinated by accounting and I find it interesting . I have always dreamed of becoming a chartered Accountant. I would like to study accounting for my tertiary education.

My strengths include I am a hardworking student .My school also recognized me for that by awarding me an academic badge . I am committed to learning, I am success driven , I am a good communicator, I am confident and I have the willingness to take on challenges.For my weaknesses I tend to struggle with procrastinating but I tend to overcome it .As a hobby I like socializing, playing soccer or watching it and working out .

My father is a constractor and is also self employed whilst my mother is self employed.The highest level of education which both my parents attained was advanced level through financial hardships but they have a strong passion to see me going beyond their level . They believe in quality education as the key to success and this has resorted in them continually lecturing me about the importance of education.
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Talent, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your parents and I am glad they are leading a wonderful family.

27/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Talent do you have any siblings please?

My eldest young sister is Natasha Nyoni and my youngest sister goes by the name Anashe Nyoni <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

It's a pleasure to know more about them please.
27/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Well Talent now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 765 7687: I perceive that studying abroad comes with quality education and internationally recognized degrees which promotes a better chance of employability through this I believe studying abroad is a life changing decision.

I think studying abroad does not limit my education only to theoretical and practical knowledge but also it grants an opportunity  for me as a student to evolve and learn more about the world surrounding me through socialisation with my fellow colleagues which come from a different background as mine . This will enable  me to be more culturally intelligent <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across, Talent!

In this case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I am mentally prepared for a life abroad
27/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Talent, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
27/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes some of my family members are aware of my plans to study abroad and they have promised to support my higher education
27/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I agree <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Both mentally and financially
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to your parents itself, Talent.
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Sorry for that
Yes my parents are aware of my plans to study abroad and they are willing to support my higher education mentally and financially
27/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please and I do understand.
27/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 765 7687: I am confident thank you but I am currently awaiting my a level results
27/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you
27/12/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I am aware of the same
27/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
27/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 765 7687: For my O level results I got 7As and 1C , I am yet going to collect my certificate from wanezi high I have not really got time to go and collect it because of the pressures which my A level examination where giving me . For my A level I did commercials as I have already articulated prior to our discussion .The subjects which I had been doing for my A level are Maths , Accounting, Economics and Business Studies.

What motivates me to study accounting is my dream and my desire to become a Chartered accountant and I find accounting very interesting
27/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However do you have the results from the online portal?
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Let me try to look for them
27/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
27/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

That's great and surely well thought off, Talent!

Did you ever happen to research about your desired course?
27/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Sorry Ms Harmehak for the delay I was looking for the results and I have found them
27/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 765 7687: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Received please
27/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: You can address the same.

27/12/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

What all did you learn?
27/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 765 7687: I have learnt that it's a demanding course and it's one of the difficult courses in the commercials department. I learnt that for one to be enrolled into that course he should have a strong background in accounting and mathematics. The course takes about 4 years in order for one to acquire a bachelor's degree in Accounting.
27/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

I am glad you thoroughly researched!
27/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: On that note, now let me brief you about your desired course -

27/12/23, 10:26 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

28/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 765 7687: Good morning Ms Harmehak, Mr Sahil and Mr jyotishman.
28/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 765 7687: We can start
28/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 765 7687: I hope you are all doing well and having a great day
28/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Yes please, thank you
28/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Alright Talent, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 765 7687: My pleasure
28/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 765 7687: By being provided this course in the next five years I see my self being employed as an accountant since I would have acquired a well recognized degree in Hon Bcomms this will then help me  in pursuing my dream of being a Chartered accountant. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: That is really great Talent, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 765 7687: I am a student who is dedicated and comes from a background which pushes me to thrive for better quality education and in my country I am hindered towards my aspirations because of higher costs of acquiring this quality education. Studying abroad in India ensures me of quality education which comes at a lower cost.

Studying abroad also minimises the chances of unemployment. This is because universities from abroad offer globally recognized degrees which promotes employability . A holder of an internationally recognized degree has an opportunity to work abroad in a well paying job unlike a holder of a degree which is not well recognized in the whole world.

Furthermore, I would like to study abroad because countries like India have got advanced technology therefore their education meets with the changing times and increasing penetration of the internet this promotes new age skills and experience unlike studying in my home country where we are technological behind.

Moreover, I am a student you likes to evolve . Learning in Zimbabwe will not enable me to evolve as I want to but learning in India will enable me to evolve and learn more about the world  which surrounds me through mingling with people who will be coming from a different culture as mine. This will enable me to be more culturally intelligent. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful and well put across, Talent, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure and looking for best education too.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

It's home to the world's third largest higher education system awerness with many universities and colleges
28/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 765 7687: The fact that the universities are well ranked I feel like this will enable me to achieve my dreams

28/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes when I researched about the cost structures of Indian university education fees they were ranging from $7000-$8000 per year <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I can see you have awareness!
28/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Let me add about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 765 7687: Duly noted and thank you for the information about the cost structures it really helped me a lot .
28/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 765 7687: Edoofa really helps a lot in making education affordable.
28/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement!
28/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 765 7687: My pleasure
28/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
28/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 765 7687: I think that's a really interesting and innovative approach to reducing cost of education. It's great that you are able to provide such a significant discount for students who perform well,  and the EWYL program sounds like a fantastic way to further reduce costs . It's clear that you are committed to helping students achieve their educational goals in an affordable way . I am really impressed by your model and think it's a fantastic idea
28/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following and you have clearly understood the important aspects of the discussion so far, Talent!
28/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Talent, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
28/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 765 7687: I agree to that it's true
28/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you
28/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

So comparing the same you would be in an even better place to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Talent?
28/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes
28/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
28/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

28/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you for enlightening more about the Edoofa scholarship program I see that it avails many opportunities
28/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
28/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes
28/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 765 7687: Wow persistence seems like a hard working guy he is now my inspiration
28/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Talent
28/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Talent, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay
28/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Please
28/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 765 7687: $1500
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: You see, Talent, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I really think so
28/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 765 7687: Wow this is remarkable
28/12/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/12/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
28/12/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 765 7687: Duly noted
28/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 765 7687: Duly noted
28/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you for the information
28/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I now understand it
28/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

28/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Okay
28/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Noted
28/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
28/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

28/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Talent!
28/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Okay I will Ms Harmehak thank you

28/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Okay
28/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 765 7687: May I ask 

So Ms Harmehak what is the estimate cost in total which is supposed to be paid for my first year in india
28/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: If you would be performing well in all the criterias, you can definitely score a scholarship between $1500-2000 a year,

Inclusive of your tuition fee, accomodation and basic university expenses.

The final quantum of scholarship will be shared during the admissions process as that is why you will receive acceptance letter from universities.
28/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Duly noted thank you
28/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Is there anything else please?
28/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 765 7687: No , all cleared thank you
28/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

29/12/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: While I have submitted the test for evaluation, 

I would like to discuss regarding the interview process with your parents, Talent!

Are they available?
29/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Yes there are available
29/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 243 3868: Good evening Ms Harmehak
29/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 243 3868: U can go ahead
29/12/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/12/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/12/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
29/12/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 243 3868: Yes I have been following the program and we have discussed about it . If my son gets accepted I will use this form of payment because of the reasons which you have articulated here
29/12/23, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023 for $200 and the  4th or 5th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
29/12/23, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please.

I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
03/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you very much Ms Harmehak
03/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: You're welcome Talent!

Do take some time to thoroughly go through the letter and inform me once done.
03/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 765 7687: I did not get the Email
03/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 765 7687: My email address is Chiyedzangwenya@gmail.com
03/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Let me check please!
03/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
03/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 765 7687: I have thoroughly gone through my acceptance letter
03/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Do you have any queries for me as we speak?
03/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 765 7687: No all cleared
03/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 765 7687: We are looking forward to make the payments
03/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
03/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: In that case, shall I first brief you about the payment modes?
03/01/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay Ms Harmehak
03/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
03/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
