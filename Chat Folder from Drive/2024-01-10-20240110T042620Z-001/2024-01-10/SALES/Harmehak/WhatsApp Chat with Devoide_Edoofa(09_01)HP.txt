I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St Francis and St Clare charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
09/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 659 3474: Greetings to you ladies and gentlemen, respected members present Ms .Harmehak Mr .Piyush, Mr jyotishman . First and foremost,my name is Devoide Mapendere I am a boy aged 22 . I was at St Francis and St Clare secondary school that is in Guruve, Mashonaland central which is in Zimbabwe. Further, I have completed my School at St Francis and st clare secondary which is U6 ( form 6 ) last year 2023 as am waiting for the results. In the same vein , at St Francis and St Clare I was a day schooler meaning to say I stay out of the compass. At St Francis and St Clare secondary I was paying 120 USD for school fees every term . More to it , I am a fun of commercials since I do pure mathematics, Economics, Business studies and I wish to study  Business Administration there in India. My hobbie is reading books. Again, about family my father is a farmer and my mother died when I was form 1 , My mother was deputy head mistress of Mvurwi primary school before she died and my father is a retired District Administrator (DA) of Mazowe.
09/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 659 3474: I have 1 little sister.
09/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss, Devoide.
09/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 659 3474: No problem, it is part of nature. That is all our way mam
09/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 659 3474: That is all enough right.
09/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 368 9885: Painful 😣
09/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
09/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
09/01/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Devoide, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
09/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 659 3474: Thank you
09/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 71 368 9885: How many points do you need just for a student
09/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Well Devoide, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 71 368 9885: That's is true and I do understand.
09/01/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 659 3474: Of course it is a life changing decision
09/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
09/01/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright in that case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/01/24, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
