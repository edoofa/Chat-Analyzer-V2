I am Mr Keshav , Career Counsellor at Edoofa

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend tatenda and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
09/01/24, 3:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa changed the group name from "_Edoofa(09/01)KG" to "Claire_Edoofa(09/01)KG"
09/01/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Yes
09/01/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Claire,

You can address me as Mr Keshav, and we do have Mr Piyush, Head of Counselling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/01/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from tatenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about tatenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I am aware that it's a scholarship program providing opportunities in India
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: This is great
09/01/24, 3:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Claire, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

2. Parent’s Participation in the Process- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes Sir
09/01/24, 3:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Claire, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

09/01/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

I am just fond of Computers and I am also interested in physics and mathematics.
09/01/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very Well Claire, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
