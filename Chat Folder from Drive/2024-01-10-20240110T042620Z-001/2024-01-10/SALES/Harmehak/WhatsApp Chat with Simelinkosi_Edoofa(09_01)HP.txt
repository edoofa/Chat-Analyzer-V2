09/01/24, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

09/01/24, 8:13 pm - +263 78 835 2122: -i learnt that Edoofa is full of hospitality as they come to accept a leaner from the airport ensuring that they arrived safely and they are setting in well. I also learnt that it's a program that helps African students get tertiary education. It also offers good mentors that get you through out the journey from application till you're done. I also learnt that there is a program called earn while you learn where one is given different projects that offer a chance to earn scholarship credits that lessen the financial burden of paying fees
