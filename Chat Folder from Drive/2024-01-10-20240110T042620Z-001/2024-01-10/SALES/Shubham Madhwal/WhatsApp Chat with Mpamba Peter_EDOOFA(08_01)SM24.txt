08/01/24, 1:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 324 7685: Wow, that is a lot of information and it's impressive to see the scope of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I can tell that it is a well-respected program, and it's amazing to hear that so many students have been able to benefit from it. I can imagine that the competition is tough, but I am determined to do my best to stand out and be considered for this opportunity. I really appreciate the fact that the program focuses on employability as well, as that is an important factor in any educational experience. I'm ready to learn more.
08/01/24, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 324 7685: That is a really amazing initiative and it's incredible to hear that Edoofa is doing so much to help students succeed. I think it's really special that you're not only focused on making education affordable, but also giving students the tools they need to be successful. The SEELS program sounds like a wonderful way to empower students and help them achieve their goals. I'm so glad that I applied for this opportunity! Can you tell me more about the Edoofa Student Platform?
