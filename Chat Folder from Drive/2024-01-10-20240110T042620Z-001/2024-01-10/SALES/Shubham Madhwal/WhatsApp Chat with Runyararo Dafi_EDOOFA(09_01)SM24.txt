09/01/24, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Munyaradzi?*
09/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 717 1803: 1)  I got to know about Edoofa through one of my Teachers.  The teacher understands my situation, my financial situation and my capabilities at school.  So he urged me to apply and be an Edoofian.   I want to be an Engineer (Aeronautical or Mechanical) and wish to reach the best in that field.  From the Testimonies I was listening to by the Edoofians already in the system I believe Edoofa can also help me to achieve my dreams by giving me the chance to enrol in some of the best universities.
2) My basic understanding is that Edoofa can help you to achieve your life dreams.  If you have passion and drive to work hard, with Edoofa the sky is the limit.
09/01/24, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

So are we good to begin your session?
09/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 717 1803: Yes we can begin.
09/01/24, 11:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/01/24, 11:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
09/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 717 1803: Thank you very much for the detailed information about Edoofa.  I really look forward to be part of the 5000 scholarship seats.
09/01/24, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/01/24, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 717 1803: I am very happy to note that we have Edoofians from my province, Manicaland.  St David's Bonda, Hartzell High School, Nyazura High, Chibuwe High Andrew my school St Faiths High are amongst the best in the province in terms of performance.  Such schools are Christian schools that have discipline that fosters good results.   That makes me confident that I can be part of Edoofa.
09/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 717 1803: , Chibuwe High *and* my school . . .  (correction)
09/01/24, 12:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Dafi
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
09/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 717 1803: As parents we are excited to have our son linked with Edoofa and pray that he will succeed in getting the scholarship.  I am his father with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Studies.  I used to manage well established companies, but unfortunately our economy took a downturn that led to the closure of many companies.  During our time at University the thrust was on strategic management and companies that needed muanagers of that calibre were many.  Now, with the Land reform process the economic structure changed.  Commercial farms that were the backbone of the agricultural sector were disabled.  Commercial Farmers left and the farms were subdivided into smaller portions and distributed to the locals.  This had an adverse effect on the industry performance.  The economy became informal.  I lost my job and got into the informally sector, in my case farming projects such as piggery, poultry etc.  I had hoped that we could access bank loans but this did not work out. The banking sector is struggling; we are a major risk to them.  Yes we are trudging in but unfortunately will not be able to make our son realise his dreams.  And this is where our joy came when we got to know about Edoofa.  We are confident of our son's performance; but we are handicapped financially.  My wife is a tailor but again this will not enable us to take our son to University.  What really motivates me to support our son to study abroad is the quality, focus and exposure that comes with studying abroad.  The world is now a global village and interaction at that level is extremely good for our son.  He will also increase his chances of employment outside Zimbabwe and ultimately help his family back home and his country as well.
09/01/24, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr and Mrs Dafi*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Runyararo*, right?
09/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 717 1803: Surely, you have summarised it.  Thank you very much.
09/01/24, 1:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Runyararo*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A-level/Grade-12?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
09/01/24, 4:37 pm - +263 77 717 1803: My name is Runyararo Dafi, aged 18 years.  I am the first born in a family of five (4 boys and 1 girl).  One of my brothers is waiting for his O Level results.  My twin brothers are in Grade 7, and my sister, Grade 2.  We have a plot where my parents do farming projects; my mother is a tailor.  My father has a Business Studies degree and my mother has an O Level certificate.  I did my O Level and A Level at St Faiths High school, Rusape, Manicaland.  I was a day scholar.  My parents were paying my school fees, average $200 per Term.  I passed my O Level with 12As and 2Bs.  I am Currently waiting for my A Level results.  I wrote 5 subjects:.
