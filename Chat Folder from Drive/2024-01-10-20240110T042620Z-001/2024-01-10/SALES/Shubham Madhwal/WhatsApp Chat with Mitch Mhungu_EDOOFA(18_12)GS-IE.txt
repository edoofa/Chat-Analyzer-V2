20/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 825 3372: How are you sir sorry for the inconvenience
20/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 825 3372: I am now available today and onwards, I had some minor setbacks
20/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mitch, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, is that correct?
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes it is
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, also do tell me whether you learnt about Valerie’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Honestly I haven't learnt much about the Edoofa program except that it offers scholarships , however she did mention that her journey was and still is enjoyable. India offers languages which include English
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Valerie who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship  as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes she did introduce me to the parameters.
20/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well she did give me an example of a 60 percent scholarship and the student has to pay 40 percent on other expenses
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Along with examination fees
20/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 825 3372: However I would prefer a 100% scholarship.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mitch, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Noted sir
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 825 3372: No, I do not have any limitations .

21/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 825 3372: 1. I have currently completed my A level and I am waiting for my results,  however I have 11 O levels passes with 6 As and 5 Bs .

21/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
21/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
21/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 825 3372: The Headmaster is Mr B Ncube , you get a hold of him on 077 226 0948
21/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Data science, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
21/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well I have found performing the same task over and over again cumbersome and boring hence discouraging . Hence I search for the best field of study that is not repetitive and goes hand in hand with the passion I have for particular subjects of study such as Economics and Statistics . Data science is complex in  nature and has no particular definition really,  however it can simply be put as the study of information or data to bring out certain results.  This said I find it interesting as data or information  collected  is quite broad and meeting the same exact information is very low hence it can bring out the best in me. Furthermore Data science requires teamwork which I am quite fond of as I played team sports like basketball during High school,  also it requires critical thinking which is my strong suit as I am a chess nationalist.
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to pursue data science is driven by a combination of factors that resonate with the field's complexity, diversity, and the alignment of your skills and interests.
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 212 7223: Should Mitch pursue this particular field of study he will be the first.
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Unfortunately sir I do not have a hold of them as we speak,  I would appreciate it if I can be able to send them tomorrow morning.  I am sorry for the inconvenience.
21/12/23, 7:40 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/12/23, 8:10 am - +263 77 274 2387: Good morning
23/12/23, 8:18 am - +263 78 825 3372: Good morning
23/12/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: No Mitch, this is the best option based on upon your A-level subjects.
23/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 825 3372: Okay thank you very much
23/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
23/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I did
23/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I do
23/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 825 3372: There are several benefits to a bachelor of commerce degree. Firstly, it opens up a wide range of career options, as it is  a versatile and well-respected degree. Secondly, it will  develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and financial literacy, which are all valuable in data science and any industry. Finally, it provides a solid foundation for further study in the commerce field, such as a master's degree or a professional qualification. All in all, it's a great way to build a strong and successful career. Furthermore with the course , it will  provide me with the valuable information that can help me gain financial stability and understanding in order to achieve my dream of pursuing data science.  Hence if I would get into Edoofa's Program I feel I would be an independent individual with a strong knowledge in finance giving me a myriad of career options such as business analytics , marketing and more . Hence after 5 years I see myself able to pursue further advanced Data Science studies and being an able independent person to  venture into any career I may wish to inorder to finance further  my education and my family.
23/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Mitch I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I am willing to give 300 % hard work
23/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Thank you very much

23/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well I  believe universities abroad have more recognition in the global village and I wish to be more marketable when  I am done with my studies.  Also with the help of a scholarship it becomes much cheaper to study abroad as the country's economy is declining gradually and inflation is  increasing. <This message was edited>

*“The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
26/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 274 2387: Good morning, noted with thanks
26/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 825 3372: Good morning
26/12/23, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
26/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 825 3372: Well yes , although I may not be an educational teacher,  I believe I can make impact in the educational system of my country and definitely in my other ways.
26/12/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mitch, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I agree
26/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
26/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes , why does Edoofa recommend India?
26/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
26/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

26/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mitch, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Honestly no
26/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 825 3372: No we are not familiar with the costs
26/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

26/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mitch what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 825 3372: I understand about the reduction in cost of education in India due to the help from Edoofa,  however I would like to learn more about the earn while you learn program
26/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Mitch, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 825 3372: That's interesting, and thank you I understand
26/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

26/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 825 3372: I think this will greatly benefit me
26/12/23, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mitch, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 825 3372: That's quite the benefit
26/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 274 2387: Thank you so much for this information, l am also learning
26/12/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
26/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Thank you very much I have been enlightened
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mitch, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
26/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes they will support me
26/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
26/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes we have talked it through
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 274 2387: Yes Sir, we have discussed and have been following closely in this group. I appreciate 👏🏼
26/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I am
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Mitch as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 825 3372: They spend from $1500 to $2250
26/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mitch, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Oh I get it
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 825 3372: I definitely agree
26/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Please do
26/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Mitch basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Thank you for the information,  I feel it's straight forward.
26/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 825 3372: No I am not
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mitch, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes I understand the process
26/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
26/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
26/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 825 3372: No everything has been explained on my part
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

27/12/23, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Please, the accommodation facility can be availed affordabily at the University itself and the it is included in the total cost range of education, that is $1500-$2300.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
28/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 274 2387: 1 . Bachelor of Commerce (B.com) is what you recommend for Mitch as a stepping stone to captivating world of Data science or Data analysis which was his first choice.

7. Understood, thank you
28/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: *@263772742387*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

TOPIC : What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there ?

The 1994 Rwanda genocide was one of the most horrific events in modern history . In the span of just hundred days,  more than eight hundred thousand people were killed , mostly Tutsis , but also moderate Hutus and others . This tragedy left a deep and lasting scar on the nation of Rwanda,  but in the last sixteen years since the genocide,  there have been significant efforts to rebuild and heal . Rwanda today is  a country that is still struggling to recover from the legacy of the genocide.  The scars of that violence are still visible, but there are also signs of hope and progress. One of the most difficult issues is that of justice and reconciliation. Many perpetrators of the genocide have not been brought to justice,  and this has caused tension and unrest in some communities. In  addition,  there are still deep divisions between Hutus and Tutsis , and this has made it difficult to move forward as a nation. However,  there have also been positive steps taken to address these challenges. The Rwandan government has established a number of programs and initiatives aimed at reconciliation and rebuilding. One of the most important of these is the Gacaca courts,  a traditional system of justice that has been adapted to address the crimes of the genocide.  These courts have helped to provide some measures of justice for victims and families,  and have also played a role in healing the wounds of the past . In addition there have been efforts to promote economic development and improve living standards,  which have helped to create more hopeful future for the country. Another key factor in the rebuilding of Rwanda has been the role of women.  Women were disproportionately affected by the genocide , and many were left widowed and without a means of support . However,  women have also been at the forefront of efforts to rebuild the country. They have taken on leadership roles in government and civil society,  and have been instrumental in promoting peace and  reconciliation . For example,  the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission which is charged with promoting reconciliation and healing,  is headed by a woman. In summary,the last sixteen years have been a time of both hardship and hope for Rwanda. The country has made significant progress in rebuilding and healing, but it still faces many challenges.  However there is reason to be optimistic about the future. With continued efforts and commitment, Rwanda can continue to move forward and become a model of peace and reconciliation  for the world. 

Section 6 

Eighteen year old Mitch Mhungu is eagerly awaiting his A level results.  He has always been interested in the world of commerce,  and is considering pursuing a degree in Data Science. This has been due to the fact that  the field of study is complex , diversified and is  aligned  with his  skills and interests. Furthermore,  Mitch is excited about the opportunity that this field has to offer , but also a little nervous about what the future holds . From a young age I had wished to find a compelling career that would challenge me. In pursuit of such a career I found Data Science the best option as it aligned with my love for basketball , chess and the commercials field of study. This academic field along with these extra curricula activities gave rise to the desire I have to pursue Data Science. Along the way I faced many challenges that include passing my grade seven  and O level examinations  in order to get enrolled by the best High schools in the country,  moreover I have been under pressure as being the first born of my family to set a good example for my siblings. I have  worked hard to be where I am, even under the difficult circumstances which we all faced namely the pandemic that disturbed the globe ( Covid 19 ) . Writing my O level was a struggle due to the deadly pandemic having lost a year and a half of education,  I still went ahead and wrote my O level , having to endure countless  sleepless  nights to get to scratch,  at the end of it I passed . With this in mind, along with the desire to help my family I went ahead to pursue my A level qualifications. Along the way  I  also pursued my extra curricula activities reaching provisional level in my basketball competition and National level in my chess tournaments . However through these hardships and challenges I was always inspired to keep working hard by my parents. Without ever getting anything for free, I learnt to work hard for my dreams meaning I had to put extra effort in my basketball training sessions,  chess practices and even more effort in my studies. Bearing this in mind I intend to continue working hard in pursuit of by dream career as I have done so , hence I cannot stand the thought of giving up on it since I have worked for it. Also knowing that having qualifications in Zimbabwe does not guarantee employment I seek to have internationally recognized inorder to be a better option . In a nutshell my passion for Data Science is inspired by the field's complexity,  possibly career paths I can choose from and my own traits and skills which I have acquire. Also with the burning desire to set a good example for my siblings,  backed with the unwavering support of my parents.
