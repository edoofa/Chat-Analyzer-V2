29/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Greetings, Mr Francis and Eliza
I welcome you to this session

*I am Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*


We have received the application of Agness for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application.
29/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Mrs Joylet, are you available?
29/12/23, 2:41 pm - +265 883 33 11 11: Have you received application??
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - +265 883 33 11 11: As of now Agnes she is preparing for exams I thought this scholarship is based on the MSCE results?? So why now??
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - +265 883 33 11 11: I think its too early
29/12/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Malawian students receive the results late just during the time of intake compared to Western African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year itself. So we evaluate the term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 3 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
29/12/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: 2: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

02/01/24, 4:09 pm - Kunal: I want to emphasize the significance of this counseling session, specifically designed for both parents and students. Higher education is a substantial decision, and the collaborative involvement of parents is pivotal in shaping a significant impact on your child's future. Asking about the parents' participation is essential as it allows us to understand your perspectives better, fostering a more informed and supportive environment for your child's application. I firmly believe that parents' active participation in the decision-making process significantly contributes to the holistic development and success of their child's educational journey, don't you?
02/01/24, 4:12 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: I leave my school in form 4

Shall we proceed?
09/01/24, 11:53 am - Kunal: Good morning
I am expecting to hear from you 
May I know if you are available for the session? <This message was edited>
09/01/24, 1:42 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: Yes
09/01/24, 1:49 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
09/01/24, 1:50 pm - Kunal: Well noted
Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE.
09/01/24, 2:00 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 2:04 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: The last term results of my dota end we are sure that  she will pass Maneb exams with good grades
09/01/24, 2:15 pm - Kunal: As you mentioned that it is her desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible. At the same time, I do acknowledge her strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which she is eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*4) Bachelor of Optometry*
*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
09/01/24, 2:20 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: Ok maybe she will take one of these  no ploblem
09/01/24, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Alright, may I know which course do you wish me to explain?
09/01/24, 2:27 pm - +265 992 18 31 01: Number 1 maybe she can like it
09/01/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
