1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

15/12/23, 3:13 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Thank you so much for the opportunity. I can only hope for the best of my brother's chances of obtaining such scholarships and for all fellow Africans students.
15/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: I completely understand
So, have you decided with which course do you wish to proceed with?
15/12/23, 3:23 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Number  5: Bachelor of science in cardiovascular technology.
15/12/23, 3:41 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
As we've thoroughly covered your course details, and since you are aware Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
15/12/23, 3:44 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I am, and it is way above our shoulders.
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:06 pm - +27 78 760 0842: It is not affordable as such, but at least we can try and manage.
15/12/23, 4:06 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
15/12/23, 4:09 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I come cross on the documents.
15/12/23, 4:12 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 4:12 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 4:12 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
15/12/23, 4:18 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, it is totally beneficial.
15/12/23, 4:18 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/12/23, 4:20 pm - +27 78 760 0842: This is a win-win situation.
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
15/12/23, 4:26 pm - +27 78 760 0842: It is difficult to choose but number 3.
15/12/23, 4:30 pm - +27 78 760 0842: As it provides experience in both life and working industries.
15/12/23, 4:37 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

15/12/23, 4:37 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Davie with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/12/23, 4:44 pm - +27 78 760 0842: I will be responsible for the reminder of the fees as his order, brother.
15/12/23, 4:45 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
15/12/23, 4:45 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - +27 78 760 0842: For me, this is the first time, and I have no idea of the requirements.
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that these are required
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/12/23, 4:51 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:55 pm - +27 78 760 0842: That's manageable. Big thank you to edoofa.
15/12/23, 4:56 pm - Kunal: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/12/23, 4:56 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
15/12/23, 4:56 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/12/23, 4:57 pm - +27 78 760 0842: I am with you
15/12/23, 4:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 5:18 pm - +27 78 760 0842: I think we have discussed upto points 6.
15/12/23, 5:18 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
15/12/23, 5:19 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes please
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
15/12/23, 5:23 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I am.
15/12/23, 5:45 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
15/12/23, 5:45 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

16/12/23, 11:36 am - Austin: Greetings Mr Albert, Mrs Melina and Davie,

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Mr Kunal and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
16/12/23, 11:39 am - +27 78 760 0842: Warm greetings to you, sir. Davie is still at school, and I will be standing his shoe's, my name is Harrison nyanja, his older brother.
16/12/23, 11:41 am - +27 78 065 4707: Greetings to you too  mr Austin. 

Yes  i am although here and I will be busy but I will keep checking your messages and  Albert
16/12/23, 11:48 am - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mr Albet and Mr Harrison

I hope you are doing well
16/12/23, 11:48 am - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
16/12/23, 11:53 am - +27 78 760 0842: Edoofa's agenda is purely on building Africa at large and creating working space for Africans as  they are giving education to most  poor young Africans.
16/12/23, 12:00 pm - +27 78 760 0842: However My concern is how these scholarships is determined from 50%-100% and if someone gets 100%scholarships, how much would a family plan annually?
16/12/23, 12:14 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your brother's career!
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Austin: With an exemplary performance in the upcoming process and academics, if a student can secure a 100% on tuition fees, the costs would be lesser than $2000 per annum, on an average, it would be within $1200-$1800 per annum which can be further reduced through the Earn While you Learn Program
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Wonderful, it is really exciting experience to learn outside and I believe it always generosity of other people to help those in need and on that edoofa is proving worthy to Africans.
16/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 78 760 0842: How guarantees are there that after studying in India these students maybe employed?and do edoofa help on searching jobs for them?
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - Austin: I'm glad you find the opportunity exciting!
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - Austin: We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
16/12/23, 12:32 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Wonderful
16/12/23, 12:36 pm - +27 78 760 0842: I personally think that is really excellent for those who want to go further with their studies and I only hope for my brother.
16/12/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: That is right, Mr Harrison!
16/12/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 12:44 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Wow, is this for real.
16/12/23, 12:45 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Thank you and thank you once again.
16/12/23, 12:51 pm - Austin: You are welcome!
16/12/23, 12:51 pm - Austin: May I know the thoughts of you and your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
16/12/23, 1:09 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Once again let me begin by thanking you, sir, for the opportunity, it is a lifetime opportunity. In terms financially we are very poor but I am going to work my socks off in order to provide some cost of his education.
16/12/23, 1:19 pm - Austin: I really understand the challenges and appreciate your willingness to support Davie despite them
16/12/23, 1:36 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Thank you
16/12/23, 1:39 pm - Austin: You are welcome
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - Austin: By when will Davie be available?
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - +27 78 760 0842: He will be available from 23 December.
16/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 78 760 0842: They are closing school first term on 22 December 2023 and then we expect him to be home on the 23.
16/12/23, 1:48 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
16/12/23, 1:48 pm - Austin: Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Daniel would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
16/12/23, 1:59 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Davie will be studying bachelor of science in cardiovascular technology. He will be studying in  India .
16/12/23, 2:01 pm - +27 78 760 0842: The average costs without scholarship in India is  about 6000 to 8000 us dollars while through edoofa scholarship is about 2000 to 3000 us dollars.
16/12/23, 2:07 pm - +27 78 760 0842: How much would be the registration fee and when actually would it be needed?
16/12/23, 2:19 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
16/12/23, 2:22 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Alright. Thank you. Just to be sure, Davies intake is one of those of 2025. I need to have a proper plan for him.
16/12/23, 3:02 pm - Austin: Indeed, the intake of Davie is in 2025 itself and the intake is already open
16/12/23, 3:02 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
16/12/23, 3:11 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Alright. Thank you so much.
16/12/23, 3:35 pm - Austin: You are most welcome
16/12/23, 3:38 pm - Austin: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exams due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Malawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you or the parents willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Davie?*
16/12/23, 3:48 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes.
16/12/23, 4:03 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness, Mr Harrison!
16/12/23, 4:04 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 4:04 pm - Austin: Dear parents @265886760486 @27780654707 @27787600842 ,Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Let me know if you have any challenges.
16/12/23, 4:18 pm - +27 78 760 0842: All will be standing on my shoulders as our father (Daniso)left us for good 2017 on 17 December(died).
16/12/23, 4:21 pm - +27 78 760 0842: We are going to discuss as a family, but I am pretty that I will be ready to meet the required deadlines if my brother found eligible.

20/12/23, 11:32 am - Austin: Noted, since you are  in South Africa, there is a cheaper mode of transaction through Mama Money, are you familiar with the mode?
20/12/23, 11:33 am - +27 78 760 0842: No, how does it work.
20/12/23, 11:45 am - Austin: Mama money is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops. 

There are two options for the same, 1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees.

20/12/23, 12:12 pm - Austin: That is correct
20/12/23, 12:13 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Alright,  thank you so much
20/12/23, 12:26 pm - Austin: You are most welcome
20/12/23, 12:26 pm - Austin: Is there anything you would like to ask me as of now?
20/12/23, 12:30 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Maybe interms the name of  college or university where is he going to study. Any idea as of now?
