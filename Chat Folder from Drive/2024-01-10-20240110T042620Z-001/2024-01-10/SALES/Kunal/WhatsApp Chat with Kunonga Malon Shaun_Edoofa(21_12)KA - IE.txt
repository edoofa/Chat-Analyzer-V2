I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

22/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 703 3674: Mr Kunal sir ,some of the degrees you are opting that l take are of little significance here in Zimbabwe,some of them are valuable there in India but not in Zimbabwe,due to the differnces in our economies .Both India and Zimbabwe are developing nations but at different levels of growth and development making some degrees useful in another country and not of much importance in another.With such a degree l cant get employment here in Zimbabwe but if l was in India l would  get employment .That's why l asked for a degree in agricultural economics, l can get  both  employment and be an entrepreneur. In short ,may you give me either bachelor of science Honors in  agricultural economics, bachelor of commerce Honors  in economics or bachelor of science honors in agribusiness .If you can not ,it is ok.I thank you for your time and consideration.
22/12/23, 11:46 am - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 12:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

26/12/23, 11:25 am - Kunal: I also understand that you are referring to courses that are offered in Zimbabwean universities and based on their curriculum but you need to understand that the curriculum carries across nations and the syllabus that is covered it also different from that of Zimbabwe.
For example, a Bachelor of Commerce in Economics might be offering you a specialization in Zimbabwe but when you look at India, Economics is already included in the course and there are courses like Bachelor of Business Administration will include Economics, Marketing, etc. which are well aligned with your career goals 
Therefore, you will have to understand that being your Career counselor I am looking at your employability not just in Zimbabwe or India but internationally which means you can work anywhere in the globe. Even when you look forward to working in Zimbabwe you will be considered and valued because your curriculum includes all these aspects that you require 
I am looking at opportunities that will be there after 3 years while you are looking at the opportunities that exist now
26/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 703 3674: so,you are suggesting that l take business administration or Bcomm in economics
26/12/23, 11:30 am - Kunal: Yes Malon
In my suggestion, *Bachelor of Business Administration* will be the perfect fit for you
26/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 703 3674: ok sir ,l will take it. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
26/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 703 3674: Edoofa has since guided me through to the right choice of program and will obviously be handy in easing the financial side of funding the course. Again, the location of the targeted university will give me quite some experience l never imagined, like exposure to diverse cultural and economic experiences.
After successful completion of the course, l will come back and make use of the knowledge to participate in the planning and growth of Zimbabwe's economy.  l also will have an opportunity to join in enterprenurship and contribute by starting projects and  businesses.l see my self as a project manager in an upcoming IT company since lm also into information technology.l am also looking forward to pursuing a masters degree in business administration soon after gaining some working experience. Being a fellow edoofian will aid in achieving my career goals as l would have an advantage of being from a widely recognised organisation which makes it easier to get employment in world class companies which may aid in me reaching my self actualisation point.
26/12/23, 11:58 am - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
26/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 703 3674: Indias education system  has undergone some changes over the years. It is currently divided into four levels which are  primary , upper primary  , secondary , and higher secondary  . The system seems to be centralised as the government sets the curriculum and sets the examinations.  one of the greatest strengths of the system is its ability to provide quality education to a large number of students as it has around  1.5 million schools. The system also has a strong emphasis on  learning and standardized testing.It has also bred some  of the world's greatest CEOs as you have mentioned above.

26/12/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
26/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 703 3674: With Indias robust education system l am sure that l will be a developed young man who can tackle all kinds of situations in the working environment.As well as managing my own businesses as l am planning on being an entrepreneur.The economy of India is well ahead of Zimbabwe's, and we have got quite much to learn from India.  There are a lot of inventions and various  other contributions that the world credits to India that makes it competitive on the educational market. I have, thus, no doubt that just visiting India enhances and equips one's knowledge base, let alone getting educated there.l aim to achieve my career aspirations by studying at a top ranked university as well as gaining experience from doing voluntary work and networking  with professionals in my line of study.My employability is enhanced by merely studying there. It will also enhance my networking with other scholars and businesses people.
26/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 703 3674: Verifiable facts about India, like indicated above, are testimony enough to convince all that it is a nation of great minds, and I wouldn’t in any way doubt its educational system.
26/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
26/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 703 3674: Russia ranges from 6 to 7 thousand ,but l am not sure about the quality of education.
26/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
26/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 703 3674: understood sir.
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on
*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
26/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 703 3674: yes l believe so as this programmes get the student ready for the real world .Some of the opportunities mention above are as good as Internships which grow the student hence the student will be industry ready before graduating.More so the student will be also earning credits to cover the remaining tuition hence no more financial burden.In short ,the EWYL programme is quite beneficial.
26/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 703 3674: ok sir ,l understand.l can't wait .
26/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
26/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
26/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
26/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 703 3674: Point number 3 ,I value experience. One gets experience from the earn while you learn programme as well as credits which can be used to pay fees and other expenses. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.
26/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 703 3674: OK.

26/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
26/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 703 3674: Both my parents will be helping with the remaining fee.
26/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 703 3674: They are quite happy.Especially with the fact that l get to explore and get quality education.
26/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
26/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
26/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 703 3674: 1.Passport 
2.police clearance form 
3.Visa 
4.Recommendation letter  from former school
4.Application form
26/12/23, 1:38 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
26/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 703 3674: noted sir.
26/12/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
26/12/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
26/12/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 703 3674: noted sir.
26/12/23, 1:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 703 3674: stage 2
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 703 3674: yes
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.

03/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 703 3674: when Is  the registration fee due?
03/01/24, 1:34 pm - Austin: The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600. After your enrollment, our Admissions Team will be guiding you through University sessions where the tentative dates and payment plans will be first discussed with your family to reduce the financial challenges.
