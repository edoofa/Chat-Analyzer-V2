It's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:
1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with Lorraine?
09/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 71 669 8958: 1. I was inspired by some of the students who applied there and Lorraine my friend as well. When she applied on the program I was not sure if it was going to work but now that she is studying there that's when she told me the benefits of the Edoofa such as doing other programs and earning as well as having mentors that assist you. When I was talking to her yesterday she told me that she had an industrial visit which is another benefit as well. Therefore this inspired me to apply for the program looking forward to learn and benefit from the program.
09/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 669 8958: 2. I understood that the program offer you the scholarship depending on your results.
