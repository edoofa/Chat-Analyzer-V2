09/01/24, 9:23 pm - +263 78 131 1116: what inspired me to go through with this is that it is affordable. It offers 50-100% scholarship depending on the likes of grades etc. 
As per discussions with Wesley the program is quite nice. I heard there's this other program which about Earn While You Learn which gives one the opportunity to earn money per month throughout the course. This helps one to complete their education at less the price.
