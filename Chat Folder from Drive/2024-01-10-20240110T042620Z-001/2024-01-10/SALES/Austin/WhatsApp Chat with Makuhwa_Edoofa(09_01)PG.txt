09/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 776 7673: Iam a confident and determined individual who is always eager to learn and grow. I possess strong communication skills, allowing me to effectively express my thoughts and ideas. I am also highly organized and detail-oriented, which helps me stay on top of my tasks and responsibilities.One of my strengths is my ability to work well in a team. I enjoy collaborating with others, listening to different perspectives, and contributing my own ideas. This allows me to not only learn from my peers but also foster a positive and inclusive environment.Another strength of mine is my adaptability. I am open to new challenges and embrace change with a positive attitude. This allows me to quickly adjust to new situations and make the most out of them.However, like everyone, I also have weaknesses. One weakness I have identified is my tendency to be a perfectionist. While it pushes me to strive for excellence, it can sometimes lead to unnecessary stress and self-criticism. I am actively working on finding a balance between striving for perfection and accepting that mistakes are a part of the learning process. Reading is one of my hobbies 
Being the first born in my family introduced me to a lot of challenging things but it helped me grown more and be more responsible
09/01/24, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Geraldine, Thank you for sharing your strengths and areas for growth. Your confidence, determination, and adaptability are commendable traits. The awareness of perfectionism is a valuable self-reflection, and your commitment to finding balance is admirable. Being the first-born and navigating challenges has undoubtedly shaped your resilience and sense of responsibility. It's great to learn more about your qualities and experiences.

09/01/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/01/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/01/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 776 7673: Understood
09/01/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
09/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 776 7673: Not quite
09/01/24, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 776 7673: I have gone through  the article
09/01/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
09/01/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know if you were interested in Computer Engineering so, why haven't you pursued Physics and mathematics in A level?
09/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 776 7673: I wanted to create a broader choice of programs for university courses
09/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 776 7673: I understand
09/01/24, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Gerladine, After careful consideration of your subject combination and the absence of physics in your A-levels, pursuing BTech CSE may not be the most feasible option. However, given your evident passion for computers, I strongly recommend considering a course that perfectly aligns with your aspirations—*B.Sc. Computer Science (BSc CS)*. This choice not only caters to your interests but also promises a rewarding academic journey.

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
09/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 776 7673: Yes please
09/01/24, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Sc.
