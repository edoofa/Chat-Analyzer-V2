In grade 9,I passed my exams with  509, I was accepted back to my previous school and was put in a pure science class.

I was a member of badminton and debate club. I was the president of my debate club.
I am a very good leader,  I love learning new skills to develop myself and I enjoy meeting new people. 
My  parents both went to school but ended in grade 12.
I come from a broken family, my father is unemployed and my mother is mentally sick. I was taken in by my widowed aunt  with four daughters who raised me.
Therefore I do not want to end up like my parents.  I want to work hard and do better. Because I know with good education there are a lot of opportunities for employment. Both formal and informal.
05/01/24, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about your situation, Antoinette. I hope God will provide you with the strength to fight through adversity.

Apart from my daughter's I have raised 3 other daughters namely Antoinette here and two other girls for my sister. I have seen that education is a great equalizer as am the bread winner in my family. I promised myself to support my siblings children when I saw they could not. I can proudly say that as at today all the girls have completed grade 12. This is how I have supported Antoinette so that she gains economic independence for her future wellbeing.
