24/11/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the above information, be transparent and active throughout the counseling session and Evaluation
 
So shall we start the session?
24/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 298 9303: Yes please.
24/11/23, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
24/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 298 9303: I am a Social worker by profession. With a Bsc in Social Work and a Masters in International Relations. 
I have 2 children with Tafara being the youngest. My husband is an Electrical engineer
I believe that the right and quality education positions any child as competitive in future. Professional competence is founded upon a strong educational foundation. Hence my motivation to support my son ahead for education and for any cutting edge opportunities in further education.
24/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 298 9303: My son is a promising student. Very focused, determined and hard working. He has always been driven by motivation and ambition. 
I have observed that he does not back up from a challenge, he is innovative and strong willed. I have also observed that he hates confrontation and if he feels like someone is being confrontational he either tells them what they want to hear or completely ignore. I have also observed that he performs better under pressure, like when things have tight deadlines he pushes through and this then leads to this noticeable weakness of maybe relaxing if deadlines are relaxed. 
As a person my son is very caring, looks out for his sister, parents, cousins and anyone whom he holds dear. Most importantly I have noticed since he was in primary, he respects school protocols and does not want to be involved in things that could land him in trouble with teachers and authority. It is very rare to find a boy who wouldn't want to smuggle tinned foods or noodles as part of his school tuck, but Tafara has always been like that, if it's not allowed then he won't carry it to school. As he became a teenager I have always been on the look out for peer driven deviance, but Tafara is yet to dissapoint me. I know right now I am speaking as his mother and I am a proud one for that matter.
24/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: As a dedicated social worker with a BSc in Social Work and a Masters in International Relations, your commitment to making a positive impact on society is truly commendable. Juggling a successful career with raising two children, Tafara being the youngest, showcases your exceptional ability to balance multiple responsibilities. Mr. Admire's role as an Electrical Engineer adds a dynamic perspective to your family. What stands out is your unwavering belief in the transformative power of quality education, underscoring your forward-thinking approach. Your journey as a social worker, mother, and partner reflects a harmonious blend of professional accomplishment and personal fulfillment, making you a positive force shaping the future, Mrs. Charity!
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. Tafara is a beacon of promise, showcasing exceptional qualities of focus, determination, and hard work. His innovative spirit, coupled with a caring nature and unwavering respect for authority, makes him not only an outstanding student but also a source of pride for discerning and proud parents! I have confidence that Tafara is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance!
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Thank you
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 298 9303: You have said it so well. Thank you
24/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of Tafara's sibling?
24/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 298 9303: His sister went up to Advanced Level. When she was about to go to college for a marketing course Covid happened and everything was disrupted. So instead she got employment as a marketing person in the industry of farming implements and spares. She went on to get a class 2 driver's license and now she is working towards a marketing HND
24/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 298 9303: What does this offer entail.? What's in the package
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for being articulate, Mrs. Charity! Your co-operation is highly appreciated!

24/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Can you please give more details about the scholarship program. What is in it for the student, which universities, which programs does it support, for how long??? Any detail so that we get to the same wavelength
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. May I know whether you are connected with Abigail's parents, please?
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 298 9303: What's Abigail's full name
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. Abigail's full name is *Abigail Bidi* and she is currently studying with us in India, please.
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 298 9303: It's my first time hearing about her name. However I have heard from community connections that there is a program for Zimbabwean children in India. And I know a parent whose child went to India this year. But I do not know the Bidi family
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 298 9303: . At the same time my children have their own circle of associates which I may not know

28/11/23, 10:57 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through these messages, please.
28/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 298 9303: I have been going through the messages yes, but still have questions like;
 
Is Edoofa a scholarship program or an institution like a college or university? 
What courses does Edoofa offer support for?
28/11/23, 11:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I appreciate your thoughtful inquiry, Mrs. Charity. I will do my utmost to provide you with a comprehensive explanation. In essence, *Edoofa* is a distinguished scholarship program, offering 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees to every deserving student. Regarding the selection of colleges or universities, it's important to emphasize that Edoofa is a scholarship program. We have worked with over 250 globally renowned and internationally accredited universities. Concerning the inquiry about courses, there is a wide array of courses, exceeding 3500 in number, which makes it impractical to provide an exhaustive description of each. However, the primary objective of this counseling session is to identify and recommend a course that aligns perfectly with the student's unique career aspirations and goals!
28/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 298 9303: Alright. I get it
28/11/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have a clear understanding of the program, Mrs. Charity?
28/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 298 9303: Maybe not a clear understanding but enough understanding to continue the conversation. Does the Edoofa website say more like in terms of universities which one can choose from

28/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 298 9303: That's fine with me
28/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Charity!
28/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Zimbabwe Republic Police High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 298 9303: We work towards the payment of the fees. However as our Local currency is not stable I am not sure what the figure is like now. I will only know when schools close and fees for 2024 are gazetted and announced
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Tafara's education abroad?
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Together as a family, mom and dad we will be supporting his education abroad as much as we can.
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Admire and Mrs. Charity. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Tafara's well-being is truly admirable!

Tafara will be completing his A'level end of 2024. 
For a pic of his Level results I will send it tomorrow when I collect it from school were they have it in their files
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Charity! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

29/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding Tafara's career aspirations more vividly?
29/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 298 9303: He still needs more guidance. His preferences are still very much changing and understandably so at his age. However I have picked that he aspires for environmentally based careers, with interface with geography, flora and fauna
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates Tafara the most and the origins of his interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited his fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Can I respond tomorrow after I sit down with him and have a discussion?
29/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mrs. Charity. I will be waiting for your response.

01/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 298 9303: Good morning. Yes I am ready but like I said I also have tasks to tend to so I will be balancing my time
01/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity!
01/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates Tafara the most and the origins of his interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited his fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
01/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Tafara seems to be captivated by the study of the environment,, ecology, wildlife studies and environmental science. We have always been very engaging with my children so as to support them in what they enjoy doing as well as to position themselves competitively on a global scale. And my son has always been indicating that he would want to study abroad for a possible career beyond borders. You may be aware that the economy of our country is currently not performing well and young professionals seem to be plying their trades in foreign countries and Tafara is no exception.
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Tafara's deep fascination with the study of the environment, ecology, wildlife studies, and environmental science is truly commendable. Your active engagement and support in nurturing his interests reflect a commitment to providing him with the tools needed to excel in his passion. It's evident that you prioritize your children's aspirations and recognize the importance of positioning them competitively on a global scale, Mrs. Charity!
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. As Tafara's *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide him towards a path that caters to his aspirations. I have analyzed his endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will align perfectly with your magnificent vision:

*BA Geography*

It is one of the specializations of Bachelor of Arts (BA) that deals in various areas such as the study of the features of soil, climate, and plantations are covered in the course besides the geography of the world as a whole.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
01/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 298 9303: I would prefer a Bsc in environmental science or  Ecology or environmental and wildlife studies. The BA in Geography appears to be a bit divergent from what Tafara wants to pursue as a career.

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 298 9303: I am currently traveling. Can we do this around 11
05/12/23, 8:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity!
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Charity. Let us connect at *11:00 A.M. CAT* to resume the session. I will be looking forward to your response.
05/12/23, 4:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Good evening. Yes let's continue
05/12/23, 4:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
05/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Yes I have
05/12/23, 4:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Tafara to India for his higher studies!
05/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Yes. We are actually considering that
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
05/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 298 9303: No I don't have the fees costs
05/12/23, 7:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Charity! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Yes because I understand that we will pay per semester thereby reducing the amount payable at any given time
05/12/23, 7:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Charity! You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
05/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 298 9303: How is that done. I mean the work thing
05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tafara. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -

05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

05/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
05/12/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Thank you. Allow us time to go through the information comprehensively

05/12/23, 10:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 8:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Believe in the magic within you, for that's where dreams come to life." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 298 9303: We can proceed
06/12/23, 9:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity!
06/12/23, 9:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Charity. May I know whether you have been able to comprehend the information propagated during the previous session, please?
06/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 298 9303: We are still discussing the information with a view to understand.
06/12/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Charity. Please do let me know when you are done discussing the information, please.
06/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 298 9303: Right now everyone is out on business and we meet at home at the end of the working hours and that would be evening for us here. I thought you should be aware of that
06/12/23, 10:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. I trust you are well acquainted with the significance of tertiary education, a pivotal juncture in a student's academic journey demanding utmost dedication. It's crucial to note that Edoofa operates on a merit-based scholarship program, employing rigorous criteria rooted in academic excellence. Given the substantial influx of daily applications, our scheduling adheres to a meticulous process, with each student allocated a designated time slot. Recognizing your professional commitments, I kindly inquire about your preferred timings to facilitate a seamless and convenient counseling session, please?
06/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 298 9303: Anytime could do with me. However yesterday evening you shared a lot of information which would require a bit of time to assimilate so that I do not take things for granted. If you want to discuss anything else apart from what you shared yesterday evening we can go ahead
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

*"Success is not just about reaching the destination; it's about enjoying the journey and learning from every step along the way." - John C. Maxwell*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
07/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 298 9303: We can
07/12/23, 9:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity!
07/12/23, 9:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read the information propagated during the previous session, please? <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 298 9303: I did
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
07/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 298 9303: All of them. To me they are complimentary. Hence I have accorded them equal value
07/12/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Charity! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
07/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Of course 1 is the catch
07/12/23, 12:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how you feel about Tafara studying abroad?
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 298 9303: That's my greatest wish
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 298 9303: So true
07/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
07/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 3:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
07/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Noted
07/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Tafara Mukucha Edoofa (23/11) SZ" to "Tafara Mukucha Edoofa (23/11) SZ 2025"
07/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
07/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Okay noted
07/12/23, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
07/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Can I have time to discuss with His father and then I can share what we understand
07/12/23, 6:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Charity. May I know how much time will you be needing, please?
07/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Tonight will be fine

11/12/23, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

11/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Stage 01
11/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/12/23, 8:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 298 9303: Yes please. Explain 5 and 6
12/12/23, 9:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 298 9303: Good morning. Yes
12/12/23, 10:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity!
12/12/23, 10:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

19/12/23, 11:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Charity. Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 298 9303: Good morning. Yes
20/12/23, 9:15 am - ~ charybvunza78 added +263 78 585 3413
20/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 298 9303: I have added my daughter
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Charity! Could you kindly shed more light on her, please?
20/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 298 9303: She is Tafara's elder sister and it would be good for her to also be part of this conversation
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly provide her full name for our records, please? This will help us update your student file accurately.
20/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 298 9303: Tinotenda Amaris Mukucha
20/12/23, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ms. Amaris!
20/12/23, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. I trust that you've had the opportunity to discuss the points mentioned above with your family. I'm here to assist with any questions you may have. Would it be agreeable to proceed with Tafara's application now?
20/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 585 3413: Yes thank you
20/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 298 9303: Yes please do
20/12/23, 10:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
20/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 298 9303: For the course Tafara would prefer Ecology, Geology, Environmental and Marine management.  However you suggested BA in Geography.
20/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 298 9303: This discussion did not highlight other countries as options. You only gave India as the choice. However if Edoofa would still support Tafara's ambition in other countries we are open for that too
20/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 298 9303: If my memory is right the cost is around $6000 or so without a scholarship
20/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 298 9303: For the annual fee again it's around $3000 or so. I'm just relying on my memory of the discussion
20/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 298 9303: The enrollment fee should be around $700
20/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 298 9303: For number 6 please refresh my memory
20/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 298 9303: Am clear about number 7
20/12/23, 10:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on the message, please?
20/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 298 9303: Okay. In Which other countries apart from India does Edoofa support international students
20/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Kindly excuse me for the delay. I am in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application. Thank you for your patience.

20/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 298 9303: I want to share his results for this last term
20/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 298 9303: This message was deleted

20/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing Tafara's results in the group, Mrs. Charity. I truly appreciate your sincerity!
20/12/23, 12:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have done some research regarding BA Geography, please?
20/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Yes I have. It's like you discussed in the group with slight variations in modules in different universities
20/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Universities in different countries
20/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Charity. May I know whether you are facing any challenges with the Course Finalized, please?
20/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Not as such but would be  elated if those options were also available. In Zimbabwe a BA in Geography tends to be limiting someone to the teaching profession of which Tafara is not considering that
20/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Charity. May I know what job role Tafara desires the most, please?
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 298 9303: 1.Geologist 
2. Geographical information Surveyor (GIS) 
3. Ecologist
In that order
20/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. A person with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Geography can pursue a career as both a Geologist and a Geographical Information Surveyor (GIS). A Geologist studies the Earth's structure, composition, and processes, including examining rocks, minerals, and natural resources. The knowledge gained from a geography degree, especially in physical geography, can provide a strong foundation for understanding geological concepts.
20/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: On the other hand, a Geographical Information Surveyor (GIS) specializes in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting spatial data using geographic information systems. A BA in Geography equips individuals with the spatial and analytical skills necessary for GIS work. The interdisciplinary nature of geography allows for a seamless transition into GIS, where professionals use mapping technology to visualize and interpret geographic data.
20/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: In summary, a BA in Geography offers a diverse skill set that can be applied to various fields, including geology and GIS, providing individuals with the flexibility to pursue careers in both disciplines.
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Thanks for the clarification
20/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether the course aligns with the Job Role he desires the most, please?
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 298 9303: As you have explained. Yes
20/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly send all the answers in a numerical format, please?
20/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 298 9303: $3000
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to send all the answers, please.
20/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Which question did I not respond to
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 09:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session     

Stay Blessed!

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

28/12/23, 11:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. As previously mentioned, these topics are integral components of the Geography curriculum. Students have the opportunity to study all these facets as part of their academic journey. Additionally, should Tafara wish to specialize in a particular field among those you've mentioned, he can pursue advanced studies and even attain a Master's degree. To provide you with more precise guidance, I encourage you to conduct thorough research on these topics and their corresponding career and job prospects. This comprehensive understanding will enable me to offer tailored advice based on the specific insights you uncover. I will be more than glad to provide you with more clarity, please.

05/01/24, 12:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/01/24, 9:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
06/01/24, 9:37 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Like I indicated that I traveled out of town I need to get back home first to discuss the process with family and hubby. So I really can't respond to anything now before then
