What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
During my interaction with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa scholarship,l got to know about the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.First and foremost, we talked about how education is given to a wide range of students at an affordable cost.We therefore discussed about the application process which entails about one's educational and family background in detail.More emphasis was made on the accommodation, registration and documentation processes.

Moreover,I learned about the department for student welfare that is setup to assist, support and guide students on how to settle in India without worries.The department also gives a hand on the issue of the Earn While You Learn Program.The program focuses more on offering part time projects to students.This helps in enhancing the skills of the young adults therby earning credits for certain approved tasks which therefore aids an advantage for self financing one's educational process.

Furthermore,I got to learn about the environment and also the diverse culture in India for instance celebrating different festivals with Indian pals.I really loved the part about the seriousness of the mentors whereby they keep on pushing students to excel and  aim towards their academic goals.l also learned about the greatness of India having quite a number of universities for education accessibility to many students out there.

The Edoofa Program also offers a great opportunity for students to learn the Hindi language though English is home to multiple students.In a nutshell,these are some of the interesting and motivating facts l learned about the Edoofa Program.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program ( 20-40 Words)?


I strongly believe this program will provide me an affordable way to pursue higher education which will help achieve my academic goals and make a positive impact on the world.This program will help develop my lifeskills through different tasks.
