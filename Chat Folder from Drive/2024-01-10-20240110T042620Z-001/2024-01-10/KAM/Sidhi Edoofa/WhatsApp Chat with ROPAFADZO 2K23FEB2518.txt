I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 053 8549: Greetings
8/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 9:26 PM - +263 78 053 8549: A lot
9/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's wonderful that you have numerous plans ahead, dear. Could you share if there's a specific goal or change you've set out to accomplish this year?
9/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 053 8549: To reach university levep
9/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 053 8549: Level*

9/1/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is impressive. Attaining higher education is not only a stride towards success but also a journey of self-development.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 053 8549: Ummm You mean im not coming to India in August😳😳😳
9/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: No, dear. I believe you have misunderstood me. I simply wanted to inquire why you were unable to move ahead with the process until Mr. Shivjeet reached out to you recently. However, I am relieved that we are not connected to move ahead with the process. 

May I know if you are ready to go ahead with the discussion now?
9/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 053 8549: Lets move with the process🌝

9/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 053 8549: Ummm no question for now
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

9/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 78 053 8549: Okay
9/1/24, 8:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is good to know that you are following, Ropafadzo. However, my operational hours have come to an end for the day. I will reschedule our conversation for 8:00 AM tomorrow, does that work with you?
