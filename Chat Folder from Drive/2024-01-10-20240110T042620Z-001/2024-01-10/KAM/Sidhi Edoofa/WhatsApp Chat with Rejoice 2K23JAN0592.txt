This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rejoice,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 222 0925: Wow that's very great it is my first time hearing this this is so inspiring
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It indeed is. I am glad that you appreciate hearing the news.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 10:49 PM - +263 78 222 0925: Apologies I could not respond in time since I've been traveling
8/1/24, 10:50 PM - +263 78 222 0925: So far I have not made any changes in 2024 but In case I see the need to make changes I will always notify you
9/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, dear.
9/1/24, 8:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's absolutely fine not to set any New Year's resolutions; concentrating on refining your current situation can be equally impactful and worthwhile.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 78 222 0925: Greetings sir I could not partake for the admission in August as I was preparing for my final exams and now I am free and it is the right time to focus on university admissions
9/1/24, 10:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. Focusing on one's examinations is very important to perform at your best, and I am glad to hear that you were putting forth your best efforts.

May I know if now is a good time to proceed with your university application process?
9/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 222 0925: I think it's now the best time to focus on university admissions
9/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are now ready to move ahead with your application process to ensure that you are able to secure a scholarship seat to the best university for your higher education.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 222 0925: Yes I would like to know the costs for my admission process
9/1/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
9/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 222 0925: Ok I have taken note of it
9/1/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 222 0925: Can I ask if it is always that the university is the one providing food and accomodation
9/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 222 0925: And can l also know if the tuition fees varies from university to university
9/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Some universities provide with both food and accommodation, and in some don't. However with Edoofa, all food and accommodation costs are covered under the annual expense that was shared with you earlier that is $2000 - $3000.
9/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, however, the same applies here as well. All of them are included in the range of $2000 - $3000.
9/1/24, 12:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Does this clarify your query?
9/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 78 222 0925: Ok I have understood
9/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, so can we move forward with your application process?
9/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 222 0925: Ok sure
9/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 222 0925: This is so inspiring thank you
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Rejoice. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
