This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prayer,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you all the best in your future endevours
8/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 352 7223: Thank you very much looking forward for your guidance
8/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 352 7223: You are talking to Prayer l lost my phone and currently using my mothers phone
9/1/24, 8:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear. I am happy to be here to support you.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 6:22 PM - +263 77 352 7223: So far l have no changes but if l have any l will surely notify you
9/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's absolutely fine not to set any New Year's resolutions; concentrating on refining your current situation can be equally impactful and worthwhile.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 77 352 7223: I think this is the right time now.Last time i was at a boarding school and i  was concentrating with my examinations.Now iam available.
9/1/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Prayer. I would like to schedule a session for tomorrow at 8:00 AM to discuss the further application process in detail. Does that work for you?
