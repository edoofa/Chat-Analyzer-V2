I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Good day 
A happy New year to you too
9/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Good morning
I don't think they are any changes I have Decided to make , my goals are still the same, ohhh yes one thing I have decided to do is take my Debating and public speaking career to the next level
9/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 137 6751: I couldn't proceed back then because I wanted to focus on my school work and financial constraints , now the major problem I face currently is financial constraints due to some family emergencies which had to be attended to
9/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. May I ask, what exactly are the difficulties that you are currently facing?
9/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Financial constraints I understand that after being given an offer letter I have to pay about $700 to reserve my spot at the university
9/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, dear. It ranges from $500 - $1000 depending on the university. Do you wish to be briefed about the same?
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes please
9/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

The registration amount ($750) has to be paid within 2 weeks of the date you receive your offer letter. Are you following? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
9/1/24, 11:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates. Is this part clear? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Okay thank you
9/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Do you have any other queries or do you wish to continue with the application process now?
9/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 137 6751: No queries
No I can not proceed with the application process as I have highlighted before that currently financially my parents can not avail the registration fee
9/1/24, 11:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that, dear. But I would like to highlight that the registration fee is *not an additional cost*, it is included in the fees of your first year of study.
9/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you must be preparing financially for your higher education?
9/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes I understand
9/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes but as I had highlighted before, a few emergencies came up
9/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that certain unfortunate emergencies may arise and cause financial inconvenience for us. Your concern is related to the payment of the registration fees, which is a part of your first year of study. If I may ask, how are you preparing for your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Yes the registration fee is my concern
Am trying to find ways to earn and save up for my tertiary education so that I don't strain my parents much as am not the only person whose fees they pay
9/1/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand, Caabilo. It is quite commendable that you are working hard to earn money yourself to sponsor your education. The Edoofa Scholarship Program operates on the same beliefs, providing you with opportunities to self-finance your higher education with the EWYL program. However, with the amount of work you are putting in, you must have some plans as to how you are going to proceed with your higher education?
9/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Plans in terms of ?
9/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Plans in terms of pursuing your higher education, dear.
9/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Maybe we are missing each other at some point can you give an example maybe
9/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You mentioned that you wish to withdraw your application from the Edoofa scholarship program. I would like to understand what your plans for higher education will be.
9/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 71 137 6751: I do wish to withdraw my application I just want to put it on hold until mid February I think my parents would have had enough time to try gather the funds needed for the admission process
9/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 137 6751: If worst come to worst I might take a gap year
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that navigating a financial crisis is challenging, and it is entirely reasonable if you wish to put your application on hold until you have more financial stability. If I were in your position, I would likely consider the same approach. However, if you choose to put your application on hold, there is a specific procedure we follow for such instances. It's crucial to recognize that you have enrolled in a scholarship program that students strive to pursue on a global level, and you have successfully cleared the required processes. Your approach might have left a negative impact with the Academic Board. This program has a limited number of seats, with 69 students already securing their positions, leaving only 31 available for this month. If the seats get filled, you are at a risk of losing this opportunity altogether. As your admission officer, I want to ensure you are well-informed about the current status and the limited availability, allowing you to make an informed decision.
9/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 71 137 6751: Okay I fully understand
9/1/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I ask how you are planning to accumulate funds for the same until mid-February?
9/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 71 137 6751: My parents are working on it  they are hoping things would have stabilized by then
