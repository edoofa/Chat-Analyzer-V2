I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 7:40 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Thank you maa my new year have been great
9/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 77 982 5054: My goal for now is to learn in my Dean country India ❤️
9/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is amazing to hear, Eleanor! I am happy to be here to support you through the process.
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 982 5054: Maam it's because I was waiting to be informed what I was supposed to do next by my mentors by they didn't say it so I thought maybe they shifted it to 2024 bit if there is anything that needs to be done you can kindly inform me maam
9/1/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, Eleanor. There must have been some misunderstanding. However, I am relieved that we are connected now to ensure that you can secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your higher education. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the application process right now?
