27/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Sandile.

How are you doing today?
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: Hie
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We are okay this side
27/12/23, 5:44 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am well and how are you
27/12/23, 7:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that I am great too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are now prepared to take on the session for your admisson process?
27/12/23, 7:23 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am prepared
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 7:26 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l have l concern l would like to raise
27/12/23, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please share it with me.
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l would like to exit the scholarship program
27/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We as parents wonder it is taking too longer to respond to this matter
27/12/23, 8:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know what happened?
27/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l can no longer continue with the scholarship program because of certain personal issues
27/12/23, 8:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, may I know if you might be able to share me with these issues ?
27/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 77 580 2889: The issues are too personal
27/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am not able to tell you everything
27/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We don't feel comfortable to disclose them and I hope you understand
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Sandile,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l wish you all the best in your academic journey
6/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l will be available on Tuesday
6/1/24, 5:43 PM - +263 78 019 2995: God bless you too
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sandile,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 78 019 2995: nice to meet you Mr Singh
I'm Sandile
8/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 78 019 2995: that's a great achievement
8/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 78 019 2995: happy new year to you too
we started our year well

how about you?
9/1/24, 8:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is nice to know you, Sandile. You are talking to Ms. Siddhi Singh. I believe you have mistakenly addressed me as sir.
9/1/24, 8:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear, dear. Thank you for asking me. My year started off really well as well, as I celebrated it with my family. 

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
9/1/24, 8:33 AM - +263 78 019 2995: l am very sorry
my mistake Ms Singh
9/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 78 019 2995: l want to learn a new skill too just like you😃
9/1/24, 8:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is alright Sandile. It is part of human nature to make mistakes.
9/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so good to hear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
9/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 019 2995: thank you
9/1/24, 9:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright dear. May I know if you were able to go through my last message?
9/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 019 2995: actually l would like to exit from the scholarship program?
l talked to Miss Sharda Nayak who advised me to approach the admissions team with this concern
9/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 019 2995: yes l have read it  but unfortunately l would like to exit the scholarship program
9/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me, Sandile. May I know why you wish to withdraw your application from the Edoofa scholarship program?
9/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 019 2995: l am sick and unable to continue with the program...l am seeking treatment but as you know hospital bills leave you in debt
henceforth l can not continue
9/1/24, 9:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that, dear. I am hoping for your speedy recovery and well-being. If I may ask, what are you seeking treatment for?
9/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 78 019 2995: thank you
l am seeking treatment for back aches
9/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you have been able to diagnose the cause of the back aches?
9/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 77 580 2889: Nothing have been seen yet
9/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 019 2995: we have not
9/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 580 2889: Sandile is now exiting all groups because I feel like we have commucated enough for you to understand our position
9/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that, dear. I wish you a swift recovery to full health, enabling you to pursue your dreams.
9/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 78 019 2995: thank you
9/1/24, 11:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, and the final decision to be made is yours. However, I was unable to understand your reason to withdraw as I am concerned for Sandile's higher education.
9/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 77 580 2889: She is not well for the mean time as she had explained already on the above messages
9/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 580 2889: We can't afford both tombe done on the sam time thets the issue
9/1/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 580 2889: Medication is so expensive so we can't afford both
9/1/24, 12:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that medical expenses must be taking a toll on you. However, I am only inquiring about your plans for Sandile's higher education, as education is an aspect that is important to pursue despite facing challenges.
9/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 580 2889: Will look into that later but for the mean time we are focusing on her health
9/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l would like to know about the refund policy?
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Mrs. Jaunda, I appreciate your perspective, and if you decide to focus on your child's education later on, that is entirely your call. However, I am a bit perplexed here. Based on our conversations over the past year, it seems there might be some underlying concerns that haven't been clearly communicated from your end. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since August 2023, when Mr. Shivjeet reached out to help you understand the procedures for your university admission, you mentioned being occupied with exams, which we completely understood. However, subsequent interactions conveyed different reasons for unavailability, ranging from work commitments to health concerns.
9/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, @263780192995  regarding your recent inquiry about the refund policy, I would like to inform you that the same has been shared with you in the Edoofa acceptance letter provided at  the time of your enrollment. If you want, you can refer to that document for your reference.
9/1/24, 2:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: @263775802889  while I understand that Sandile has been unwell, and I empathize with the challenges it brings. However, from our past discussions, it appears that future planning, a crucial aspect for parents, hasn't been addressed over the last couple of months and that is what has been leaving me perplexed. Maybe you can help me understand this better?
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 580 2889: She has been sick since she was in form 2   and again I wasn't lying about her been occupied by exams
9/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We don't have anything else to discuss on this matter and again if it impossible to refund us then that's okay no problem have a good day sir and kindly understand that we are now exiting the grouo and sandile is withdrawing from the program have a good day
9/1/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is perfectly reasonable, ma'am. However, if you place yourself in our position, we have been actively working for over a year on your child Sandile's higher education plans. As Sandile's admission officer, this situation leaves me both concerned and confused about the underlying issue. You mentioned that Sandile has faced health challenges since Form 2, and despite these constraints and the associated medical bills, your family sought the very best for her and her career. This commitment led to the decision for Sandile to pursue education abroad, and you enrolled her in the Edoofa scholarship program.
9/1/24, 3:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If I understand correctly, you made such a challenging decision because you recognized that if Sandile pursued education in Zimbabwe, she would be subjected to the same kind of healthcare available throughout her life, constrained by the economic conditions of your country, which are not conducive for her growth.
9/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, over the past couple of months, there seems to be a shift in decision, and you are considering giving up on everything that you have worked for for Sandile's better career. I am struggling to understand the situation better. Helping me understand the situation for the betterment of you and your child is a decision you, as a parent, have the right to make, and we certainly respect that. If you believe there is nothing more to discuss in this matter, it's important to acknowledge that eventually, Sandile would be at a loss since the decision made now directly impacts her career. Moving forward, we might not have the same opportunity to assist her.
9/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I ask you to take today's time to understand our perspective and also to refer to the refund policy shared with you in your acceptance letter to address the queries you raised.
9/1/24, 6:31 PM - +263 78 019 2995: ok thank you
9/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l found my counseling feedback form and read the refund policy
9/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 019 2995: thank you and goodbye
