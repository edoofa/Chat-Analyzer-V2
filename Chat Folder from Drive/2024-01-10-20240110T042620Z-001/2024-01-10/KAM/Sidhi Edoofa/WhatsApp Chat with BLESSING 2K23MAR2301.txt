It was a good experience and I enjoyed being part of the Edoofa family. On a sad note I am no longer able to continue with my programme reason being I am joining my cousin sister in Dubai. She has arranged something for me so l will be living Zim next year in January. It was nice interacting with you I have learnt a lot, you are such lovely people. Me and my family have enjoyed every session and all the magazines from the head of Edoofa Programme they were motivational, eye opening and they gave a wider picture of what i should be in life. Pass my regards to all those who were with me in this journey of becoming a proud Edoofian as we were all looking forward to that. May you continue with the good caring lovely spirit even to the new Edoofians to come. Have a lovely day. Thank you

It was a good experience and I enjoyed being part of the Edoofa family. On a sad note I am no longer able to continue with my programme reason being I am joining my cousin sister in Dubai. She has arranged something for me so l will be living Zim next year end of January 2024. It was nice interacting with you I have learnt a lot, you are such lovely people. Me and my family have enjoyed every session and all the magazines from the head of Edoofa Programme they were motivational, eye opening and they gave a wider picture of what i should be in life. Pass my regards to all those who were with me in this journey of becoming a proud Edoofian as we were all looking forward to that.

9/1/24, 9:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that you have had such an enriching experience with Edoofa up until now. I will surely convey your regards to everyone in the team.

If I may ask, what are your plans ahead after moving to Dubai with your cousin sister?
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 590 5125: Good day Ms Siddhi. Thank you for the good remarks.

Initially at 16 my passion was to study Culinary Arts. I wished to join Culinary Arts shool by then but I felt I needed to grow whilst at high school because I felt I was too young to live my parents for Dubai because even by then i had an opportunity to go to Dubai to study Culinary  Arts. When I went  for my A level that's when l grew an interest in studying Sociology though deep down my heart l new my interest was in Culinary arts. In December my mum took me for psych tests and the results revealed that most careers suitable for me where to do with food, for example a baker, chef and so forth. Finally that's when I decided to go for Culinary Arts which I felt I was more into as compared to Sociology. However Sociology is something I can still pursue later in life, as far as I can remember quotes and teachings I learnt from magazine wrote by CEO and Director Angad Singh  have taught me that the sky is the limit when it comes to studying and that one can also search for  other skills found in them and can still pursue with them. So my greatest remarks goes to him and the whole team. You really made me discover myself. Job well done keep on keep promoting youngsters with their studies. Many thanks once again in our shona language we say "Tatenda". That is to say thank you for your time and concern about my future studies.
