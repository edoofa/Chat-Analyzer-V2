The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

5/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm ready
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Noted
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm done
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
5/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Following
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
5/1/24, 10:08 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
5/1/24, 10:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: My apologies I was not online for the past hours due to network challenges
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Blessing,

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you
6/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you so much,it was great working with you and all the best in your doctorate
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Greetings Ms Siddhi
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you so much for your willingness to assist me in achieving my goals
8/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Awesome! that's a great achievement
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/1/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It truly is, Blessing.

Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I have decided to spend more time with my family and friends learn a lot of skills from the people around me, commence my bachelor's,meet new friends and learn other cultures moreso helping other students get into Edoofa scholarship program
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is so great, Blessing! Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I was at school and we weren't allowed phones there,yes now it's the right time for me to focus on my university admission journey
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. Schools implement such policies for the benefit of the students, allowing them to concentrate and perform at their best during examinations.

It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same for tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I will
8/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright Blessing. I will connect with you tomorrow. Till then, take care and have a good night!
9/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Good morning
9/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, Blessing. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you today?
9/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm ok ,how are you?
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking, dear.

As per my records, Mr. Shivjeet was in the process of explaining the benefits of the *Endowment Program 2024*, am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes you are correct
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education, and any queries regarding the plans explained by Mr. Shivjeet up until now?
9/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 71 438 0324: No I don't have any queries
9/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. May I know if you are ready to move ahead with our discussion?
9/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yess I'm ready
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Continuing the previous conversation, let us move ahead.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 11:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 71 438 0324: What if I fail to pay the first $450 on the date given by the university
9/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 71 438 0324: And since I preferred taking the august intake is there a chance whereby the registration fee will be required as early as January or February?
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

9/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 11:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to secure the scholarship seat, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving your offer letter, as the number of scholarship seats is limited.  Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month.
9/1/24, 11:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly elaborate any other queries that you have.
9/1/24, 11:35 AM - +263 71 438 0324: Does this mean I might receive the offer letter sometime this month and I will be required to pay the registration fee this month and the other next month
9/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is correct that once your application process is complete and you have received an offer letter, you will be required to pay the registration amount within 2 weeks of receiving the offer letter as per the university. However, with the help of *Endowment Program 2024*, you will have the option of paying 50% of the amount before the deadline given by the university, and the other 50% can be paid within the next 30 days of the initial deadline set by the university.
9/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope that clears your query?
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes thank you
9/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, you are welcome. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 438 0324: May u please provide me with more information about it
9/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, Blessing. Which aspect do you want me to explain?
9/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 438 0324: How my scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter I'm to secure considering I don't have my Alevel results
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I now get it
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Thank you for explaining
9/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is my pleasure, dear. Are you ready to move forward with the admission process?
9/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm ready
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe Mr. Shivjeet introduced you to the first two benefits of the Endowment Program. Would you like me to provide a brief overview of the same, or would you prefer to proceed with the next benefits?
9/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Let's proceed to the benefits

9/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

9/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 71 438 0324: No
9/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm familiar with it that's what we talked about recently
9/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright dear, now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I do agree
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 5:36 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I'm clear
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
9/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
