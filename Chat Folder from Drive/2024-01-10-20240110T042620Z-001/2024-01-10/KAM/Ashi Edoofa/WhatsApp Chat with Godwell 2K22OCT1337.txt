4/1/24, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Godwell. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know what happened?
4/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 082 5059: It's just a random question nothing happened!
4/1/24, 1:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it would be still possible given the fact that you are eligible for the said course.
4/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 082 5059: I wanted to know if I would qualify for MSc Computer  Science?
4/1/24, 1:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to be cleared that you are asking for a Master's Course ?
4/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 082 5059: Sorry BSc not MSc it was a typo
4/1/24, 8:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply. It is alright, for that would you mind sharing your subject combinations with me again, please?
4/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 78 082 5059: Maths Physics and Computer science
4/1/24, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, dear. I have shared the same with the academic board and will let you know by tomorrow please.
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - +263 78 082 5059: Thank you
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 78 082 5059: Hello

9/1/24, 9:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Godwell, 

I trust that you and your family are doing well today.  I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. Kindly excuse us for not connecting with you at the earliest. However, I would like to connect with you today so that we can assist your query, May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion?
9/1/24, 9:44 AM - +263 78 082 5059: We are
9/1/24, 9:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, I am pleased to connect with you today. I observed that you have asked Mr. Shivjeet if you can change your course, May I know why you want to change your course to B.Sc in Computer Science ?
9/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 082 5059: According to my research  I have found that the programme suits many job opportunities and also the  demand for the programme  has rapidly increased over the past 5 years and is set to increase.
9/1/24, 9:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know your thoughts @263780825059, I see that you are want to change your course from B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) to  B.Sc in Computer Science, I will have a conversation with my team and then will share their feedback with you in the evening, I hope that's fine ?
9/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 082 5059: It's okay thank you
9/1/24, 9:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263780825059
9/1/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: While I have noted your concern, I would like to understand the thoughts behind choosing B.Sc in Computer Science, I am assuming that you are interested in Computers, right ?
9/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 082 5059: Yes being the reason I chose computer science for my Advanced Level
9/1/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 082 5059: By the way my results will be out tomorrow  so I will send them to you tomorrow
9/1/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, I wish you all the best for your results!
9/1/24, 10:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As you shared that you are interested in learning Computer Science, considering your interest I have a better recommendation for you if you want to change your course according to your interest. May I know if you are interested in knowing the same ?
9/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 082 5059: Yes I am
9/1/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects and passion for computer science, you are eligible for *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering*. This degree will not only provide you with a solid foundation in computer science but also open up numerous career opportunities.

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
9/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 082 5059: According  to my research again the B.Tech degrees will need an additional  year to get an honours  one
9/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 082 5059: Maybe if you can explain the difference  between a B tech degree and an honours degree it can help <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, I will be more than happy to assist you here. Let me share that the duration of  B.Sc in Computer Science is three years while B. Tech. honours in Computer Science is generally a 4 year course. When choosing a course, it is essential to consider your interests, skills, and career goals. The B.Sc. in Computer Science program equips students with the skills needed to contribute to the exciting and rapidly changing field of computer science. On the other hand, the B.Tech. Honours in Computer Science program offers a more comprehensive understanding of computer science concepts and techniques, which can be beneficial for students who want to pursue a career in this field of Computer Science.
9/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 082 5059: If the B.Sc is 3 years only that would be good since the content would be the same
9/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here @263780825059, B.Tech is being more industry-oriented program. B.Tech in Computer Science may provide more practical and industry-oriented education, while B.Sc in Computer Science may provide more theoretical and mathematical concepts. If one wants to work in the tech-world, B.Tech Computer Science is the best choice. 

I can understand that you are having concern due to the duration of the course, is my understanding right ?
9/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 082 5059: I will go for the Btech one <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263780825059, I will have a discussion with the team and then share their response with you.
9/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 082 5059: Thank you
9/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263780825059, I hope you are doing well!
9/1/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to share that I had a discussion with the team about your request. On the same note, Please write a mail to academicboard@edoofa.com stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Ashi about changing your course from B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) to B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) and that you have finalized the same for yourself after discussion with your parents and they support you in this discussion of yours. 

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail and once done please share the screenshot with me here.
9/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 78 082 5059: Ok thank you
9/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, May I know when you will share this mail ?
9/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 082 5059: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me, Have a good day ahead!
