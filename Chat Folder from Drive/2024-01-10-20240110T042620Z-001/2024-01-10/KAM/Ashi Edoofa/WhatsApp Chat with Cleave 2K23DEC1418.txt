26/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

27/12/23, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem @263771722758 Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:00 PM.
27/12/23, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

28/12/23, 9:25 AM - +263 77 172 2758: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cleave, Wishing you a good day!
28/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form, On this note May I know if you have completed the academic questions?
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 2 : Difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference between human rights and civil rights..
Firstly l would like to explain the meaning of word rights ,rights are legal, social or ethical principles of freedom.. Duties are a task or action that one is required to perform as part of one's job..it can be called assignment, task ,chores and mission.. Therefore the difference between the two is noted ..moreover the difference between human rights and civil rights need to be noted , human rights are rights one acquires by being alive while Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state.Civil rights are legal rights that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex and other characteristics.. It is important to know human rights are rights you are born with you have them simply by being human, whether or not they have been put into the  form of a law in the country where you reside..both human rights and civil rights protect against discrimination, injustice and inequality though it is important to note the difference between the two as Civil rights are designed to protect individuals in freedom from violation by government, political and social..
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 3:  The difference between a prosecutor and Attorney..

It is important to note that an attorney is a lawyer who practices as a professional advicer or advocate in legal matters. While a Prosecutor is a lawyer who determines whether to charge an individual for a crime and works to establish that person's guilt in court. He works to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the defence attorney attempts to create reasonable doubts so that their client is deemed innocent.. A good prosecutor is proficient in investigative work, writing, and sneaking. They can create a strong case against an accused and at ease in front of a jury or a judge .In addition to being experts in all facets of criminal law ,prosecutors must be skilled in communicating with other parties including the victims, defense witness, judges and law enforcement. A defence attorney is a prosecutor's counterpart. An attorney who protects a person or business against criminal accusations is a defence Attorney hence it can be argued that they is a different between an Attorney and a prosecutor..
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 4:which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, corporate or criminal law and Why?

Civil law offers a high degree of legal certain as the laws are explicitly defined and interpreted by the legislative. This predictability can provide stability and confidence to individuals and businesses when making legal decisions. It ensures that the rights and protection of citizens are called for .The rule of law dictates that government should not abuse their powers as per AV diceys concept of the rule of law. The civil courts endorse economic activity, allowing contracts to be made between strangers they are breached.To study the civil law it requires business sense, communication creative problem solving and organization those are some of the skills l have thus why l think l deserve to study civil law. It also deals with cases that are mostly related to divorce, child custody, property ownership and personal property damage.. hence  could love to pursue Civil law  due to my desire to change life and help people..
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 172 2758: What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.


Law is about understanding your clients business and providing viable solutions .it is therefore important to have a wide breadth of knowledge of current events to fully grasp the context of the work that you are involved in a lawyer. Improve your commercial awareness by watching business related television programs such as panorama. Attention to detail , accuracy is a vital law skill and is pivotal to the success of your legal career. Communication is a strong oral and written communication skills are  crucial to a legal career without them you will struggle to carry out duties of a solicitor effectively. Teamwork and winning cases is a team effort. Solicitors need to collaborate with leagues and partners as well as liaise with clients .The ability to work as part of a team is an essential legal skills and you will need to be able to deal with people from all levels of legal hierarchy from trainees and pupils, to members of the judicially.

28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Welcome greetings ma'am
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024).
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/F3oPsiSjO4c1ji76N6RRJ9
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
28/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Noted ma'am am excited can't Wait
28/12/23, 2:56 PM - +263 78 602 7126: So can l join the group now
28/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263786027126
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Yes exactly
28/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 3:17 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Indeed ma'am
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Can't wait
28/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Indeed it's important to recognized the ranking and affordability of the university
28/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Noted so  when can we expect the offer letter because for now the amount  needed  we can arrange it by the end of January ma'am
28/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your query @263786027126, your offer letter will take somedays to process as the letter is issued by the university.
28/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Yes noted .am following
28/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Deadline within 2 weeks for the registration fee or for the $2800per annum
28/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, the deadline is for the registration fees please. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 78 602 7126: When is this paid also the first year amount
28/12/23, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786027126 The registration fees will be paid after you receive the offer letter from the university and the first year amount will be paid in the next year when you will arrive in India
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Yah the monthly payment is a good idea indeed
28/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Sorry ma'am you are saying for instance l receive the offer letter in January and pay the $1000 when the $ 900 l have to pay it also in January within three dayz
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Noted ma'am but  l Will receive the offer letter next year 2024 and l will arrive in India 2024 August so the amount is paid in which month
28/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Let me help you understand better for example if you receive the offer letter in January, 2024 that's when you will be required to pay the registration fees of $1000. Now, When you will come India in August 2024, that's when you will be required to pay $900 for your tuition fees. I hope that's clear now?
28/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Exactly thank ma'am l understand now .so is there another amount needed to be paid during the process after paying the $1000  registration fee
28/12/23, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No @263786027126, After paying the registration fees you only need to pay for the Visa and Flight Tickets.
28/12/23, 4:15 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Noted  ma'am l understand now  and after arrival is there other expense need  to be arranged for except $900
28/12/23, 4:18 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Can't wait to be part and parcel of the education of India ma'am
28/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263771722758
28/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 172 2758: Noted we are looking forward to the EWYL program
28/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 4:33 PM - +263 77 172 2758: No queries for now but if we have don't worry ma'am we will feel free to ask as a family
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth.

28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

28/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786027126, For this concern we do have something special which we will share with you soon.
28/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
28/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
28/12/23, 4:42 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Indeed as l said you will be proud .. Ma'am l promise
28/12/23, 4:45 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Wonderfully together we can doing indeed thank you
28/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263786027126, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
28/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
28/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
28/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Sure because financial problems are trying to destroy the future of a lot of students
28/12/23, 4:51 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Yes let's do that ma'am ..am following
28/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
28/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
28/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
28/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 78 602 7126: L believe my  A level and O level certificates find you well
28/12/23, 5:11 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Sure l pray all goes well during the process
28/12/23, 5:12 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Indeed we are greatful and thus why we rate Edoofa scholarship program as the best .. Be blessed
28/12/23, 5:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/12/23, 5:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/12/23, 5:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 5:19 PM - +263 78 602 7126: 🙏🙏🙏💯 it's making sense indeed intact it's good news ..
28/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
28/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Wonderful ma'am    .. L get u
28/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 78 602 7126: Sorry ma'am thank you for today's session now am  preparing to go to work ... Am working night shifts currently.. Can we please continue tomorrow

Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?

This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
