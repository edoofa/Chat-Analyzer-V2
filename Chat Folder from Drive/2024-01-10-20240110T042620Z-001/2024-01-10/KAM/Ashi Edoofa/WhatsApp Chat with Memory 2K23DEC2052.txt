9/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
9/1/24, 1:14 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes we can
9/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 1:19 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I am done
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
9/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
9/1/24, 1:21 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Very clear
9/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
9/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
9/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
9/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I am
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
9/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
9/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
9/1/24, 1:38 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: They are
9/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
9/1/24, 1:52 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I would love to go further with the discussion but at the moment the headteacher from the school where I work has given me some work. So I humbly ask if possible to reschedule.
The teacher says he will get the recommendation letter written in the evening so it must be ready by tomorrow
9/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Memory, I understand that you are occupied at the moment. May I know if can reconnect today at 3:00 pm ?

9/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing amazing insights with us, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
9/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes I do agree
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Of course we are
9/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
9/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

9/1/24, 4:29 PM - +265 880 26 63 24: If all goes well I feel like I will be available by tomorrow 3pm because we are having electricity problems at the moment
