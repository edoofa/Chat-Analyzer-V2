Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
26/12/23, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

26/12/23, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
26/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 77 152 3463: most probably mid january

26/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i'm ready
26/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:21 PM - +263 77 152 3463: done
26/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
26/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes they are
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/12/23, 4:52 PM - +263 77 152 3463: iam following
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 152 3463: clear
26/12/23, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes
26/12/23, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/12/23, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/12/23, 5:07 PM - +263 77 152 3463: iam ready
26/12/23, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you
26/12/23, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771523463 I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/12/23, 5:43 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i will be through by 1830 CAT
26/12/23, 5:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263771523463. Please do let me know once you have gone through the videos.
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i've gone through the videos
26/12/23, 6:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
26/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 77 152 3463: The first video explains the importance of following instructions and being open minded and how people who are not teachable often blame circumstances when they fail

The second video from my understanding is describing how Edoofa is genuinely creating these opportunities for us to get the kind of education we deserve and the founders talk about how an agent in Ghana exploited a student financially but Edoofa isn't here to exploit students 

The third video explains how the program has created these ties with various institutions in India and for the organization to be able to get us to top universities that'll further our knowledge and skills

The fourth video talks about the statement of purpose and it's importance on how it projects you to universities and create a best first impression
26/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Nyasha, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/12/23, 7:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/12/23, 7:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
26/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i agree and i understood
26/12/23, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/12/23, 7:17 PM - +263 77 152 3463: we are
26/12/23, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
26/12/23, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/12/23, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

26/12/23, 7:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?

28/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha, Wishing you a good day!
28/12/23, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 77 221 3657: Good Afternoon sir. I am fine and at work.
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 77 221 3657: we can continue
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, May I know if you have completed the SOP form and academic interview questions?
28/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 77 152 3463: sorry for the delay, yes i completed them
28/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 77 152 3463: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 5:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, What about the academic questions?
28/12/23, 5:59 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes
28/12/23, 6:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Could you please share your response with us?
28/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 152 3463: primary memory has two important characteristics: it is volatile, and it is also capable of being accessed randomly.It is volatile because the data and programs stored in main memory are retained only as long as the system is on. When the system is turned off, all data and programs stored in random access memory are lost. Examples of primary memory include RAM,ROM and flash memory

RAM is an expensive form of memory for a computer system.Thus, when there is need to store large amounts of data, other, less expensive forms of memory may be used. As a result computers will have secondary storage in addition to primary storage. Secondary memory usually takes the form of magnetic disks, SSD and hard drives.Secondary memory devices permit you to store more data and programs than the CPU's main memory would.Thus main main memory only has to be big enough to store the current program and current data on which you are working.Your other programs and other data may be stored externally on magnetic disks or flash drives
28/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 152 3463: The Open Systems Interconnection Model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.It split into seven different layers
1.Physical Layer
Concerned with transmitting raw data across the network from the physical layer of sending device to physical layer of receiving device.
2.Data Link Layer
Connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. It also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.
3.Network Layer
Is responsible for receiving frames from  data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame
4.Transport Layer
Manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts.
5.Session Layer
Controls the conversations between different computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5.
6.Presentation Layer
Formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. 
7.Application Layer
At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application.
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 77 152 3463: Operator overloading means overloading existing operators with more tasks. For example operations such as subtraction of integers and subtraction of real numbers have already been defined for minus (-) operator, we can define another task of subtracting two time objects for minus (-) operator. This process of overloading operator with one more task is called operator overloading. We can overload unary as well as binary operators.
Python operator overloading refers to a single operator's capacity to perform several operations based on the class of operands
You overload an operator in C++ by defining a function for the operator. Every operator in the language has a corresponding function with a name that is based on the operator. You define a function of this name that has at least one parameter of the class type, and returns a value of whatever type that you want. Because functions can have the same name if they have different signatures, the compiler will apply the correct operator function depending on the types in the call of it.
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 77 152 3463: Technology helps mankind in utilizing the natural resources that are hidden in land, water bodies and mountains.Zimbabwe is already a lithium rich country and technology will help the country make lithium product itself rather other export all of it and later buy expensive products from the raw material you produced.Zimbabwe is an agricultural country and technology will help to introduce better fertilizers for plants and agricultural land, tractors, the invention of high yield seeds and effective pesticides.A technological revolution will result in the cultivation of good crops and become a profitable profession and help in putting an end to the shortage of food and grains.
Technology will help in developing and producing at a higher rate in the economy.Producing more will mean the country will import less and maybe bring value to the Zimbabwean dollar and bring down the skyrocketing inflation.Technological progress will also implement important advantages to the society and its people present.

28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 77 152 3463: that's correct
28/12/23, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 152 3463: correct
28/12/23, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 152 3463: correct
28/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes we are
28/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
28/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 77 152 3463: noted
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 6:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 8:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263771523463, As I was looking forward for your response, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
29/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 221 3657: i am ready but i am at work let me call Nyasha  to find out
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 152 3463: we are ok with everything
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i understand
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we start our session for today?
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes
29/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 152 3463: noted
29/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 77 152 3463: all clear
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 77 152 3463: noted
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 77 152 3463: wonderful
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263771523463 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 77 152 3463: we thank you for your work
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263771523463. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/12/23, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/12/23, 3:01 PM - +263 77 152 3463: noted
29/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 77 152 3463: great
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 77 152 3463: it does
29/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 77 152 3463: it does
29/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 77 152 3463: all clear
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - +263 77 152 3463: iam not aware
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - +263 77 152 3463: clear
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
29/12/23, 4:32 PM - +263 77 152 3463: right
29/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/12/23, 4:34 PM - +263 77 152 3463: i agree
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/12/23, 4:39 PM - +263 77 152 3463: clear
29/12/23, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
29/12/23, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/12/23, 5:14 PM - +263 77 152 3463: yes
29/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
29/12/23, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
29/12/23, 7:04 PM - +263 77 152 3463: noted
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - +263 77 152 3463: everything's clear
29/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/12/23, 7:14 PM - +263 77 152 3463: very excited
29/12/23, 7:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
