In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Afternoon how are you mam

Yes I'm ready for it
27/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you. I am glad to know that you are ready for today's session, May I know if you have gone through the videos shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
27/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes, I went through all of them
27/12/23, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 77 198 7801: For a student to have high scholarship credits and maximum scholarship, he should be teachable and open minded i.e he should be intelligent and creative. Also he should follow intrusctions accordingly.

 The vision of tge founders of Edoofa is that quality education but accessible and that students must job ready after course completion. So they invested a lot of time to seacrh for universities in which Edoofians should go and student must be able convince the university admission team the same he or she convinced the Admission Board of Edoofa. This is done by filling the SOP form
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263771987801 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok I forgot to introduce my self pardon me for that

Am Rhodyn Richmore Makaza
27/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear,
27/12/23, 5:23 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I do agree with all of the info
27/12/23, 5:23 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Thanks
27/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes we are together

Let's move on mam. It's very vivid and understandable
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

I hope by then you will be able to complete the task. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
28/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 77 198 7801: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Richmore, I hope you are doing well.
28/12/23, 8:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024).
28/12/23, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Thanks same to you!
29/12/23, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Richmore , Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Afternoon how are you
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes am ready
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes it is very correct mam
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Mam, when the answers wanted of the questions you send me are wanted
29/12/23, 2:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, If you have completed them you can share it with us.
29/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok mam I've left with few  areas which I want to take a good research but soon I will share the answers
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I do agree with you dear
29/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263771987801. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes we have discussed it and it is clear
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I'm getting you correct. We are still together on this page
29/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
29/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 2:50 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes mam, but I want you to shade light on what  miscellaneous fee covers
29/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You will get a better clarity on the same once you will receive the offer letter, however let me share that this cost included your Library fee, sports fees and many others.
29/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok now we 're together
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok understood
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 77 198 7801: All is clear mam, I have no question on this
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 3:20 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok I mam, I want to ask on the issue of universities reg fee.
*Is this fee to be paid once or it can be paid in halves?*
29/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 77 198 7801: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi Kapoor and she has scheduled my session for 2 Jan 2024 at  0830hre to 0930hrs*
29/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand you query dear, Let me share that for the registration fees we have a flexible payment plan, we will share them same with you soon. Shall we proceed?
29/12/23, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
29/12/23, 3:30 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes let's move on mam
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes and that's my wish and will too
29/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

I would love to continue with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
30/12/23, 12:52 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Am sory unfortunately networks suddenly shut down
30/12/23, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greeting @263771987801, May I know if your network is stable now?
30/12/23, 12:56 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes now we can continue mam
30/12/23, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/12/23, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/12/23, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
30/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I like it
30/12/23, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/12/23, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
30/12/23, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok that's very nice
30/12/23, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/12/23, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok this is understandable dear
30/12/23, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
30/12/23, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes it's very clear mam
30/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/12/23, 1:38 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ive nothing to say on this issue
30/12/23, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I'm excited with it
30/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
30/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
30/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok mam thanks
30/12/23, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear
30/12/23, 7:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Richmore ,

Business process management life cycle  involves designing, modelling, execution, monitoring and optimisation of the process. It is used to improve business process for example sales process management. The first step is to identify the process and define its goal and objectives. Then after this you start to design the process flow considering inputs and outputs. Then the following stage is modelling. On this stage you will be assigning tasks to appropriate stakeholders providing them with resources to do the process. After that you go on on process execution. After executing the process you then monitor the process noting faults and areas which may need improvement. Finally you continue improving the process that is process optimisation.

Business contibute to a greater extent to economic development in the sense that business pay taxes to the government thereby increasing government's revenue to build schools, roads, hospitals and many more. Also businesses create employment to the local people that is raising their standards of living. The GDP of a country increases since there will be many people working. Furthermore, businesses enter into new markets with new goods and services thus satisfying consumers' demands and preferences since new items are brought in.  Moreover, business brings foreign currency in the country. In addition to the above points, business also creates competion in the markets thereby leading to reduced prices thus increasing customers savings. This in turn leads to increased government's revenue.

Taking myself as an example, I have got some fruit plantations of which I'm the manager of them all.

I usually employe some part time workers to help me weeding, maintaining and harvesting the fruits. So I take my time to commucate with them, learnig their behaviours and noting thier life experiences that means I've got good communication skills.

Also, I effectively schedule duties so that I will have good harvest. This also helps my staff to have enough time to work and rest and this increases productuvity. 

Sometimes I will be not available, so I have to delegate someone to be in charge of the plantations duties such as monitoring workforce, assigning tasks and noting where chemical control is needed.

I usually give my workforce about 2 litres cooking oil and 2kg sugar per each worker after harvesting so as to motivate them.

Human resource is an important department in an organisation and no business organisation flourish without this department.

The HR department is the one which recruits workers in an organisation. Once it recruits unskilled workforce, that organisation will be not sustain the competition due to shoddy products produced.

Also th HR department is the one that identifies if there is need for employee training. This will help the company to increase its productivity since workers will be skilled of their work. 

Also, once workers are trained, it means quality products will be produced hence market share increment since consumer taste and preferences will be met.

Also the HR department ensures safety of workers. This helps organisation to reduce its costs since there will be less or no accidents at work. This in turn increases productivity since workforce will have no disturbances.
