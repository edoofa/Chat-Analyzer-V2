I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
20/12/23, 6:21 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes we had the chance to do that as  a collective
20/12/23, 6:23 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: For the lovely professional university
20/12/23, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/12/23, 6:28 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: We were all delighted with the news and most of the questions we had were already answered in the last session
20/12/23, 6:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/12/23, 6:33 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: Non sir
20/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/12/23, 6:38 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes i did I also noticed that its the leading international school in india and also having graduates who work in influential companies eg Google..........and its school well know of discipline and high standards education
20/12/23, 6:40 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: Yh that's the summary <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, that is indeed true. LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. It would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment of $550 so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes
20/12/23, 6:47 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: We plan to start the process tomorrow
20/12/23, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
20/12/23, 6:51 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: True
20/12/23, 6:51 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: And thank you
20/12/23, 6:51 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @265996127266, I saw you wanted to ask a general question may I know what was it if you do not mind me asking?
20/12/23, 7:00 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: I thought it may not be relevant but anyway the question is:

Does LPU also give scholarship for the  computer engineering course? 

If yes, do they allow change of course after already offering a scholarship like this one
20/12/23, 7:08 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: As I said this was just a general and just out of curiosity
20/12/23, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking your concern, let me help you understand yes please LPU may offer more than 250+ courses, and if a student is eligible for a course in Computer engineering he/she can change their course after they arrive in India.
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: This is good information
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +265 996 12 72 66: Thank you
20/12/23, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
20/12/23, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
