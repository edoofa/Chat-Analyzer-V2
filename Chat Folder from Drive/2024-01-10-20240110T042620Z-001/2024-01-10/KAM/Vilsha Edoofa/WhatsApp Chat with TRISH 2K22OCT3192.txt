I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of spirits. As we step into the New Year, I want to take this opportunity to convey my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the coming year be filled with joy, prosperity, and success for each member of your family.

8/1/24, 4:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 4:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 849 4335: Greetings. Thank you so much for the thoughtful gesture. Compliments of the new year 🎊. We are well as a family.
9/1/24, 5:35 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263788494335. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

In light of the same, may I ask what changes or additions have you decided to make in the year 2024 for you and your family?
9/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 78 849 4335: Hello dear. Thank you for your concern. Since it's just the beginning of the year..we are still trying to make ends meet financially. Hoping to seeing positive change this year.
