I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for your patience; Pardon me for not being able to connect with you earlier due to technical difficulties. How are you and your family doing today as we approach the best time of the year, filled with joy and holidays?
18/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are doing ok this side

How are you?
18/12/23, 5:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am good thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
18/12/23, 5:43 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes we may proceed please
18/12/23, 5:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes this is correct
18/12/23, 6:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Please go through with these and after you are done with it, please let me know of the same. So that we can discuss it on the upcoming days.
18/12/23, 6:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
18/12/23, 7:48 PM - +263 77 738 3415: I understand
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are doing well thank you
19/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: How are you?
19/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
19/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We may proceed but we are having network problems this side so some messages may arrive late
19/12/23, 7:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, may I know if you were able to go through the above points?
19/12/23, 9:27 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l was able to go through the points
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Patience!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 738 3415: We are good thank you

How are you?
20/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l was able to go through the above points
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes please
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
20/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Yes l agree
20/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
20/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
20/12/23, 7:53 PM - +263 77 738 3415: You are correct
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
20/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
20/12/23, 8:17 PM - +263 77 738 3415: Correct
20/12/23, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Patience!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?

This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
