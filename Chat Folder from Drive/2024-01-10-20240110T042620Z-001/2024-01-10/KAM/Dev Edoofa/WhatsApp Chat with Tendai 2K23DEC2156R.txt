6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 131 9112: Thanks you very much
We are clear
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
6/1/24, 11:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Tendai 2K23DEC2156R*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

8/1/24, 8:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind, and ensure that your admission process is on track. I am aware that Tendai is now at school. Hence, I wanted to understand if you as parents/guardians will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?

9/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Please note that i will reshare the forms tomorow with Tendai's passport size photo, i have been trying to check but seems its actually at home and im currently  at work.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tendai.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Tendai will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Tendai is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Good evening
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: My day was alright, thank you
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Let us work with 5 to 6pm
9/1/24, 8:20 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you
9/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 77 340 7203: If this is a little late im also available between 1 and 2pm
