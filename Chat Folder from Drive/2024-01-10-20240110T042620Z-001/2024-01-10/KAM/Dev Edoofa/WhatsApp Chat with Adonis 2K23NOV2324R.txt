19/12/23, 10:22 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Adonis !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Good evening to you too , yes we are
21/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did go through
21/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes can you explain further
21/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:10 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay I agree
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yah I can see it now makes sense now
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
21/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 77 168 2406: I see
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 77 168 2406: For this we already transact in US dollars so we already have a nostro account
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Adonis. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. I was not able to connect with you yesterday. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: How are you
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we are available
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 71 480 1825: We are all good 
Yes we are available
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes we are
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/12/23, 8:18 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Okay this is understandable and Okay
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay yeah understandable here
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes
27/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We will discuss it by tomorrow and give you feedback
27/12/23, 8:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Evening
28/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 77 168 2406: We can proceed
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes we can proceed
28/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to have a conversation with your family regarding the Edoofa secure plan with your family?
28/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we did and it's okay we can proceed
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me. I shall be having a conversation with the accounts team and getting back to you very shortly to pass on the next update.
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Oky
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Ol
28/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 168 2406: Ok
29/12/23, 9:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to continue with the session today as I was on a call with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐
29/12/23, 9:35 PM - +263 71 480 1825: Happy new year to you too
