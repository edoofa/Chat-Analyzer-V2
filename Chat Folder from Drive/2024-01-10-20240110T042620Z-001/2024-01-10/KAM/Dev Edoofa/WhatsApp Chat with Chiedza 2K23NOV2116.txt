29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Chiedza!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of Spirits. 

While I was organizing my day for today, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee today. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee today? <This message was edited>

4/1/24, 9:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.

5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We are fine
5/1/24, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 339 4607: We can proceed
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Im done
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 7:59 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Clear
5/1/24, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 339 4607: Yessd
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 77 339 4607: Good morning at step 5 we were asked to pay $350 and we paid $200 on the 29 th of November and we were supposed to pay $150 by 29 December and failed. But we are working in it so that we pay on the 13th of January this year. If it is possible

9/1/24, 9:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
