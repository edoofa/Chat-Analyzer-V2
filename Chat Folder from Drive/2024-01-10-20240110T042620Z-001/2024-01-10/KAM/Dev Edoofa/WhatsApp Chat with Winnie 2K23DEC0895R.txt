I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good Evening. We understand your troubles and thank you for getting back to us. 8:30 am is okay. We will be in contact then.

9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
9/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Winnie EWYL23E1049*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
9/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 164 7225: We are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
9/1/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
9/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Well our experience with our counselor, Shubham Madhwal, was very pleasant. He was very reassuring and helpful. We had our questions answered before we knew. What really impressed us was the pace of our sessions, he responded quickly and rarely kept us waiting. We were also impressed by the experiences of the EDOOFA students that he shared with us to reassure us of the progress and effectiveness of the program. <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 9:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have known Mr. Shubham for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track. 
We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to all and assist hardworking students in launching their careers in their respective fields.  

We are delightful that you are impressed by the the Edoofa scholarship Program.
9/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, before moving forward, may I Please know if you have printed the forms that were shared with you?
9/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 78 164 7225: not yet unfortunately, printing services are not available at the moment but we will be in the city in this week and it will be done.
9/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. But I would highly recommend you to print the forms as soon as possible. As those forms are important to move forward with our sessions.
9/1/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you understand?

9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 164 7225: Is it possible to fill the forms in on the phone? Is that an option? <This message was edited>
9/1/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Since these are essential forms that need to be filled, these are supposed to be handwritten. That is why our main emphasis was on getting the forms printed.

9/1/24, 3:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: The sponsor is the one who will be handling Winnie's finances for higher education. I hope I was able to clear your query?
9/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you so much
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Winnie.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Winnie will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Winnie is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:07 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 78 164 7225: Good evening. Yes we are currently occupied at the moment. Thank you for offering us the convenience of communicating when available. *11:00 AM* is the appropriate time for us.
