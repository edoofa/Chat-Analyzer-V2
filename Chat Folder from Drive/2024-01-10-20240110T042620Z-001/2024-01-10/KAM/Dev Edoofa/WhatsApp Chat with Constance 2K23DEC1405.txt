27/12/23, 4:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about Constance's university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes
27/12/23, 4:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:32 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Noted
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:35 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes they are
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 78 403 8287: It's clear
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Yes
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes, understood
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 679 3336: It's all clear
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 77 679 3336: No queries
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 78 403 8287: It's all clear and we have noted everything
27/12/23, 4:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - +263 78 403 8287: We have done this already
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thanks for letting me know Constance. Due to some technical glitch, I think the same message was repeated twice
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 5:12 PM - +263 78 403 8287: Yes
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

27/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 77 679 3336: Ok
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

Random Access Memory is used to perform necessary tasks while the computer is on.It is a short term memory and it is volatile.RAM can be modified ,erased and read.Types of data stored in Ram are operating system,parts of application software in use, instructions awaiting processing, immediate results of processing awaiting output,data awaiting to be written to storage media.RAM has three types which are static Ram (SRAM) , Dynamic Ram (DRAM), Synchronous Dynamic Ram (SDRAM).
ROM-is non-volatile and it permanently stores instructions for a computer.Data in ROM cannot be edited or deleted.ROM stores instructions that tell the computer how to perform basic functions such as initializing hardware components and loading the operating system (these instructions are referred to as firmware because they remain unchanged after the computer has been programed.
Secondary memory is also known as backup memory.Examples are Hard disk drives,Solid state drives, Optical drives,USB flash drives, floppy disks

It is a model of communication designed by ISO (International Standards Organization). It allows computers from different manufacturers or origin  to be connected together.The idea is that suppliers must produce hardware or software to implement any of the seven layers while other suppliers provide those of other layers promoting standardization.The seven layers are - Application,Presentation,Session,Transport, Network,Data link, Physical.
Application layer - defines how user application interface or access communication services, initiates or accepts a request, provide a network applications like data transfer, messaging and operating system functions.
Presentation layer-deals with how information is presented for example ASCII,adds formatting or data transformation (for instance from ASCII to Unicode),data compression and data encryption.
Session layer-creates and terminates sessions for example login session,file transfer session, adds traffic flow control information.The session layer is also responsible for deciding on the communication method.
Transport layer-allows error correction during transmission,maintains flow control,allows data recovery, and allows routing, addressing and multiplexing of signals.It implements communication methods - implements the functions necessary to send data to the communication partner.These mechanisms include multiplexing data from different applications establishing data integrity,and management of virtual circuits.
Networ layer-adds sequencing and address information,sets logical protocols, creating frames(consisting of address fields,control field,date and error control field).
Data Link Layer-provide error-checking and formats data for physical transmission,defined network type and packet sequencing,used for synchronization.
Physical layer-it is responsible for sending data and receiving data across a physical medium.The data is sent in bits , either 0 or 1.
3/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 77 679 3336: 4)Operator overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows operators to behave differently depending on the type of data they are operating on. In C++, Java, and Python, operator overloading allows developers to create their own custom operators. This can make code more readable and expressive. In C++, for example, operator overloading can be used to create custom operators for classes, such as adding two points in a coordinate system.ln Java, operator overloading is used to create custom operators for classes and interfaces. For example, the addition operator can be overloaded to add two BigInteger objects, which are used to represent very large integers. In Python, operator overloading is used to create custom operators for user-defined classes. For example, the addition operator can be overloaded to add two instances of a class that represents a date.In C++, operator overloading can also be used to create custom assignment operators. For example, the assignment operator can be overloaded to assign values to custom data structures. In Java, the assignment operator can be overloaded to assign values to user-defined objects. In Python, operator overloading can be used to create custom comparison operators. For example, the "less than" operator can be overloaded to compare two instances of a custom class.

For example, advancements in robotics and automation can help businesses produce goods and services more efficiently. This can lead to increased profits and economic growth. Additionally, technology can create new markets and job opportunities. The development of the internet, for example, has led to the growth of the e-commerce industry.
