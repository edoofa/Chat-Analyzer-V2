This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand.

3/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Ok sir
3/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Yes sir
3/1/24, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 218 5787: I’m done sir
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Yes sir
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Yes l am following sir
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Yes clear sir
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 218 5787: I don’t think l will be able to upload the videos sir so how about tomorrow
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay Delane. I have taken a note of this and completely understand. So, what we can do is that I can share you the videos right now and you can watch the videos whenever you get a chance today or tomorrow.
We will take forward the further session after that, as it will not hinder the further process.
3/1/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know what do you feel about this?
3/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Ok sir
3/1/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: great
3/1/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

3/1/24, 2:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Delane, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

8/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine. Thank you so much for asking.
8/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let's start.
8/1/24, 11:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, before moving forward, May I please get to know about your understanding of the 4 videos that were shared with you?
8/1/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 218 5787: To be honest with you the video haven’t yet opened them they  are just loading maybe it’s because of network problems sir
8/1/24, 11:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand Dylan, the network challenges that you are facing. May I please know when will you be able to watch the videos?
8/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 78 218 5787: Is there any other document that you have sir besides the youtube videos because the network is bad don’t you have anything like pdf that contain the information in the videos
8/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand Delane, what you are trying to say. But We, at Edoofa, believe that visual representation is far superior in delivering the essence of the proposed program to its students and encouraging them to have a correct mindset toward their admission process. <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 11:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are able to understand what we are trying to convey? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 218 5787: Okay sir l understand

9/1/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Delane and Parents!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful morning.
Let us start with our session for today.
9/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 218 5787: Morning sir
9/1/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you?
9/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 218 5787: Right now l am at  school l wasn’t able to watch them
9/1/24, 8:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Delane.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Delane will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Delane is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 8:46 PM - +263 78 218 5787: Hie how are your sir noted soo l think we maybe be able to connect from 11 o clock to 12 o’clock if that ok with you
9/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 218 5787: So l went through this first video and the most 2 important things are to follow instructions and to be open  minded sir
