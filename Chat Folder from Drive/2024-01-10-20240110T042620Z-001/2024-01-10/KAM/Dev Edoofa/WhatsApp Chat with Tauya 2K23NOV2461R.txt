19/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
19/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 77 857 3328: In relation to video number 3 is it possible for us to know the names of some of the universities you applied for me to acquire my high quality education
19/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Firstly it was clearly stated that, one should be quick in getting all the formalities done to avoid any delays and also to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for us was also mentioned which is for us to get a high quality education and be leaders of tommorow. One of the videos explained about the schools and universities in this program where we are able to acquire our high quality education for which it was mentioned they are all high standard universities and lastly the preparation for interactive sessions with schools
19/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are associated with multiple universities it will be hard for me to get a track of them. How ever you will be provided with multiple offer letters and you can get to know the list of them. May I know if you are clear with me?
19/12/23, 8:08 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes I agree a
19/12/23, 8:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/12/23, 8:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
19/12/23, 8:40 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

20/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 857 3328: *Question 2:the scope and importance of medical laboratory technology*
The scope of med lab technology is as follows:firstly there is cross matching blood for transfusion. There's monitoring affected person outcomes and testing blood for drug levels and finding abnormalities. There's also operating lab equipment such as microscopes and cell counters and logging test data into patients medical records. They can also analyse body fluids, tissues and cells. They also management of medical lab technicians and assistance. They also work very closely with the scientists in diagnosis and monitoring disease processes. They also monitor patient outcomes and relay test results to physicians. Behind every medical test result and diagnosis is the work of a medical laboratory scientist
20/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 857 3328: *Question 3
What is good lab practice and why is it followed in the lab*
It is a set of guidelines that govern the process, organisation and conditions under which laboratory studies are conducted. Good lab practice is defined by principles that provide a framework within which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded and achieved. It is required to avoid mistakes and make sure everyone Is following the same rules. This then leads to the production of accurate and quality data that can be used in the development of drugs to prevent and fight human diseases. An example of GLP is the lab should be at the correct temperature, there should be enough work space and staff should wear the correct lab clothing
20/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 77 857 3328: *Question 4
Kindly mention different sterilization methods used in the lab, why they are important, explain any one of them in detail.*

The different sterilization methods include: ionizing radiation,dry-heat sterilizers, liquid chemicals, perfomic acid, filtration, microwave, glass bead sterilizer, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and lastly high pressure steam. They are important for ensuring that medical and surgical instruments do not transmit infectious pathogens to patients. Dry-heat sterilization typically involves exposing an item to a temperature of 170 degrees celcius under normal air pressure for around an hour. That time period ensures that even the most resistant spores get killed off via oxidation of their cellular componemts
20/12/23, 2:28 PM - +263 77 857 3328: _*Question 5
Explain a few techniques for placing samples under a microscope*_

The few techniques include dry mount, wet mount, smear slide and lastly the squash slide. Dry mount is a method by which the specimen is placed on with or without a cover slip over it. This method is for viewing dry specimen such as hair or pollen. Wet mount is placed on a drop of water on the slide, with a cover slip placed over it. This is often used for viewing cells. A smear is a sample that is spread across a slide and allowed to dry. A cover slip may be used in this type of preparation. This technique is used in viewing blood samples and lastly the squash slide which is used for viewing body fluids.

20/12/23, 6:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tauya!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Good evening to you all.  Yes proceed
20/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Evening sir. Yes we may proceed
20/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction? <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Yes we're aware of the remaining balance and  we  assure you that we will meet the given date to pay the balance
20/12/23, 7:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes its accurate
20/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 8:23 PM - +263 77 238 3967: I am not aware but it will be wise if the management team help us with the planning
20/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.
20/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
20/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
20/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:30 PM - +263 77 238 3967: It's  true we wish the same
20/12/23, 8:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tauya!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Evening to you too! We can proceed
21/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Evening sir. Yes we may proceed
21/12/23, 7:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 7:09 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Yes
21/12/23, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:25 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Yes
21/12/23, 7:25 PM - +263 77 857 3328: OK its fine by me
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 8:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes we agree
21/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 77 238 3967: We agree
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 77 238 3967: If i may ask? Is it possible to know the expenses we will spend on visa and travelling  expenses to india.  I think it is  also wise to consider that
21/12/23, 8:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, the VISA fee will be $83 and the plane ticket will be from $400 to $600
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:00 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Thank you and same to you
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 77 857 3328: We've been doing okay and you?
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Good evening.  We're okay and how are you doing
28/12/23, 7:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 8:59 AM - +263 77 238 3967: Morning. Sorry for yesterday  network was down
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Good evening to you. Tauya will be available at 7pm
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait for the same.
29/12/23, 7:06 PM - +263 77 857 3328: We may proceed
29/12/23, 7:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/12/23, 7:09 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Yes
29/12/23, 7:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/12/23, 7:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/12/23, 7:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/12/23, 7:36 PM - +263 77 857 3328: Fine by me
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 77 238 3967: Yes. Well explained
29/12/23, 8:12 PM - +27 84 562 0537: Good evening, thank you so much for all your work and clear explanation on the subject hear by on discussion. Sorry to bring you a bit back, I did not meet the deadline on paying the balance of $150, I was bit tied up with work because of the festive period. May you please advise on what I should do to deposit the money and whether I should deposit into the same account which I paid my first payment.
29/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, you are requested to make the payment on the previous account.
29/12/23, 8:35 PM - +27 84 562 0537: May you please confirm how much money I must  pay in South African Rand equivalent to $150.
29/12/23, 8:41 PM - +27 84 562 0537: May you please forgive me for taking you off your today's subject
29/12/23, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright that would be 2,741.23 South African Rand
29/12/23, 9:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 10:15 PM - +27 84 562 0537: Thank you so much, wish you a happy new year and stay blessed always
29/12/23, 10:21 PM - +27 84 562 0537: <Media omitted>

3/1/24, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
