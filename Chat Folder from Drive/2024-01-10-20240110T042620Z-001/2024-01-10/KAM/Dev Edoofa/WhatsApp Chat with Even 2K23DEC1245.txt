For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 3:26 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yea we can
27/12/23, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I have
27/12/23, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 3:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes they are
27/12/23, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 3:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am following
27/12/23, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 3:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes they are clear
27/12/23, 3:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
27/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 78 988 6123: I think  that this is great and I have no queries
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes we can
27/12/23, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 4:02 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes you may
27/12/23, 4:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

27/12/23, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/12/23, 4:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Even, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

27/12/23, 4:07 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Maybe in the midnight  because  the network  will be running smoothly
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay Even, I completely understand. But I wanted to reiterate that our operational hours are from *8 am to 4pm CAT*. So please choose a time slot between these available timings.

28/12/23, 1:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
28/12/23, 1:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

28/12/23, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
28/12/23, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Okay thank you
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this!
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am
28/12/23, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
28/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Okay sir
29/12/23, 10:55 AM - +263 77 266 9217: Morning everyone
29/12/23, 1:04 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Afternoon  sir
29/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 77 266 9217: For Even Prosper Mahlekete recommendation letter, I called the Head ofthw school and said thwta they are closed. They will open offices on 04 January 2024.
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 77 266 9217: Mutanda Gutu High Head.vcf (file attached)
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 77 266 9217: His contact

29/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 78 988 6123: 2.To be a successful aerospace engineer, you'll need a variety of technical and soft skills. On the technical side, you'll need strong math and science skills, including calculus, physics, and aerodynamics. You'll also need to be able to use CAD and CAE software, as well as other engineering software. In terms of soft skills, you'll need to be creative, detail-oriented, and a good problem solver. You'll also need strong communication skills, both written and verbal. And finally, you'll need to be a team player, since most aerospace projects involve collaboration with other engineers and specialists. Does that cover everything
29/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 78 988 6123: 3. To put it simply, aerodynamics is used in aerospace engineering to design aircraft and spacecraft that can safely and efficiently navigate through the air. Aerodynamicists use fluid mechanics to understand how air flows around an object, and then use this information to optimize the design of that object. This can involve reducing drag, improving lift, and ensuring stability. Additionally, aerodynamics is used to design efficient engines, control surfaces, and other components. The goal is to create aircraft and spacecraft that are safe, efficient, and meet performance requirements.
29/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 78 988 6123: 4. One of the most common lift augmentation devices used in aircraft is the winglet. A winglet is a small vertical extension at the end of a wing, and it can be used to reduce drag and increase lift. Another common device is the flap, which is a hinged section of the wing that can be lowered to increase the camber and, therefore, increase lift. Finally, ailerons are hinged control surfaces on the wings that are used to control the roll of the aircraft. These are just a few examples of the many devices used to increase lift on aircraft.
29/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 78 988 6123: 5.There are four main areas of aviation that are important to understand. The first is aerodynamics, which is the study of how air flows around an aircraft and how it affects the aircraft's performance. The second is flight dynamics, which is the study of how an aircraft moves through the air. The third is aircraft design, which is the process of creating an aircraft that meets specific requirements. And finally, the fourth area is aircraft operations, which includes everything from takeoff and landing to maintenance and safety. Each of these areas is crucial to aviation.

4/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 988 6123: We are doing good  sir
4/1/24, 9:01 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know!
4/1/24, 9:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for providing the academic documents and completing the tasks. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
4/1/24, 9:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you were scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2nd January).
But since it was a festive season, we were not able to actively connect and complete the processes timely.

So now your EWYL commencement date is 5th January 2024.
4/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Ok that's great news sir thank you
4/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
4/1/24, 9:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope that you have take a note of this?
4/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I have sir
4/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Ok
4/1/24, 9:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
4/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do
4/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/LpYR7gB4NvvHbxRmOO7S2L

4/1/24, 9:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for noticing this, Even. I have now edited the message with the whatsapp group link, you can now join the group! <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Ok thank you sir
4/1/24, 9:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great!
4/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 77 266 9217: We are fine. Am in a meeting but will be popping in to see how the process goes by
4/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 266 9217: I did join
4/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, Mr. Mahlekete.
4/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: It's great to know that.
5/1/24, 1:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Even!
How are you all doing?
5/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 988 6123: They are doing great sir
How are you doing
5/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 988 6123: I have got in touch with my mentor and she is a  woman her name is Aditi kapoor
5/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine as well. Thanks for asking.
5/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great !
5/1/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start our session?
5/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes we can
5/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
5/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/1/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yea I do remember and will pay sit before the due date
5/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 988 6123: That's great sir
5/1/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
5/1/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes it is accurate
5/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
5/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Ok that's  great
5/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am
5/1/24, 2:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
5/1/24, 2:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
5/1/24, 2:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
5/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
5/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
5/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I saw them and it is indeed
5/1/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I would  appreciate that
5/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I do agree
5/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 3:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am able to see it
6/1/24, 8:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Even and Parents!
I hope all of you are doing great.

There was technical Glitch due to which, we were not able to take forward our conversation. Shall we start with our session now?
6/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes  we can start
6/1/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I please know if you were completely able to understand our conversation yesterday?
6/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes 

I did but I wld lyk to know hw it works
6/1/24, 9:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Even! I am going to explain it further in our conversation.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: But, First I would like you to understand the below messages again:
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Okay that would appreciate that
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Ok
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/1/24, 9:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am able to
6/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes that's right
6/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
6/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes I would like that
6/1/24, 9:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 20, 2023.
6/1/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
6/1/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 78 988 6123: What is the due date
6/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes am wondering
6/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
6/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Well I think it's great
6/1/24, 9:48 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes it is
6/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/1/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Okay that is really  great
6/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Yes it have
6/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Maybe tomorrow  will be done
6/1/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: Since, tomorrow is a Sunday, we will not be able to go forward with our session. We will connect on Monday for further conversation.
6/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 988 6123: Okay that is great
6/1/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Have a wonderful day ahead!
7/1/24, 12:24 AM - +263 77 266 9217: Am making a follow up an getting everything correct
