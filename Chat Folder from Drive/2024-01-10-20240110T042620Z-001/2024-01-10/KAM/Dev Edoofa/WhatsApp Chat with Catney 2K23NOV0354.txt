29/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Understood
29/12/23, 4:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Let's schedule for the January second
29/12/23, 4:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that can be done.
