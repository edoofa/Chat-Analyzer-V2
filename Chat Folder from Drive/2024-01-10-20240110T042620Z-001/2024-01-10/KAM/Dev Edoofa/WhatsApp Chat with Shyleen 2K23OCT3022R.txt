29/12/23, 4:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Shyleen

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 71 554 0651: We're fine thanks and how are you doing.
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 78 909 8049: we are fine, how about you
29/12/23, 4:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking. If you are ready shall we now proceed with the session with the admission porcess?
29/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Yes please
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: We are blessed thank you and how are you doing
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we can proceed
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we do
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes sir ,but I want to know if we still continue deposing on the same account number or?
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We can also share you with multiple account options for that. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 336 8037: I'm Shyleen' s mom sir I'm the one asking we have already discussed and since it's end of the month I wanted to know if we can continue depositing on that account number that we have

29/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Okay thanks we will continue with the one that we have thank you🙏
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
