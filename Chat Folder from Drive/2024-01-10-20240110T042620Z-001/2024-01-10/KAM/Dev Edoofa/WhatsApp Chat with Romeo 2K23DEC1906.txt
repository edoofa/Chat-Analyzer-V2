Iam born second in a happy and united family being six altogether including parents. 
All my siblings are in school with the support of our parents who are both formerly employed. 
My parents are the ones who encouraged me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program and promised to sponsor and support my academic carrier.
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing about yourself. It's great to hear about your academic journey and aspirations. Your family sounds wonderfully supportive and cohesive, which is a significant asset in any educational endeavor. Being the second-born in a family of six and having all your siblings also engaged in their studies showcases a strong emphasis on education in your family.

The fact that your parents are both formerly employed and still prioritize and support your and your siblings' education speaks volumes about their dedication to your futures.
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate.

28/12/23, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Romeo 2K23DEC1906)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Romeo EWYL23E1088)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/12/23, 1:19 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm clear
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
28/12/23, 1:31 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Ok thank you. To me so far the whole process is clear and consistent. The counselor highlighted all the six steps of the Edoofa Scholarship program from counseling, eligibility check test upto Admission and Visa.

28/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 78 413 4114: The EWYL Program is also helpful to us students in that it equips us with the necessary skills and knowledge for our areas of specialisation. It also reduces the burden on tuition fees through credits.

I have known Mr. Kunal for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm ready

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have consulted school authorities and they advised me that such letters maybe available after opening of school (9 January 2024)

2/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263784134114 I completely understand that these challenges can be a hurdle, but I want to emphasize that we haven't managed to engage in a proper discussion. It's vital that we commence our discussion to initiate the admission process, especially if you're aiming to begin the EWYL program on January 5th. I've observed that your peers have progressed beyond the initial forms, with several already finalizing their admission. These hold-ups could result in you lagging behind your peers. Therefore, I would encourage you to participate in the process proactively so that we can move ahead with the forms and your EWYL program can be started on the same day when your batch starts.
2/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I kindly appreciate your advice and encouragement on my proactive participation during the admission phase. I have much hope that the forms are to be completed today.

2/1/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I appreciate that you have considered being proactive. I shall wait for your response at 08:00 pm today regarding the forms.

2/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form, it is duly noted with us. I was going through your EWYL pledge from however, you have not mentioned the EWYL availability date and the orientation date may I know if you did not understand the question well?
2/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have read and understood the question, however my challenge with the EWYL availability date of 5 January is that I will be home in the country side where I usually reside during holidays and internet connectivity is not always reliable where as during school term I will be at school where we use the school's Wi-fi which is more reliable. Our school term begins 9 January 2024. In this case I need to be guided accordingly.
2/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263784134114. I appreciate you keeping me informed here, before filling in the form. In that case, we have a second EWYL batch on the 9th of January may I know if that will be suitable for you?
2/1/24, 8:42 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes it will be suitable
2/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, please update the date in your EWYL pledge form and your orientation date is the next day followed.
2/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 78 413 4114: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 8:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the updated form, it is noted with us. may I know if you were able to fill out the student application form by now?

With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
3/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We are doing great
3/1/24, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm available .You can go on
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm ready . We may start
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm done
3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes I'm following
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: We may start
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 413 4114: You may move forward
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
3/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I may be through with them at 5 :00 pm
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for your response.
3/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I'm through . we may continue
3/1/24, 4:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so could you please share your understanding about the 4 videos?
3/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Students should be teachable and open minded and we should follow instructions
3/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I learnt that Edoofa ' s vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through SEELS but also focused on increasing students capacity for success thus making student more responsible and independent
3/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I learnt that we as students understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify good schools ,colleges and universities .Our founders encourage us to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious instructions
3/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 413 4114: I have learnt that the statement of purpose is an important document ,we as students should be prompt in taking action and be deligent in filling out the form
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Thanks for further clarification
3/1/24, 5:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Yes we are on the same page
3/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
3/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1, I shall wait for your response to the remaining questions.
4/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Primary memory is called "the main memory",and is a critical part of a computer's functioning.It is where data is temporarily stored  and  accessed while the computer is functioning only but the data temboralily stored can be lost when the computer is turned off.This means that it is volatile.There are two main parts of primary memory which are R.A.M (read only memory) and the cache memory .R.A.M is the main working memory of a computer .it's used to store data for the programs and process currently running .Cache memory is a type of RAM that is used to store recently accessed data for quick retrival .ROM is non volatile but falls under primary storage because it is directly accessed by the CPU.it is used to store the operating system of a computer or the other important programs that need to be preserved even when the computer is turned off .Secondary storage is also called" non volatile storage" ,is a type of storage that is used to store data for long term .Unlike primary memory ,secondary memory is persistent,which means that the data is stored even when the computer is turned off .Examples include Hard drives ,solid state disks(SSDs),optical disks and flash drives.In addition primary memory is directly accessed by the CPU and secondary memory is accesed through input/output (I/O) devices.
4/1/24, 8:09 PM - +263 78 413 4114: The open systems interconnection model is a theoretical framework that describes how the computer networks communicate with each other .It is broken down into seven layers ,each of each has a specific role in the communication process .At the bottom is the physical layer ,which deals with the actual physical connections between devices for example the HDMI cable ,which is used to connect devices like TVs and game consoles to each other .The next layer is the data link layer ,which manages the flow of data across networks .Then there is the network layer ,which handles routing and addressing .After that the transport layer ,which enables reliable communication between devices .The session layer manages communication sessions between devices so that they can understand each other and finally the application layer is the topmost layer that handles actual applications that users interact with for examble web browsers ,email instant messaging all fall under the application layer.These layers work together to create a cohesive network architecture that allows different devices to communicate with each other .It is important to note that not all networks follow the OSI model exactly for example internet doesn't have a well defined presentation layer.
4/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Operator overloading is a feature of some computer languages that alows operators like +,-,and * to have different meanings depending on the types of values they're operating on .For example in C+++,the + operator can be used to add numbers together ,concatenate strings ,or combine two objects together . In java the plus operator is only used for string concentration .In python ,the plus operator can be used for addition concatenation and object combination .let me go more deeper in each language .In python ,the plus operator can be used to add a value to a variable and also concatenate strings .For example ,you could write a statement like x+=2 to add 2 to a value of x and store the result back in x .You could also write a statement like"hello"+"world" to create the string "hello world" .In C+++ operator overloading is more powerful than in java or python .In addition to defining the behavior of operators like +,-,and * ,you can also define the behavior of the call operator +(()) and the assignment operator (=) .This means that you can create your custom functions and assignment operators of your choice .In Java operator overloading allows you to create multiple methods with the same name ,but different behavior ,based on the context in which they are called operating overloading is not supported for all operators in java ,for example the  ==and!= operators cannot be overloaded .
4/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 78 413 4114: Technology can help a country's economy in a number of ways including:
Productivity 
- Technology can make production process more efficient , allowing businesses to produce more goods and services with same amount of labor .For example robots can be used to perform repetitive tasks on an assembly line ,increasing efficiency and reducing the need of manual labor.
Access to global markets 
- technology can help connect businesses to markets all over the world ,allowing them to reach a wider customer base .For example Platforms like amazon and Alilaba have made it easier for business to sell their products to customers all over the world .
Government efficiency
- technology can help streamline government processes ,making it easier for citizens to access services and government and provide small benefits .One example of this is the use of blockchain technology .Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that can be used to create secure ,transparent and amper- proof records.
Financial inclusion 
-  technology can help provide access to financial services such as banking and insurance to more people . Mobile banking is a great example of how technology can increase financial inclusion .Technology enabled financial inclusion ,on the other hand can be accessed by anyone with a mobile phone .In conclusion Technology can also help to promote sustainability by reducing amount of energy needed to power up lives .
