19/12/23, 7:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet thank you , we can proceed
19/12/23, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 7:28 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is accurate Mr Shivjeet
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/12/23, 7:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 8:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.
19/12/23, 9:00 PM - +263 77 623 2165: I definitely agree with Edoofa Financial Secure Plan it is the backbone for parents /students
19/12/23, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 7:55 PM - +263 77 623 2165: How are you Mr Shivjeet sorry for the late reply, am ready for the session
21/12/23, 8:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above vidoes?
21/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
21/12/23, 8:21 PM - +263 77 623 2165: What I have understood after watching the videos is that the student should follow instructions and listen to experts as well as the elevation of levels when the co-founder illustrated a cup and a tank holding different capacity of water. Also learnt that the co-founders play a parental role in ensuring students there get quality education by enrolling them in the best schools, colleges and universities. In the universities the Edoofa program provides EWYL in those universities ensuring that the student is able to master the concepts of being independent and hard work which will later pay off when they attain their degree and they pursue their desired career which will make them  different from the other students who did not do their internship through the EWYL program. And the Edoofa program is there to empower the vision of the students and facilitating the education system which will later pay off when there acquire their degrees.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:03 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Same to you Mr Shivjeet thank you so much
27/12/23, 7:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Panashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:10 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet how are you
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
27/12/23, 8:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.

I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/12/23, 9:02 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Sorry for saying this but I believe we did the session some days ago Mr Shivjeet
27/12/23, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/12/23, 6:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet thank you

28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:45 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Dully noted
29/12/23, 9:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 8:27 AM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you for the best wishes Mr Shivjeet

3/1/24, 5:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I was not available by the time you connected as it was past my available hours. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am available Mr Shivjeet
4/1/24, 9:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
4/1/24, 11:11 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you for the update Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:32 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Am okay thank you Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are currently available for a session?
5/1/24, 6:33 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet we can proceed
5/1/24, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am sharing you with the Edoofa secure plan for now.
5/1/24, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 6:41 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes we do
5/1/24, 6:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 7:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 7:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I agree Mr Shivjeet thank you
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet that's right
5/1/24, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/1/24, 8:16 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet please do
5/1/24, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/1/24, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 10:34 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Yes i am Mr Shivjeet
6/1/24, 12:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents of Panashe,

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Mr. Dev,* who will connect with you on Monday.  I hope you will make yourself available for the further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 623 2165: Thank you so much same applies with you Mr Shivjeet
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
