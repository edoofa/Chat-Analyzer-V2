19/12/23, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Yvonne. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Yes, it has been a while now. How are you doing today?
19/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 78 777 9202: I'm doing great thank you, how're you yourself?
19/12/23, 6:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. How are your family doing today as we are approaching this year's Christmas.
19/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 78 777 9202: They're all doing just fine ....

And yes, about Christmas we're enthusiastically waiting for the day of the Celebrations😊
29/12/23, 4:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Yvonne

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 78 777 9202: It is alright, we understand!
We're doing great thank you, how about you?
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 5:02 PM - +263 78 777 9202: Yes l am ready
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 5:07 PM - +263 78 777 9202: The admission process will proceed for 10 months
And in the 11th month we'll be guided to open an FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150 for smooth application of the visa as the Embassy will ask for a bank statement
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

3/1/24, 6:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

9/1/24, 9:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
