Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Well, thank you 
We were very impressed by the way that Edoofa scholarship program was presented by Mr Shashwat .
To be honest we had no idea that the Edoofa scholarship program existed in this world but all thanks to Mr Shashwat he has been very professional.
He highlighted the cost of education in India which is $6000-$8000 because of the scholarship the education fee is reduced to $1200-$1800 which is a huge relief to parents and guardians.
In addition to that he mentioned the EWYL program which further discounts the fee.
Lastly the scholarship enriches the student with skills of  being employable.

Thank you
27/12/23, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have known Mr. Shashwat for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.

28/12/23, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Noted with thanks, yes we can proceed Sir.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Noted
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir, well elaborated
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Quite clear Sir
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 77 382 1026: I understand it clearly
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir, we are on the same page
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Let me understand on the registration fee of $500 to $1000 is this additional to the $350 that was paid already?
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Chando. To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000.
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 77 382 1026: That's ok understood. Thank you
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Yes we can proceed with the discussion Sir
28/12/23, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

28/12/23, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Leah, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 78 536 5920: All received but our internet is not that smooth so it might take time to see the videos and summarize them 
If possible can we schedule our next session for tomorrow.
Thank you.

They build some substances and break others down. All living things have enzymes. Our bodes naturally produce enzymes. 

Enzyme activity is the rate at which an enzyme catalyses, or speeds up a a reaction. 

There are a number of factors that affect enzyme activity, these include temperature, pH or acidity, concentration of enzymes, concentration of substrates and the presence of inhibitors and activators.

Enzymes work best at specific temperatures and if the temperature is too high or too low the enzyme will become denatured and stop working.

Enzymes also have an optimal pH and if the pH is too high or too low the enzyme will denature. 

If there are too few enzymes, the reaction will proceed slowly. On the other hand if there are too many enzymes they will start to compete for substrates and the reaction will proceed more slowly. 

The concentration of substrates also affects enzyme activity, if there are too few substrates, the enzyme will not be able to find wnough of them to react on.


Lastly inhibitors and activators, inhibitors a slow down enzyme activity while activators increase it.

We are doing great

5/1/24, 8:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing great as well. Thank you for asking, Leah.
5/1/24, 8:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: So shall we move ahead with our session?
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes we can move ahead
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Good morning sir
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes Sir
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.

5/1/24, 8:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 536 5920: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 10:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for providing us with the receipt of the payment. I have taken a note of it and will update it with our accounts team as well.
So shall we move ahead with our conversation?
5/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes we can
5/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes
5/1/24, 10:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biotechnology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir it is very accurate 
Thank you
5/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
5/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/1/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir
5/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are eager to learn more about the details of this plan. I am going to brief it in the below points.
5/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
5/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
5/1/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
5/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
5/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes, it is something we would want as a family 
Thank you
5/1/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes please
Thank you
5/1/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes I agree
5/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir it’s clear <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes I agree
5/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
5/1/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/1/24, 10:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir
5/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes
5/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir
5/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes
5/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me explain. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
5/1/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Well understood
5/1/24, 11:00 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you
5/1/24, 11:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad that you are able to follow. This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s wonderful sir, indeed it will ease the financial burden
5/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes it is
5/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/1/24, 11:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/1/24, 11:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Can I ask
5/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mrs Chando. Absolutely.
5/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Thank you
5/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 821 9098: So how much is the flight from here to there
5/1/24, 12:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: So, Mrs. Chando, the fare of flight tickets varies according to multiple factors. It totally depends on when the flight is being booked, which airlines you have chosen, etc. But the average fare of the flight tickets is around $400-$600. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 12:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also at the time of VISA process, our team is going to guide you with the flight tickets according to your convenience and help you grab the most affordable flight.
5/1/24, 12:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope I was able to clear your query.
5/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes
5/1/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you
5/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Okay thank you for that
5/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes
5/1/24, 1:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome.
5/1/24, 1:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now coming back to the financial secure plan, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir, you explained quite clearly
Thank you
5/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
5/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Well thank you 
I think we are going to have the discussion today after mother comes back from work at night
5/1/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
5/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Thank you so much sir for the wonderful session.

Thank you , wishing you a wonderful day ahead of you as well

9/1/24, 10:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Leah!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day yesterday, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session today at 2:30 pm so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track.
9/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 821 9098: Good morning sir we are doing well and noted
9/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good afternoon sir , sorry for the late response I was at school
