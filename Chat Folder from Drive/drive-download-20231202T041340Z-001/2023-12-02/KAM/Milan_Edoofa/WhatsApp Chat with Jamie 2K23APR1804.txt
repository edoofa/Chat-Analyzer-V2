03/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l am
03/10/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
03/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Well what l understood about the registration process is that it's from $500-$750 depending on which university you are interested in and that you are going to help us in looking for which universities have scholarship for Jamie's choice of course
03/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you l appreciate the support you're going to give us and we're really excited for this next step.We look forward to receiving the offer letter/s from the University .
03/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

03/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
03/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l have read through we can discuss them
03/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
03/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
03/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Are there cases where you receive more than one offer letter
04/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and My dear student.. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
04/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Good afternoon to you.Am available you can proceed
04/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l have understood
04/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 550 2050: And that's a great benefit
04/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
04/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Do l have to do something to qualify for the $150 grant
04/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No you do not you are currently qualified for the grant.
04/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear do that we can furthe proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 550 2050: That's awesome
04/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes we can go ahead
04/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes the details are clear.
04/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
04/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Can you please explain how our scholarship will be assessed
04/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. Although one could increase their scholarship percentage based on the marks they score on their A-level. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
04/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes am now clear
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l can see the benefits of the Endowment Plan
04/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 550 2050: So when the A-level results are out and they are favourable how do l get the University to re evaluate the percentage of the scholarship
04/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 550 2050: And from what points are  favourable results
04/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
04/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you good evening
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Greetings we are well how are you
05/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes am ready sorry did not hear your message coming in
05/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. Although one could increase their scholarship percentage based on the marks they score on their A-level. I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
05/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Okay l understand
05/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you clear so that we can proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 550 2050: So will the  A-level results be requested for in future
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Or we just submit them to you when they're out
05/10/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, you will be required to submit the A level when it is released.
05/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Okay, we can proceed
05/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 550 2050: I don't understand how number 3 is a benefit
05/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will help you understand. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l am and it's sure is a benefit
05/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes thank you that's good
05/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you have a great weekend
09/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Good afternoon to you yes we may continue
09/10/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Is it like reimbursing the enrollment fee and registration fee.Will you be doing the EWYL for a year to reimburse
09/10/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it is and it depends on your consistency for the amount to be reached. So, may I know if you are clear here ?
09/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes am clear we can go ahead
09/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Jamie's uardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Jamie is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes am really excited to get this opportunity to benefit from Edoofa program as well as the Endowment program.yes am looking forward to the next steps.
09/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Jamie's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you very much,l appreciate it and look forward to a bright educational future for Jamie.
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jamie.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Hie is 1130am okay tomorrow,0930 will be in church
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jamie!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 550 2050: Yes have gone through the letter
15/10/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 550 2050: Morning 1.$900
2.3 years
3.$300
4.$750
15/10/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 550 2050: Yes it's clear
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 550 2050: So for the $800 option it's accomodations and then you buy your own food and cooking facilities.where is the difference between the $800 and $1200
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the accommodation costs of $800, this costs includes your rent as well it also factors in the cost of food where in you would either be choosing outside meals or you would have to self-cook for yourself.

Coming to the difference between the $800 and $1200 accommodation options, in the second option, the university officials will help you in the accommodation and will take care of all the responsibilities included with the same for the entire couse duration.

However, when it comes to the first option, the university officials won't be included in the same, however, the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will assist you in finding the same please. I hope this is clear now?
16/10/23, 5:38 am - +263 77 550 2050: I get the picture now.We can go ahead
16/10/23, 5:42 am - +263 77 550 2050: Sorry about the fever l wish you a quick recovery
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes we are
16/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 322 6650: Apologize she was hacked
16/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, please, I understand. May I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Jamie!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Jamie!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 550 2050: How are you sorry my WhatsApp had been disconnected.
20/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Can you please stop processing Jamie's application for now he is uncomfortable with going forward so am trying to find out where his problem is.
20/10/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand. On that note, can you please help me in understanding the reason why is it that Jamie is not comfortable in moving ahead with the admission process?
20/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 550 2050: He might have some fears of going abroad.Or he's not made up his mind of what he really wants to do with his future.Will find out more when he finishes his exam.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, if I may ask has he mentioned this to you that he is scared about coming to India for his studies?
21/10/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 550 2050: When he came for holiday in August that's when he mentioned some students with relatives studying in India were not speaking favourably about living there and he said he did not want to go there anymore.He also said he was thinking of switching to accounting.As a parent l still thought coming to India was still the best option so l persisted with moving ahead with the Edoofa procedures but when l visited him just two weeks ago he had not changed his mind that's why l thought maybe l should stop for now until he comes back from school and we can reassess the situation.I had asked Saloni  if l could talk to other Zimbabwean students there but she said l bring the matter to you
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 5:43 am - +263 77 550 2050: How are you? Hope you enjoyed the holiday
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 09:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 550 2050: Am now ready sorry for the delay
25/10/23, 10:43 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. How are you doing today?
25/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 550 2050: Am good thank you
25/10/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. Now, I appreciate your understanding and it's good to hear that you're ready to continue our discussion. I completely understand Jamie's concerns and your desire to reassess the situation based on his preferences.

Regarding the students Jamie mentioned who had concerns about studying in India, we value the feedback and concerns of everyone. However, it's important to mention that we have a diverse group of Edoofians studying in India from various countries, and we haven't specifically received any such feedback from them yet. I hope you understand?
25/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 550 2050: Am pleased to hear that.I just spoke to a student Valerie and she really reassured me by her response however Jamie is the one who has to do this journey of his life and l thought it would be best for him to talk to Valerie about his specific concerns.That would be a month from now.
25/10/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: It's great to hear that you've had a reassuring conversation with Valerie, and I agree that Jamie's concerns are valid. Having a discussion with someone who has had a similar experience can be very helpful. However, I'd like to highlight an important aspect to consider.

The scholarships and Endowment Benefits that have been secured for Jamie are time-sensitive. We have a due date i.e. 28th October, and if we wait until Jamie is available to have this conversation with Valerie, it might be too late. By that time, the scholarship seats and benefits might no longer be accessible, and Jamie could potentially miss out on this opportunity.
25/10/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: I understand that Jamie's comfort and well-being are paramount, and we want him to make an informed decision. However, it's essential to balance that with securing the scholarship and benefits that have been allocated to him. We don't want him to miss out on a great opportunity for his higher education. I believe you would agree to that, right?
25/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l am aware of that.So what options are there for him after the 28th of October?
25/10/23, 11:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for understanding the urgency. After the 28th of October, securing the same scholarship and benefits may become impossible, since the university would have revoked the offer letter by then. I hope you understand that?
25/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l understand that but l have no choice at the moment other than waiting for him or else we will pay money and he will not go.
25/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 550 2050: Is it ok to make suggestions for  where we might prefer him to go
25/10/23, 12:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your perspective as a concerned parent. However, losing the scholarship just while waiting for Jamie to connect with us does not seem like a wise decision to me, please. Moving ahead, being a parent and Jamie's guardians, it becomes our responsibility to make him understand things, right?
25/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes how much is needed now
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I would like to mention that for now, only the registration fee would be required in order to complete the admission process please? I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 550 2050: It is clear.Am sorry we not ready now am not sure what course of action to take and l wanted more options in choosing a university
25/10/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, are you aware how the admission process of a student is carried out please?
25/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Can you please clarify it for me
25/10/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
25/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 550 2050: What will you be considering when you talk about university's ranking and affordability in relation to the student
25/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly, when we talk about a university's ranking, it's to ensure that our students receive a top-quality education. A university with a higher ranking is often indicative of a better academic reputation, quality of faculty, research opportunities, and a strong support system for students.

On the other hand, affordability is also an essential consideration. We want to ensure that the financial requirements of the university are in line with the preparations made by our students and their families. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Okay l understand
25/10/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
25/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes am clear
25/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 550 2050: I fully understand now
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 550 2050: No, can you explain about the transfer option
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l understand
25/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you have proper clarity on how the admission process is carried out, right?
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l have
25/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since you have clarity on the same, can you please let me know how do you wish to move ahead with Jamie's admission?
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 550 2050: I would like to wait for an update from other universities that will possibly give me time to sort out Jamie's issues
02/11/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here. Moving ahead, can you please let me know what would be the right time for us to connect with each other here so that we can discuss more about Jamie's admission process please? <This message was edited>

06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:06 am - +263 77 550 2050: Okay thank you
07/11/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jamie!

07/11/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, if I may ask, were you able to research about Galgotias by now?
07/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 550 2050: There was a time when l went on the internet but l did not finish the research l just saw a bit like distance from a certain airport and that you use taxis to go there and it takes 1 hour and minutes.It seemed to be in a remote area
07/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 550 2050: And that it's a private university
08/11/23, 7:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Jamie!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 550 2050: We are doing well hope the same with you as well
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your initial observations about Galgotias. I appreciate your efforts in conducting some preliminary research. However, I'd like to clarify some points regarding Galgotias University.
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is not located in a remote area. In fact, it's situated in Greater Noida, a well-connected and developing region within the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. The university is easily accessible by various means of transportation, and it's not isolated or distant from essential facilities.

Furthermore, it's a vibrant and esteemed educational institution known for its diverse programs, modern facilities, and a conducive learning environment. Being a private university, it upholds high academic standards and offers a range of disciplines for students to explore and excel in. I hope this is understood, right?

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
