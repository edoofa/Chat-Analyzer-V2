25/10/23, 10:09 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Noted
25/10/23, 10:09 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Well noted
25/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.

25/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your MSCE Results, it is noted with us, may I know by when will you be able to share the remaining documents?
25/10/23, 10:15 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: We will contact the school for proper feedback
25/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available to connect with us.
25/10/23, 10:18 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Will be available
26/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok, noted
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and JCE results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Cuthbert, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: That's awesome news
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 4:09 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: It does. So since I am in this program, change of fees will not have any affect on my finances
26/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes, understood
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 4:20 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I think I get it. So if we pay the first installment ($300) before or on the day the deadline starts, this might lead to the chances of me getting the grant and the second part should be paid before the end date.
26/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are absolutely correct, however, this will only be possible if you will be able to share your academic documents on time.
26/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 4:37 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I am good to go
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 9:30 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I believe we can proceed
26/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 10:06 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I am so excited
26/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. However, we will prepare your application once you share all your documents. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/10/23, 10:12 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Thank you so much and we take note of early preparations
27/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Cuthbert,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, may I know if you have any updates to share regarding your documents?
28/10/23, 1:40 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Good afternoon Ms Kirti. I hope you are doing well. Are we continuing today as well?
30/10/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinevimbo.

I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend, kindly excuse me for not connecting on Saturday since we are not available on the weekends, since we were unable to continue our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 4:06 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Good afternoon Ms Kirti. This is not Tinevimbo it's Cuthbert. We can proceed
30/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that, as I was talking to my other students at the same time and I must have mixed the names.
30/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can proceed. May  I know if you have any updates to share regarding your documents?
30/10/23, 4:12 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: It's okay ma'am
30/10/23, 4:13 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: The schools has not responded on that yet.
30/10/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, I hope you understand you are delaying your application process because we can not share your application with universities as we do not have your documents this can affect your chances of getting a seat in the first batch, and there are also many students have reserved their seats, now 55 students have already secured their seats, leaving 45 positions available only.
30/10/23, 4:18 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Oh my gosh will do everything to get them
30/10/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please may I know by when can I expect an update from you regarding the documents? <This message was edited>

02/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning parents and Cuthbert.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting the JCE result. It is duly noted with us. Now we shall share your application with the universities. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
02/11/23, 1:14 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: We are very much interested and looking forward to the good news
13/11/23, 9:16 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Good morning Ms Kirti. How are you doing today? I just wanted to ask about the offer letter. Does the university send the letter to me or you will send it to me
14/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Cuthbert.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as we were not available on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world.

17/11/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
18/11/23, 6:03 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Good evening Ms Kirti. How are you doing
18/11/23, 6:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Cuthbert!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 6:22 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Thank you so much Mr Milan. It's such a privilege to connect with you tonight
18/11/23, 6:24 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I have gone through the offer and I had questions which you can clarify on
18/11/23, 6:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 6:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 6:31 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes that's an awesome idea. Let's proceed
18/11/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: 1. Tuition fee after scholarship per semester - 900USD
2. 5 Years (10 semesters)
3. Admission and procedure fee - 300USD
4. Registration fee -750 USD
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 6:50 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes I understand on that part
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: So we will decide any of the two choices:
1. On campus accommodation
2. Off campus accommodation
When we reach there or we decide now?
18/11/23, 7:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly! The decision regarding accommodation can be made either now or when you arrive at the university. Galgotias University offers flexibility in accommodation choices, allowing students to decide upon arrival or beforehand based on their preferences and circumstances.  I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:13 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes understood
18/11/23, 7:14 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: And if we are to choose the out of campus accommodation, are we to stay in the apartments alone or with a roommate?
18/11/23, 7:15 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: Which state is this University?
18/11/23, 7:23 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: How far is the campus from the out of campus residential area?
18/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: The type of accommodation for off-campus stays varies. Generally, university-approved off-campus accommodations offer sharing rooms where students share the living space with roommates. However, there could also be options for individual rooms, especially if students choose to independently find accommodations. I hope this is clear as well?
18/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Also, when it comes to the distance of the off campus accommodation facilities from the university campus, they all are situated near the campus at a walking distance. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I understand
18/11/23, 7:39 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Let's proceed
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 7:46 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes I understand. So far so good.
18/11/23, 7:48 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: So the ID's help with what?
18/11/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here. May you please come agian?
18/11/23, 8:08 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: What is the function of the ID or does the ID have a special function?
18/11/23, 8:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Here, I believe you are asking about the National ID, right?
18/11/23, 8:24 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: No, the student's ID?
18/11/23, 8:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, the student ID serves as official identification within the university campus. It grants access to various facilities and services offered by the university, such as library resources, entry to specific campus areas, borrowing books, accessing computer labs, and sometimes even for attendance purposes in classes.
18/11/23, 8:40 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: Great and understood
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 8:48 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: We're all good here
18/11/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 9:52 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I understand sir
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: Mr Millan apart from the registration fees which is due in 15 days being the first, which other payment comes next?

Are we allowed to pay by installments the rest of the fees?

How many installments if l may know?
18/11/23, 9:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing those queries with me here. Now, I have taken a note of your queries and stay assured that I will help you with them. However, now, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.

20/11/23, 8:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cuthbert!

20/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Everything is fine here. Go ahead.
20/11/23, 3:05 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: I do have a question regarding the registration fee, if I'm not mistaken reading earlier conversations you communicated that we needed to raise $300 but now our offer letter says $750. Could you elaborate more on why that is? 
Did we miss something along the lines of communication with you
20/11/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here. About that, I would like to mention that you have not missed anything here, the information that you have mentioned is completely right and we are coming to discuss that in the coming parts of our conversation. For now, as you are clear, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Yes please. That would be greatly appreciated
20/11/23, 4:13 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Is there anything else which is crucial that we should be informed about
20/11/23, 4:22 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: You have mentioned that my learning will start in September, so what connection will it make if I go in August?
20/11/23, 4:24 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Orientation is required I think that is why you go in August
20/11/23, 4:31 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok I get it now
20/11/23, 4:35 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: What about religious worship? I don't know if we are able to go church or are there any churches or churces of different denominatons?
20/11/23, 4:44 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Yes there should be.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cuthbert!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

21/11/23, 3:13 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Yes we can. 

That's okay, thanks for letting us know.
21/11/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before moving ahead, let me first answer your queries here. 

About your first query regarding the starting of Semester in September and arrival here in India in the month of August, yes, please dear it is true and the initial days will be utilized by the university officials for the Orientation Program
21/11/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Also, when it comes to the worship, yes, please dear, there are all the churches present in the nearby locations in the vicinity of the university campus. I hope this is understood?
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: This is good to know. I'm sure he will appreciate hearing about this.
21/11/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Yes clear on this till here. Since we are still talking about this I'm sure you will share more details as we move along.
21/11/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely! In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Yes please
21/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: We are sorry for not participating well today, the network is too bad here
21/11/23, 4:30 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: It has but please let's continue
21/11/23, 4:35 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Absolutely sir.
21/11/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now, Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 4:43 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Very clear. Thank you for clarifying this so much better
21/11/23, 4:46 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: The bank details are included in the offer letter right?
21/11/23, 4:48 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes they are. Below the offer letter
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please and we are coming to that as well. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I don't stay in Zimbabwe, there was a mistake there. I stay in Malawi
21/11/23, 5:05 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: We wanted your help in getting that fixed.
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: We will be making the deposit in USD
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, excuse me for the same please. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well? <This message was edited>

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
24/11/23, 6:13 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Hello Ms Kirti, thank you for connecting with us. 

Is it possible to get the offer letter revised to show the correct country for Chikumbutso? We would greatly appreciate if that gets taken care of please.

And to your question on discussing the letter yes we reviewed and continually discuss it actually.
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you earlier, as it was my dinner break, and thank you for sharing your concern regarding the letter, yes please we have informed the university about the same it was a clerical error, once we receive the updated letter we shall notify you please.

24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: We indeed are delighted of course for the opportunity. 

Most of our conversations are just surrounding how best to assist financially with my brothers studies at Galgotias. It is indeed a beautiful university per the pictures and videos provided which makes it more exciting that he is going to be at a great place. We will utilize the installment plans discussed with us to help along the way when needed. 

We are grateful for the EWL program, that is very helpful knowing it applies to the tuition and my brother is very determined to do his best and we will support his process fully. 

I also wanted to know when we make the payment to the account provided in the offer letter, should we let you know on here or will you know we made the payment from India right there? 

Also as far as outside accomodations, how do we help with that in terms of arranging payments? Are installments also applied there or is it just the tuition that has installment plans.
24/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing more about your discussions I am glad to see that you are excited about the offer letter. Let me help you understand your queries for your first concern, once you are done with your payment, you will be given a receipt and you will be required to share that receipt with us. So that we can update our accounts team. 

Now coming back to your second query yes please, monthly payments are allowed for off-campus accommodations, may I know if you are clear now?
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - +1 (380) 232-0188: Okay we are clear. Thank you 

So will we have another person to connect with on accomodations or will you walk with us throughout the entire time.
24/11/23, 8:52 pm - +265 882 45 58 72: We are together in whatever is taking place and promise to be until our son gets there.
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please there is a designated department for that and our team will be helping you once Cuthbert arrives in India.
