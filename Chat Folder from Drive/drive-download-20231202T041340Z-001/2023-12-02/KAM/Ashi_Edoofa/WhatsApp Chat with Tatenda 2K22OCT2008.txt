19/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 495 6142: May I ask this, tuition fee after scholarship is $900 and we paid $750 adjustable towards tuition fees,so it means $900-$750 which makes our tuition balance for the first semester $150,i hope we are agreeing on the same
19/08/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda,

I hope you are doing well, It is alright, let me help you with the breakup of your fee, As per your offer letter, your per-semester fee breakup is as below -
1. Tuition Fee - $900
2. Examination Fee - $100
19/08/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, when you add up all these components, your per semester cost of education that is due to the university becomes $900+ $100 = $1000
19/08/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Since you have already paid the registration fee of $750 through Edoofa to reserve your scholarship seat, the same amount has been adjusted towards your first semester's tuition fee. This leaves a remaining balance of $1000 - $750 = $250
19/08/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope I have cleared your doubt, do let me know if you have any confusion
19/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 495 6142: Thanks so much for the clarification,we are agreeing on the same
19/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 495 6142: It's done
19/08/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 495 6142: So is it compulsory that the examination fee be paid upon registration or there is room that it can be paid towards the exam
19/08/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 495 6142: Good evening
23/08/23, 10:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda,

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for not replying to concern earlier I was occupied with some other work. Let me help you now, The examination fees needs to be paid with your remaining fees as shared by the University. May I know if you have any other concern regarding the fees.

31/08/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tatenda,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past two days, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.
31/08/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am thrilled to hear the update on your visa from you. It's truly an impressive achievement, and we couldn't be more excited for you. Now that you have your visa, the next step for you is to book your flight tickets with the *arrival date of 6th of September*. 

This will ensure that you can travel together as a group with the other students and make the most of your collective experience. 

Once again, congratulations on reaching this significant milestone, and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing you soon! ✈️🌍
31/08/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 549 1711: Thank you ma'am

31/08/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 2:54 am - +263 77 495 6142: Thank you for sharing the same. Please I may need clarity on the following,is the $296 paid per student?
01/09/23, 2:56 am - +263 77 495 6142: We only got this some hours before the 1 September deadline which is today.....which means we can meet the 102 deadline
01/09/23, 4:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: I completely understand your concern, @263774956142. It's true that the $296 is a one-time fee that all students are required to pay for furnishing. However, you do have the option to recoup this cost by reselling the furniture once you move out of the apartment. As you've just begun the process of arranging your accommodation, I recommend reaching out to Ms. Eugene to determine the deadline for booking your stay. She'll be able to provide you with additional assistance and guidance.

10/09/23, 10:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 10:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Tatenda Matilda Chisunga
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, 

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 10:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you want to bring your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
11/09/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 495 6142: <Media omitted>

Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.

11/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 495 6142: Have noted all the above but I have some queries regarding the way you disseminate your information.Tatenda is left with only a few hours to board the plane and it's only now that you are notifying us of covid pcr test certificate and $50 busfare.Sending my daughter to India does not mean I always have money at hand.We need time to budget all this and it can't just come now
11/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 495 6142: Are you aware that despite having bought the tickets all these that are coming in now might make her fail to travel tomorrow because we will not be able to meet these sudden expenses at such a short notice
11/09/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern @263774956142, but as you have shared your ticket today that's why you have received the guideline a bit late. Although, let me inform you if you have vaccination certificate then you don't have to do covid test. you can carry your certificate.

This is to bring in your kind attention Tatenda is not responding in the group and is not picking calls too, this is an urgent reminder to ask him to get connected so we can help him in his academic journey at our best.
21/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 495 6142: Good evening Mr Mukund,I think there is a mix up somewhere here, Tatenda is a girl and not a he,I am rightly informed she even came to your office Sunday morning
21/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 495 6142: On another note
21/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 495 6142: I want to ask something,when we went for the meet and greet session here in Harare,they spoke about the student grant
21/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 495 6142: May I know how can my daughter Tatenda have access to the grant also.....and who is eligible for it
21/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 495 6142: What is needed for her to be offered the grace for the grant also
22/11/23, 5:56 am - +91 93546 23922: Dear parents,

While it appears there may have been a typographical error, the underlying issue remains valid—his lack of activity and responsiveness in the group persists. Additionally, considering Sunday is not a working day for all of us, his presence in the office on that day would not be beneficial. Instead, it would be more constructive for him to be present on days when I visit the campus.

Regarding the grant, the primary condition has consistently been active participation in the group and timely responses. For further details, including the amount and specifics of the grant, it is recommended to direct inquiries to the mentors. They are the appropriate individuals to provide accurate information.
