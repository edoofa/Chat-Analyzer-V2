29/08/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Twanani,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
29/08/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please
29/08/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with me. That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/08/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes I'm ready
29/08/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 686 1310: I'm done
29/08/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply, dear. I was occupied with a meeting.
29/08/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are done with the steps. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/08/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 686 1310: We can proceed
29/08/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/08/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please
29/08/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/08/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
29/08/23, 4:23 pm - +27 65 946 2390: I'm following the steps also, but step number 5 I'm not getting it mybe it's me who not understanding about the issue of registration I don't know 🤷🏼‍♀️

What I heard is we must pay $350 to reserve a seat after that he will proceed with Earn While You Learn, however the registration amount wiil be adjusted in the first year when he arrives to India,,

That's how I heard 🤷🏼‍♀️please correct me if i misunderstood
29/08/23, 5:26 pm - +27 65 946 2390: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you get this clear, dear. The $350 was for the enrollment into the edoofa program where as the University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
29/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky understood now
29/08/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
29/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 686 1310: No we can proceed if i get queries I'll ask as we discuss
29/08/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/08/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes we can
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, @263786861310 . In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

I am sharing you with the videos now, dear.
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. I would also like to update you that I will not be available to take your session tomorrow as it will be non-working for me tomorrow. So, I suggest we shall connect on Thursday at 7:30 PM. In the meantime, I would like you to watch the videos and kindly prepare your understanding. Have a great day.
31/08/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Twanani,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
31/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 686 1310: How are you. Yes I'm ready
31/08/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to watch the videos @263786861310 ?
31/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes i managed to watch them all
31/08/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, dear. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
31/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Video 1 was all about to follow instructions on all the stages of Edoofa. Video 2  briefly describes what the student must do after getting the opportunity of beibg an Edoofian. Video 3  founders talk on how they choose universities or colleges for their students and also their journey of 10 years until  they sucked to their dreams. Video 4 which is the last video founders prepare the SOP that is send to various universities explaining why a student prefer to study abroad  under scholarship
31/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
31/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
31/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
31/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
31/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please let's move
31/08/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
31/08/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 PM.
31/08/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

31/08/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Thank you very much
01/09/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Twanani, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
01/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Soil fertility is the ability of soil to sustain plant gowth by providing essential  plant nutrients and favourable chemical , physical and biological  characteristics as a habitat for plant growth.

The measurement  of the fertility of soil usually done by  chemicals analysis for plant nutrients  such as nitrogen ,potassium, phosphorus and trace elements , as well as physical measurement of soil structure

It can be improved by planting  cover crops and adding organic matter
01/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
01/09/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
01/09/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Very clear and correct
01/09/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
01/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
01/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
01/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
01/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
01/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
01/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
01/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
01/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know you are clear here as well?
01/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please
01/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
01/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
01/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/09/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/09/23, 11:03 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes i do have questions with respect to those you mentioned above
02/09/23, 10:08 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Twanani. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

04/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 686 1310: We can proceed now
04/09/23, 10:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that Name! Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know if your parents are connected with us here in order to move ahead with the discussion?

05/09/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that Twanani ! Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know if your parents are connected with us here in order to move ahead with the discussion? <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 7:50 pm - +27 65 946 2390: Good evening sir? Yes I'm connected
05/09/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky they're now here
05/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Blessing. May I know if you have any concerns or queries that you would like to share about Twanani's admission process so far?
05/09/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 686 1310: For now we have no queries maybe we'll ask as we continue
05/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process (enrol yourself at the university) and that is only done after their parents/guardians give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their ward's next steps.
05/09/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
05/09/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is actually a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
05/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please
05/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
05/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
05/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
05/09/23, 8:24 pm - +27 65 946 2390: My apologies, here I'm the network is poor, but we're on the same page
05/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware that your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you would be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750.
05/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 7th September 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 22nd September 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?
	
*Note: The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further*
05/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Very clear and well explained
05/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, since all the students have received their results and are eager to complete their university admission process, If you as parents are prepared to proceed with your wards’ admission process, we will share your application with the universities this week so that you can get the scholarship offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, the registration fee due will be $750 and you will have to pay it as per the deadline of 22nd September 2023.
05/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky noted
05/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now Blessing, if you as Sister are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadline, shall we go ahead with Twanani's university application process and share his application with the universities recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?

Alternatively, if you need time to discuss the same and then move ahead, you can do that as well, please.
05/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 686 1310: I think it will be fair if you allow us to discuss for a short time before decide
05/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please take your time with the discussion about the admission process and we shall connect once you have made your decision for the go head of the scholarship application.
05/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky thank you
05/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 65 946 2390: Yes we need time to discuss
06/09/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Twanani. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family and were able to come to a conclusion regarding your admission process? 

Given the fact that your year of intake is 2023, most of the students have already finalized their registration process.
07/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Hello how are you
07/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through my above message, dear?

07/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. So, Blessing may I know if you were able to come to a conclusion?
07/09/23, 6:57 pm - +27 65 946 2390: Yes please,, we discussed and it was me, Twanani and our parents on that discussion we come up with one mind since I'm the breadwinner of the family my parents are not working,, alright that not the main issue 🤦🏼‍♀️

The issue is our money is not enough to cover all the things that is wanted to cover like now, the likes of registration fee, so my parents was suggesting if it is possible for Twanani to join the next year intake? On other hand I will be able to raise the money for the next intake

I don't know if it is possible 🤷🏼‍♀️
07/09/23, 10:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
08/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 686 1310: Thank you very much. How are you this morning hope you're fine
08/09/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

08/09/23, 5:45 pm - +27 65 946 2390: Oky sir,, the main challenge is that we can't manage to get  $750 that will be needed in 15 days strictly and also we dont know how much is the visa application and the flight ticket as well

16/09/23, 9:35 am - +27 65 946 2390: Good morning to you too,, here we are doing well
16/09/23, 9:35 am - +27 65 946 2390: Yes we did go through it
16/09/23, 9:35 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 686 1310: 1.$900
2.4 years(8 semesters)
3.$300
4.$750
16/09/23, 9:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
16/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/09/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 686 1310: Oky so on the costs of accommodation when staying on campus, will EWYL credits include these costs
16/09/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note Twanani, the amount of EWYL Credits that you will earn over time will be accumulated and at end of each semester, you would be able to use those credits to bring down the cost of tuition fee and if there would still be credits available for you to use, then they can also be used to lower down the accommodation costs please. I hope this is clear?
16/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 686 1310: Yes this is clear
16/09/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
16/09/23, 11:14 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 686 1310: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please but i have a question
16/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
16/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
16/09/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.

This means that you are required to complete the payment of the registration fee by 29th September 2023 in order to finalize your admission so that we can move ahead to the next steps in your admission process, is that clear?
16/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Ok
16/09/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/09/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 686 1310: No I'm in Chiredzi
16/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. However, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 686 1310: What about to send him that $750 on his account while I'm here in Chiredzi and then he'll make the arrangements to transfer it to the university account
16/09/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please if you wish to make a bank transfer, in that case, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/09/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes send them
18/09/23, 8:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Twanani!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/09/23, 8:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
18/09/23, 8:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/09/23, 8:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Twanani!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/09/23, 8:39 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier when we were connected with each other here to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other to proceed with the conversation and complete the next steps in your admission journey?
19/09/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 686 1310: Morning how are you sir
19/09/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine dear, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through the bank details of Mr. Charles that I had shared earlier?
19/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 686 1310: Yes sir i managed to go through them now we're processing to make both payments , that balance of enrollment fee and the registration fee
19/09/23, 11:49 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, on that note, can you please also let me know by when are you planning to make the payment as well please?
19/09/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 686 1310: We were planning to do it on Friday
19/09/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, let us move ahead to complete our discussion here as well, shall we?
19/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
19/09/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
19/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky so this is supposed to be paid by the end of year or else
19/09/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Twanani, when it comes to the per annum fee, then it has to be paid in two equal parts, first part to be paid when you will arrive here in India and the second part to be paid in the second semester. I hope this is clear now?
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky let's say i managed to arrive in India this year, am i supposed to pay it this year or next year
19/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case Twanani, half of that would be required at your arrival and the other half in the second semester please.
19/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 686 1310: So are you saying my semester is going to start this year
19/09/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, as soon as your admission would be completed you will then arrive here in India by the coming month.
19/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 686 1310: It is where I'm supposed to pay $1400
19/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 686 1310: ??
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. Let me explain the same to you here. Now, that you are aware that your per annum expenses are $2000. And out of that the registration fee that you will pay will be adjusted in your first year fee as well. 

This means that once it is paid, the balance fee would be $2000 - $750 = $1250. Out of this, only $250 would be required to be cleared in the first semester and the rest of it would be paid in the second semester please.
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Now you explained to me clearly thank you very much i got you
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes please
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes
19/09/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 686 1310: For now I'm satisfied .Please share
19/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle. 

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 686 1310: Good morning @Milan Singh
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Twanani!
20/09/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family about the offer letter from Galgotias Univesity by now?
20/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 686 1310: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes we did, besides Galgotias there's no another university where i can go
20/09/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here?
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 686 1310: It's clear sir
20/09/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Sure, so i was suggesting to wait for other universities to evaluate my application and give me back an offer later and then  i choose one of my choice
20/09/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand what you are trying to say Twanani. Now, as you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Thanks a lot for that advise. I never knew that students can be allowed to transfer
20/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 686 1310: So in that case we can proceed with Galgotias
20/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yeah I'm getting you
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be clear with the transfer option, right?
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Sure
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 686 1310: May you help me please. I was suggesting to make my payments on Friday both registration fee and that balance of enrollment fee, unfortunately the money isn't enough for both payments, is it possible to pay $500 for both and finish off the balance next week
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please also let me know that if you are done with the payment of $500 on Friday then by when would you be able to clear the balance as well?
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Thank you I'll let you know
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Twanani, can you please let me know of that now so that I can help you in planning the way ahead as well?
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky if i make the payments on Friday, i think next week on Thursday I'll be abke to clear the balance
20/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, you can move ahead to make the payment of the first part of $500 on Friday and the rest on Thursday please. I will discuss the same with the academic board as well.
20/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky
20/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries to ask Twanani?
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 686 1310: No
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please we can now conclude our discussion for the day. And on Friday, when you would be done with the payment, please share the receipt of the same with me here so that I can get it confirmed from the side of the university.
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Oky
22/09/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Twanani!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had earlier, you were planning to make the payment of a part of your registration fee today, hence, can you share an update with me on that if the payment is done or not?
22/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Afternoon how are you
22/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 686 1310: We're in the bank to make that payment, we gonna delay because of the que but i promise to do it today
22/09/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are done with that, please let me know.
22/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 686 1310: I'll make sure that i send you the bank statements of payment
24/09/23, 6:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Twanani!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 6:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Earlier, when we had connected with each other here, you mentioned that you were going to make the payment of the registration fee on Friday, hence, can you please share an update with me on that whether you were able to do that or not please?
24/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Good evening how are you
24/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 686 1310: We've managed to make the payments  of $500 yesterday
24/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 686 1310: I also sent the receipts
24/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Please let me know if you received them
24/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 686 1310: <Media omitted>
24/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 686 1310: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Twanani!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation.

I am sending the offer letter here, please go through it once and then we will connect with each other here at 01.30 PM CAT so that we can discuss the same.
28/09/23, 9:44 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/09/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
28/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Afternoon how are you doing sir
28/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yes we did
28/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
28/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 686 1310: 1. 1225 USD
2.4 years 
3. 200 USD 
4. 700 USD
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4325.
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3650.
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
28/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 686 1310: Yeah I'm getting you very much
28/09/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

So I don't know if it is possible for Twanani to partake next year intake I don't know I'm just suggesting if it's possible or not 🤷🏼‍♀️
06/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am doing well @27659462390. Thank you for letting us know regarding your ongoing situation, Please don't be stressed as we understand sometimes we faces the unpredictable challenges. May I know what happened to her, as last we connected she was recovering.

06/11/23, 6:44 pm - +27 65 946 2390: Wanted to ask if it's possible for Twanani to partake the next year intake since this year seems like lucky is not on our side

09/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Twanani, I hope you are doing well. 

Based on our last conversation, I reached out to academic board to discuss the concern you had regarding your admission intake and I highlighted your concern regarding the financial constraints. The academic board mentioned that since the intake you wanted to join was August 2023 and it's already been four months. If Twanani plans to come India right now he would miss out a lot of classes by default. Hence, the academic board mentioned that if the student want to change the academic intake we can successfully help you in that matter, I'll help you with the procedure which you have to undertake in order to change your admission intake. <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, considering that you have a pending formality of $100 for your remaining registration fees it is quite proofing for you to make the payment before November 15th. If you miss the same due date in that case your academic intake would be defer to 2024 but you would end up missing out on the financial benefits which means your fees structure will also be revised. If you wish that your fees structure must be same according to 2023 admission intake then you have to make the payment before November 15th.
14/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Twanani,
