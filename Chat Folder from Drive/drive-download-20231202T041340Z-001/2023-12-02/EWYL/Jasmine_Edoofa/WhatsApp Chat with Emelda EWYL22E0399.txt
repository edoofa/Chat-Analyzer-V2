I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

24/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh);  that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually.

24/11/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent Emelda, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter?

Can you recall what they were?
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 92893 20693: It was about attending all the webinars and also about the EWYL program and attending all the lectures
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 92893 20693: Yes
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.

25/11/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 2:14 pm - +91 92893 20693: The spirit of competition is the sense of drive, determination, and ambition that people feel when they're competing against others. It's a mindset that pushes people to do their best and perform at a high level. In business, the spirit of competition can motivate people to work harder, be more innovative.
25/11/23, 2:18 pm - +91 92893 20693: Spirit of competition didn't play a pivotal role in achieving success in my life rather it reduces stress level and it gives you pressure
