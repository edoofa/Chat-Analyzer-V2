My name is Jasmine, and you can refer to me as *Ms. Jasmine*. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. 22-09-2023 from *8:30 am to 9:30 am,* during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
22/09/23, 8:06 am - +263 71 510 5385: Morning Mis Jasmine
For me it won't be an issue 

Maybe Talent,  since he is at School.  He may need to confirm whether he won't be having a lesson
22/09/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/09/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
22/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Good afternoon
22/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 871 0127: I have lessons during the day but l can manage from around 7 pm till late
25/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Talent and Parents*
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. 
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
25/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 871 0127: this one can work out perfectly fine
25/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Talent
25/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you please tell me the option that you are comfortable with?
25/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 510 5385: Good morning
25/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 510 5385: Talent must be in class
25/09/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Can you please check the options
25/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 871 0127: morning
25/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 871 0127: 2 is fine
08/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 871 0127: Good morning l had confirmed that option 2 was okay
10/10/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon,*_ 
How are you doing? It's time for the session. 
Are you ready?
10/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Fine and you ?

10/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 871 0127: kindly make me admin so l can add my father's new number
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊

10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Talent, May I know that can we have our session right now?
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yes we can
10/10/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Talent, before we begin, I'd like to inquire if you can commit to attending our sessions every day, starting at 8:30 am and ending at 9:30 am?
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 871 0127: I am starting my A level final exams next  so l think l can commit for this week for the sessions for 8.30am to 9.30am
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Next week might be impossible to commit to the timetable so l would suggest the weekend where l will be exam free
10/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Alright, here's my suggestion: for this week, please plan to attend the sessions from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. Then, next week, remind me, and I will make the necessary adjustments to your session timings. Does this arrangement work for you?
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yeah its perfect
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Thank you very much
10/10/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 871 0127: yes
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share it with me
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 871 0127: focused on increasing a students capacity for success and also employable
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
10/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Surely reduces the burden from my parents back
10/10/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
10/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
10/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 871 0127: forgive me for late replies my internet connection is very slow
10/10/23, 3:39 pm - +265 983 20 93 06 joined using this group's invite link
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No need to apologize, I understand. Slow internet connections can be frustrating. Just do your best, and we'll work through it together.
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/10/23, 3:39 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Thank you
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - +265 983 20 93 06: Noted thank you
11/10/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good morning, Talent!_*
 "Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow." - Robert Kiyosaki

*It's time for our session!* Let's dive in, embrace the day, and work together towards your bright future. 🚀
11/10/23, 8:39 am - +265 983 20 93 06: Good morning
11/10/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you Talent?
11/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 871 0127: Fine how are you ?
11/10/23, 9:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊 May I know that are you available for the session?
11/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 871 0127: yes
11/10/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is a great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
11/10/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 871 0127: Done
11/10/23, 10:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Talent’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
11/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
11/10/23, 10:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
11/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
11/10/23, 10:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 10:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
11/10/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 871 0127: clear
11/10/23, 10:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Talent can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
11/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 871 0127: yes
11/10/23, 10:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if is Talent available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
11/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 871 0127: l cant promise to be available during the exam period but soon after exams l can promise
11/10/23, 10:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know when are your exams Talent?
11/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 871 0127: from 18 October to 23 November
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So do you want to put the sessions on hold and resume them after the exams Talent?
11/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
