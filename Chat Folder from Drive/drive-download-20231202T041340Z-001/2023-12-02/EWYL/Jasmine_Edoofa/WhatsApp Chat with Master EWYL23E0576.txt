15/09/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great
15/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 723 2303: My career counsellor Ms Tushti.She thought me more about the Earn While You Learn Program which gave me the courage to work. This program I have seen it as a wave destroying financial problems not for me only but for many students. Looking at the pictures of certificates of students who had succeed in getting these programmes the likes of Mandebvu Vimbikai Praise, Tapiwa Lynnette Mandongwe, Nkosilathi Kelvin Kaseke and many other students who are highly paid by this program which Ms Tushti shared with me, I can say I was greatly inspired . I see this being helpful to my parents and I, since my parents will be able to look after my siblings and stress is reduced. This program reduces many expenses for example  basic University expenses which my parents and other parents of some students can not meet at a given time. This Edoofa program does not limit students with enthusiasm to do more and this is giving us as students the exposure to big brands and companies, with this I  think Edoofa  Earn While You Learn Program is the way to make it in life. I thank Ms Tushti for for letting me see what I was not seeing. My long term goals are to be on top and be able to change my background
15/09/23, 9:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, I would like to tell you that Nkosilathi Kelvin Kaseke is under my mentorship. Your aspirations to reach the top and transform your background are incredibly ambitious and inspiring. All the Best Master

15/09/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Definitely. So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
15/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I have had about it let me share it with you
15/09/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great
15/09/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
15/09/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 723 2303: EWYL Program it is a program designed for students to gain scholarship credits and have exposure to working in different aspects. These credits help students to an extent that they will end up paying there own fees. This will help to reduce pressure on parents to look for university fee
15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct! The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education.

20/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 723 2303: Creating whatsapp group: Titled Edoofa Scholarship program 
Description : Those who want to study abroad with affordable price can join my group/ opportunity to study abroad 
Adding Ms Jasmine as my Mentor who will be tracing my interactive with the students. 
Objectives
Identifying students who are on the right position to study abroad.
A minimum of 60 students
20/09/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 723 2303: At my school the program was already introduced but I have introduced this program to my former school where I did my O level to give many students there the opportunity to study abroad under the Edoofa Scholarship program
20/09/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Master, I am impressed with your understanding. 

While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -

26/09/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, you can share the forms here in the group
26/09/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

I would be pleased if you also help your students at your school who also want to achieve their goals through the Edoofa Scholarship program by taking part into this scholarship program. 
Thank you. 
Ans2. Harare
26/09/23, 10:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa.

26/09/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I agree
26/09/23, 10:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok Ms Jasmine
26/09/23, 10:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
26/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am ready
26/09/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

26/09/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities.

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

03/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 78 723 2303: Its 2025 of which I realised it now
03/10/23, 8:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you Master?
03/10/23, 8:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Master are you aware that 2025 admissions are not open yet?
03/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am aware
03/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 723 2303: I am fine and you
03/10/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
03/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok
03/10/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
03/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 723 2303: So how am I going to do this since most of our local schools are less than $100 per term
03/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 723 2303: I have managed to get application laters from boarding schools and most of them I sent them to you
03/10/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So you can do one thing. You can start your project by working with these schools. As you must be aware school fees increased rapidly due to inflation. So once the school fees go beyond 100$, we will reach out to them and then start the process. 
How does that sound?
03/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 723 2303: Sounds ok
03/10/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, When you went to the borading school, did you managed to get in touch with the headmaster?
03/10/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 723 2303: They were not available but we talked on WhatsApp and said will get in touch with me when they are free
03/10/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, That is great. Now let me tell you the reason behind this
03/10/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

10/10/23, 12:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Master,
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly check if you've had the opportunity to send the email regarding putting your sessions on hold, as I haven't had the chance to receive it yet.
11/10/23, 12:08 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok Ms Jasmine
11/10/23, 12:08 am - +263 78 723 2303: . But I sent the email though
16/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon*_ @263787232303 @263777766244 
I trust you all are doing well. I know your child is currently focused on school and exams, and you've formally paused the sessions. However, I want to ensure that Master stays connected with the community's progress, and that's why _*I'm willing to share the newsletter from the past week.*_ 📰

*I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to review this newsletter and provide me with your thoughts and feedback*🚀
16/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 723 2303: 1. I do align with Henry Ford's belief because life is what you make it.
2. If I successfully apply this principal I see my self being an achiever in life. In life you should be your own boss to say that you have achieved. I can give an example related to this. My father when he was twenty three years old he was employed to work in an industry that deals with manufacturing of hydraulic seals. He start to learn how to manufacture these sells. This company was the only company that manufactured hydraulic seals in Zimbabwe. Later on he decided to quit and start his own business that deals with manufacturing of hydraulic seals and by the grace of God he made it. He is now having his own company that deals with manufacturing of hydraulic seals. This gives me zeal to do more in life and to make any risks in order to become someone. It's not about being the
very best at what you do but being able to
take risks. In a world with a limitation of finances , money can
be limited but your dreams
cannot
be
limited. Dream big and
you achieve big
16/10/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's evident that you have a strong belief in taking control of your life and pursuing your dreams. Your story about your father's journey is inspiring and a testament to the importance of taking risks and dreaming big. Keep that determination alive, and you'll undoubtedly achieve great things in your life. Your commitment is admirable, and I appreciate your contribution to our discussion. Keep it up
16/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Thank you Ms Jasmine
