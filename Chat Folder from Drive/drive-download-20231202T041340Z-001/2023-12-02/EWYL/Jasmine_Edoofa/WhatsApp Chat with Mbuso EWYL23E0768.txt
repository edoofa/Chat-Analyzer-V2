09/10/23, 11:42 pm - +263 77 294 7757: *Dear Mentor, my name is Mbuso Ndlovu and my EWYL group name is Mbuso EWYL23E0768.*
10/10/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon,*_ 
How are you doing? It's time for the session. 
Are you ready?
10/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good afternoon
10/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes we can start
10/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
10/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Thank you for the warm welcome
10/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 294 7757: My guess 
Providing creadible affordable scholarships to deserving students
And also securing credibld universities for students
10/10/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Mbuso is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Waal this is great, thnk you for enlightening me
10/10/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
10/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok this is marvellous too
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings Ms Sanjana, its a pleasure to chat with you. We are looking forward to your guidance
10/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, you did
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
12/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Well noted, thank you
12/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them,
12/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Done
12/10/23, 2:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Mbuso’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Noted, thank you
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
12/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Its ok thank you very very much
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
