21/09/23, 10:58 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Lushomo will not be available for any of these. She is in boarding school far away from home. She has no access to any phone because the school doesn't allow. So I will just represent  her in this program for now until when she completes her exams end of November.

04/10/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know the reason of the delay in attending the session?
04/10/23, 11:11 am - Look Good and Feel Good: The problem is sometimes the time confuses me. Currently am not in Zambia, am in India. So I miscalculated the time.
04/10/23, 11:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am sorry, I just failed to understand it. May I know how come you are in India since you are expected to come next year?
04/10/23, 11:17 am - Look Good and Feel Good: My dear I told you that Lushomo is at school in boarding in Zambia. I am the mother to Lushomo  I  am just representing her in these programs. I am in India because I escorted my sister for medical attention.
04/10/23, 11:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I remember you told me that Lushomo is in boarding school but never mentioned about your availability in India.
04/10/23, 11:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, now as per Indian time, tomorrow we will have the session from 04:00-05:00 PM IST.

Let's begin with our session📍
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @260977117478
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Yes please
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Lushomo will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 7:07 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Good evening,  I have read the document.  Wao!! I like these projects. This is a great initiative.
09/10/23, 8:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
09/10/23, 8:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you have liked it, we will soon discuss this in our session.
09/10/23, 8:18 am - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏
09/10/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our sessions?
09/10/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @260977117478
09/10/23, 1:12 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Sure
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lushomo can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 1:21 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Yes.
09/10/23, 1:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
09/10/23, 1:24 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
09/10/23, 1:47 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay, understood.  So what am I supposed to do at this point?
09/10/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to do this.
17/10/23, 8:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 8:22 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay thanks, will do so.
17/10/23, 8:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for the same.
17/10/23, 9:39 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Good morning, I have read the newsletter. I really love the quotes given in there especially the first one which says don't worry about being successful but put in work first and success will follow. This is very true, you need to add value first, you need to give out first before you expect a return. I have learnt about this principle and also about the importance of having a clear goal from the book I am reading which is entitled "Think and grow rich."

Thanks to Edoofa, the students under your care are learning the real stuff which will really empower them in life.
17/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!
17/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 10:04 am - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏
26/10/23, 5:50 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: These similarities just show that human beings are all one. It doesn't matter where one comes from. The underlying factor is that we are one people and all created in the image of God.
27/10/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 12:52 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏
