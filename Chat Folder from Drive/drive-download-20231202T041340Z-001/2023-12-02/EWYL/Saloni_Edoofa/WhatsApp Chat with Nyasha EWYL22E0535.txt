It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
18/10/23, 1:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
