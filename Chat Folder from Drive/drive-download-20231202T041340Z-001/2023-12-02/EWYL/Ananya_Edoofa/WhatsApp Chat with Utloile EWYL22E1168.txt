12/08/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Yes!
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Are we doing it here or on the line
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here, the grant discussion!
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright!
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Yes please
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 622 0393: This has surely on another level inspired me more
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Through trying as much as possible to follow up with the EWYL time table and appreciating the work I'm assigned to do along with the assistance
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Thank you so much ma'am, so much empowering.
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 622 0393: So there are more quests coming?
16/08/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, soon!
16/08/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Great!
18/08/23, 7:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning!

Please accept my apologies for not being able to connect. I wasn't feeling well and had to take a day to rest.
18/08/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 622 0393: That's great!
18/08/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Wishing you more good health
18/08/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 278 4372: Wish you a quick recovery
19/08/23, 1:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can share the letters with deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com
19/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright

19/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 622 0393: It's indeed wonderful!

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. Let's make this session unforgettable!
18/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Noted!
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Besides this you have gotten my other inquiries right?
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have marked you present, Utloile!
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, you can share your field of interest and I can convey this to your Career Development Officer.
18/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Okay ma'am, thank you 😊
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright. I am in the science field, school of physical science and chemical engineering. I'm studying BSc hons in chemistry. Hopefully I will major into medicinal and pharmacological chemistry
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Ohhh my apologies, regarding the AI I am actually using it already.
18/10/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Utloile! I have shared your interests with our Career Development Officer.
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 622 0393: How do I get contacts because I have tried sharing my story on my end it's not really giving output
18/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, one of my students' friends is studying in a different school. She has actually joined their WhatsApp class groups and is now communicating with them. Not only that, since she is connected with students from various schools, she is also obtaining the contact information of school administrators. This way, she is working on two separate projects simultaneously.
Don't you think it is an amazing idea?
18/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Again you promised to share with us the materials to use for enhancing our approach
18/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 622 0393: It is very amazing
18/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Utloile, I wanted to share about the video. You can follow these instructions to create  a video!
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let's conclude today's session. We will connect according to our timetable.

Good night!✨
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 622 0393: I mean documents and information of how far people have benefited from Edoofa lately
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright ma'am. Thank you for today's session

So, do you have any doubts about it? Did you find something new or useful?
06/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Greetings ma'am, isn't it the same we discussed
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as promised in our $300 training session,  I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:

- Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!

15/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 622 0393: This is very interesting!
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 622 0393: On social media, though I'm not sure how we can reach out effectively to people
15/11/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Do you remember this?

23/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 622 0393: You mean the guidelines to attaining the grant fully or the guidelines for withdrawal
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
23/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Alright so I know about 1, 2 and 3. How do I know my attendance for 4th point
23/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Specially in my case, my school timetable does not give me a break unless I ditch classes to come home early for the seminars and everything
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We will discuss this throughout Utloile, don't worry!
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Okay ma'am.
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 


The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 4:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Utloile, I was waiting for you to discuss your grant eligibility with me. However, I understand how important this is. I am rescheduling your session for tomorrow at 6:00 PM.

25/11/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Utloile!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *7:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: I hope that you will now be available.
Cannot wait to see you!🤝🏽
25/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 622 0393: Okay ma'am, thank you so much for the sacrifice
25/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 622 0393: I've set a reminder
25/11/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Utloile!🌸

I hope you are doing well. Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
25/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Good evening ma'am
25/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 622 0393: I'm ready

25/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's a different call, Utloile! That's scheduled for 7:00 PM.
25/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 622 0393: okay maam
25/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 622 0393: but I am ready right now
25/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
25/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
25/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 622 0393: so there is the discussion and the video call separately
25/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes
25/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 622 0393: okay
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes maam I do understand and I have so much value towards bringing back to the community
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 622 0393: i hope my timetable becomes less tiring with time
25/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes im aware
25/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Yes
25/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 622 0393: 3 webinars out of 6?
25/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the call!
25/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 622 0393: I have joined
25/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Congratulations_*

Now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
25/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Thank you ma'am, your diligence in grooming us is very much appreciated
25/11/23, 5:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
25/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 622 0393: So ma'am I have a question
25/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 622 0393: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 11:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*

Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program over the call, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project.

Only after receiving your understanding of the training will you be able to receive the certificate of a certified student leader.
27/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 622 0393: Alright!
27/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 622 0393: Greetings ma'am
27/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 622 0393: So basically the $300 dollar plan is a modification of what we were already doing. So a lot of students who have been referred to by us or fellow edoofians have been saying they really do not know about the actual Edoofa as a scholarship program and not sponsorship. So we are to go through a set of questions with the applicants before sharing their forms then afterwards when we see that they've answered well the questions and are eligible for the next phase we may share the filled application. We are to maximize our reach through out all social media platforms that we can get to. We should also keep in mind that proof incase one of the applicants may say some information was not shared.
27/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 622 0393: Ma'am I wanted to ask if I can redeem the previous grant of $200 per year this semester?
27/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 622 0393: Things are a bit rough back home
27/11/23, 11:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Utloile, Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 11:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes maam ill put in more effort into it
27/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes maam i think ill also request more push messages as well as calls if need be if that's okay with you.
27/11/23, 12:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 622 0393: They just messaged me yes
27/11/23, 12:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 12:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes im willing , ive actually been broadcasting messages through social media so far
27/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes ma'am duly noted
27/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want to share fact with you that many of you are not realising, while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
27/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes ma'am
27/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 622 0393: honestly i do try as hard but i have one of the busiest courses on campus and een as we speak right now im wring assignments and field based on the other hand i also have Cas practical exams and incoming exams everything is just packed up
27/11/23, 12:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Utloile. However, if you can invest 30 minutes/day in community building, it will be easy for you to get at least 1-2 students in a month. Trust me, that's enough for a start.
27/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 622 0393: yes, im definitely implementing that this month
27/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's do one thing: go and try searching for some school groups. I'm sure you have friends from another school back in your home country; try to join their official group.

This is your home work for today, come back tomorrow and give me an update.
27/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 622 0393: okay maam
27/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 622 0393: thank you so much
27/11/23, 12:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, since the admissions for 2025 have started, you can also reach out to your junior group from the school.
27/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 622 0393: unfortunately we do not have those groups and a lot  of contacts were lost due to the shift
27/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, however you can connect with your juniors through various social media platforms and ask them to share the group link.
27/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 622 0393: alright ill try that
