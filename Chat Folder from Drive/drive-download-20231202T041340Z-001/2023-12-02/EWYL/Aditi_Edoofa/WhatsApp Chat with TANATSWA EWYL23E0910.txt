29/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 791 3093: There's my father who is also my sponsor and who is eager for me to go India and my mother who also wish that l go to India and they both wish that l find something to do like a job so that l can relieve them in terms of finances
29/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to have the support and enthusiasm of your parents, especially when it comes to pursuing opportunities in India. Their wish for you to find a job and contribute in terms of finances reflects their belief in your potential and your ability to make a positive impact. It's truly heartening to have such a strong support system.
29/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 791 3093: Yes that's true
29/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 791 3093: And l really appreciate their support
29/11/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
29/11/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Tanatswa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 791 3093: My long term goals is manage my own enterprise so EWYL will help me with plenty of business ideas anf and how are they managed
29/11/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic long-term goal! The combination of practical experience, networking opportunities, and industry insights offered by the EWYL Program can certainly contribute significantly to your goal of managing your own enterprise.
29/11/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 791 3093: Yes mam
29/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 791 3093: No mam can you please highlight them for me
29/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 791 3093: Understood
29/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 791 3093: Ok understood
29/11/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 791 3093: Hello Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
29/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 791 3093: Understood mam
29/11/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 791 3093: Yah sounds interesting
29/11/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
29/11/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
30/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
30/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 791 3093: This sounds great
30/11/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
