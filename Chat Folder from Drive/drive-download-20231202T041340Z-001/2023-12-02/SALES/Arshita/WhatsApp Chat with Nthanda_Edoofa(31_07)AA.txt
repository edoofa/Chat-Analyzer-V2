18/08/23, 1:22 pm - Austin#276: Dear parents, since this would be last week to consider the application of Nthanda, may I know, are you willing to enroll Nthanda in the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
18/08/23, 3:07 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: Yes very much willing     ..

When exactly is the due date Austin
18/08/23, 3:16 pm - Austin#276: Noted Mr Nkhono!
The actual due date for Nthanda's application was on 14th August but since the results were around the corner we decided to wait for them. It is advised to initiate the enrollment fee transaction process tomorrow itself to reserve her scholarship seat.
18/08/23, 3:37 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: OK ok....

But with our forex issues in Malawi, would it be possible to start the process mid next week. Will dknit without fail Mr Austin
18/08/23, 7:40 pm - Austin#276: I do understand the forex challenges, Mr Nkhono!
Let me suggest the easiest method through which parents have paid this week and last week

You must visit your bank branch and complete the international transfer form after which the deposit has to be made. The bank will take 1-4 days to complete the transaction from their end. You need to send the picture of the sealed form after which we begin the Admissions process and once the transfer is confirmed, the SWIFT receipt has to be shared
18/08/23, 7:45 pm - +265 990 24 38 77: Thank you so much
18/08/23, 7:49 pm - Austin#276: You are most welcome, Nthanda!
18/08/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: Well understood. It will be so Mr. Austin
18/08/23, 8:18 pm - Austin#276: Sure Mr Nkono, let me know if you need any assistance
18/08/23, 8:19 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: For now, we will try to explore this and see what happens this week
18/08/23, 8:29 pm - Austin#276: Sure, Mr Nkono, in case the bank needs an invoice or other details, let me know. You can try to initiate the transaction tomorrow
18/08/23, 8:30 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: Tomorrow I go to church. Will do it on Monday Sir
18/08/23, 8:31 pm - Austin#276: This is well noted, let me convey the same to our Academic Board
18/08/23, 8:36 pm - +265 999 89 21 73: Thank you so much
18/08/23, 8:39 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, have a good night!
