You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 436 2230: Ok
24/11/23, 11:04 am - Sagar: Alright, so Ngonidzashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Denzel, is that correct?
24/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 436 2230: Yes correct
24/11/23, 11:11 am - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Denzel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Denzel's Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 436 2230: Nothing he just asked if l was interested in the scholarship
24/11/23, 11:15 am - Sagar: Noted.
24/11/23, 11:15 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 436 2230: Okay
24/11/23, 11:15 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 11:15 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 11:15 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 11:16 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 436 2230: Yeah that's it
24/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 436 2230: So is accomodation provided
24/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 436 2230: And also l have friends who might be interested in this program how can l introduce them to you
24/11/23, 11:25 am - Sagar: Please be patient Ngonidzashe, every concern that you have will be addressed.
24/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 436 2230: Ok
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: We will send you a form after the counselling session, just make your friends fill it.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: Okay so Ngonidzashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 436 2230: Yes
24/11/23, 11:32 am - Sagar: Alright so Ngonidzashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

24/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 436 2230: Ok
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 436 2230: Yes l am
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the course?
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 436 2230: Yes go on
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sagar: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sagar: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sagar: After being awarded the B.Com degree, candidates can either look for jobs in various departments or opt for higher education.

24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 436 2230: Yes
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

I believe that a Bachelor of Commerce degree  will provide me with the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue a successful career in the field. I also believe that the program will provide me with the opportunity to develop my leadership skills and ability to work in a team. Furthermore, I believe that the program will enable me to gain the confidence and self-belief that I need to achieve my dreams and aspirations
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 436 2230: The Bachelor of Commerce degree will provide me with the opportunity to develop my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. I believe that these skills will be invaluable in helping me to navigate the complexities of the business world. Furthermore, I believe that the program will enable me to gain a deeper understanding of the global economy and the financial markets. This knowledge will allow me to make informed decisions and maximize my potential
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: That is really great Ngonidzashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
24/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 436 2230: I am willing sir
24/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 436 2230: I want to be exposed to new cultures which can enrich my understanding of the world
25/11/23, 9:16 am - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
25/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 436 2230: I will plan to bring back the knowledge and skills l have gained from abroad to help improve the education system in my home country. For example, l could suggest implementing new teaching methods, expanding access to higher education, or promoting intercultural exchange. Additionally, l could focus on how l will use my unique perspective and experience to create change
25/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ngonidzashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
25/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: Don’t you agree?
25/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 436 2230: I agree
25/11/23, 10:08 am - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
25/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 436 2230: Yeah sure
25/11/23, 10:16 am - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
