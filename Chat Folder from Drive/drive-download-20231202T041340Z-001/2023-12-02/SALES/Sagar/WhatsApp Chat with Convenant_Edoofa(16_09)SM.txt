As you know, you are stepping into a very significant phase of your career where you need to identify the right opportunities as we are well aware there are illegitimate organizations and programs that may misguide you. In order to help you differentiate the same, we have started an *Awareness initiative*. Make sure to go through this document thoroughly.
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Yeah I have read it
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Sagar: So very importantly, 
I want to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. *But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Yeah I confident in myself
20/09/23, 2:04 pm - Sagar: Convenant, did you happen to learn about the requirements to study Medicine in india?
20/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 856 0385: I'm working for more than 13 points
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 856 0385: No  I don't have information about
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Convenant, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: However, you can go ahead with the following courses, that are related to the healthcare sector :

*1. Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

*2. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

*3. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

*4. Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

*5. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*6. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*7. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

*8. Bachelor of science in Optometry*
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Do it mean if you have biology chemistry and pure mathematics you cannot study medicine
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sagar: Yes, Covenant.
20/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Oh  I feel disappointed I thought I can study using that combination
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok so which other  course can be on the same level with medicine, I can study using biology chemistry and pure mathematics
20/09/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Shall I brief you on any of these courses in depth?
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Yeah or even out of this
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: B.Sc. Medical Laboratory Technology : What is it about?

A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
20/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok what about in field of engineering
20/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Using my combination
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - Sagar: Convenant, you cannot go for Engineering courses as Physics is a compulsory subject for Engineering
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok I understood
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - Sagar: I understand your disappointment, Covenant. While biology, chemistry, and pure mathematics are excellent subjects, they are not the only ones required for medical school. Medicine typically requires biology and chemistry as core subjects, but it also requires physics
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - Sagar: These all courses have great career prospects and most Zimbabwean students go ahead with these courses
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok so what are the requirements for the course as in number of points
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: *The requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok so  there is no other way I can get into medicine at all ?
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Like starting by doing  other course and advancing into medicine
20/09/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: Covenant, kindly allow me some time, I will get back to you!
20/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Ok I will be waiting for you

21/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 856 0385: Yh i think on number 7
21/09/23, 2:11 pm - Sagar: Physiotherapy : What is it about?
