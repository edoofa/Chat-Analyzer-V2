29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwa. Since the Healthcare Sector encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Medical Dr , specifically Surgeon
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Takudzwa, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it?
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Yeah it's a very crucial medical subject, l didn't pursued biology Because of the problem-solving aspect of physics over the memorization aspect of biology.  I'm really good at mathematics that's why l chose Physics.
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 285 2773: I also heard that MPC is an universal combination it applies to all fields , that's why l didn't do biology , the idea is to shift to maybe chemical engineering when my first dream of becoming Dr fails , yea that's the other reason
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Noted
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
29/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Well l think the origins of my interest were rooted in my desire to help people. I would want to be able to make a positive difference in people's lives and help them when they're in need. Yea l think l have a natural inclination towards helping others ..

30/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwa. Your A-Level subject combination of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics is considered a highly favorable choice for students aspiring to pursue engineering. Could you kindly enlighten me about the motivation that inspired you to opt for this particular combination? Your insights would be genuinely valuable in understanding your academic journey and aspirations
30/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 285 2773: My choice of subjects was motivated by my interest in the natural sciences and mathematics, and my desire to pursue a career in engineering/ medical science. I've always been fascinated by the way the world works, and how math and science can be used to understand and improve it. I also believe that engineering is a field with a lot of potential for innovation and problem-solving, and I want to be a part of that,One of the things that really inspired me to pursue engineering was learning about the work of notable engineers like Nikola Tesla and Elon Musk. Their innovative and forward-thinking approaches to problem-solving really resonated with me, and made me want to pursue a similar path.
