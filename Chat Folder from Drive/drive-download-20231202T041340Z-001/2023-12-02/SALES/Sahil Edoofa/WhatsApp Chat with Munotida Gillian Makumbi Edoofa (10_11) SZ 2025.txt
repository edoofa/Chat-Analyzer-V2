I am a certified  member of the  Rotary sponsored Interact club.. I completed my ordinary  level studies at Regina  Mundi Girls High School and I am currently  learning at Chinhoyi 2 high school . I am studying commercials subjects, these being  Accounting, Economics and Business  Studies. I'm interested in modelling and  making social  media content..I've also taken an interest in  wanting  to raise teenage awareness Because  i feel that most people don't  become as successful as they aim to.. have somehow lost themselves during their teenage phase because  they didn't have any guidance on how to get over that phase. I'm also interested in social  service as well as partaking in church activities.  My hobbies are... playing chess.. throwing  darts and reading novels. My mother holds a masters in counselling  psychology  and she is  currently  employed by the Chinhoyi University  of Technology as the student counselling  coordinator.  My father is a politician.. he is a former mayor of the city of Chinhoyi and currently a ward councillor of the community we live in. He is also self employed runs his own firm under the name "Brawnate Investments ".. I am the third of  four siblings.. I have a 23 year old brother pursing a degree in  Geo Informatics with the Chinhoyi University of Technology. I have 22 year old sister  as well who is pursing her degree  in social work with the university  of Zimbabwe. I have a younger sister in form one at Moleli high school
14/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Gillian. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. You are truly an inspiration, actively contributing to both social and community causes. Your involvement in the Rotary-sponsored Interact club showcases your commitment to service, and your passion for modeling and creating social media content reflects your creativity. It's commendable that you aim to raise awareness among teenagers, recognizing the challenges they face during this crucial phase of life. Your interests in social service and participation in church activities further highlight your well-rounded and compassionate nature. Additionally, engaging in hobbies like playing chess, throwing darts, and reading novels reveals your diverse and enriching personal pursuits. Your dedication to various aspects of life is truly admirable!
14/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Furthermore, Your family's dedication to academics is truly commendable, setting a remarkable example of the importance of education. The commitment to learning and knowledge acquisition within your family undoubtedly creates a nurturing environment for intellectual growth and achievement! Your parents are truly remarkable individuals, each excelling in their respective fields. Mrs. Nolene's achievement of a master's in counseling psychology is impressive, and her role as the Student Counseling Coordinator at Chinhoyi University of Technology showcases her dedication to supporting and guiding students. On the other hand, Mr. Dyke's impactful role in politics, having served as the former mayor of Chinhoyi and currently contributing as a ward councillor, reflects his commitment to community development. Additionally, his entrepreneurial venture, 'Brawnate Investments,' demonstrates his versatility and leadership in both public service and business.

17/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Ok so its hectic  at work I am preparing  for a trip but to answer your question we
 feel that learning  abroad helps  a students  in terms  of exposure to different  ways of doing things  by seeing  how others do. Also   it boosts  confidence  in an individual  by seeing  and  getting  exposed to different  environments. I also feel  the ones chances  of getting employment  in your own country  or in the country  you did your degree
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Are  improved

17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Nolene! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Munotida. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share your results of any term?
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Would it be possible if i waited until I got my results from this term and sent them to you
17/11/23, 4:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
17/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Because we didn't have exams from the previous two terms because  the school  was going through a financial  crisis
17/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Munotida. Can you please share your A-Level subject combination?
17/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Accounting, Economics and Business
17/11/23, 4:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Munotida. Your co-operation is highly appreciated!. Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
17/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Exactly
17/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 880 8732: I  have a list of this i would want to do
1. Digital  marketing
2. Financial engineering 
3. Business administration 
4. Chartered financial analyst
 5.Market analyst
 6.economic consultant
17/11/23, 5:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Financial analysis  focused on analysing financial statements to evaluate investment  opportunities... it creates financial modeling for investors as well as assessing  the performance  of stock and other types of bonds....  considering the fact that i am studying both  accounting  and economics , this would be  a very good programmer for me.. I have taken an interest in it as I am fascinated by the whole idea of getting involved in analysing financial risks...
17/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Economic consultancy also involves analysis however in this case we are analysing business organizations , Economic statuses  and proposing plans to help improve and change their existing programs..... a functioning program is good ,  however and improved and more innovated  one is even better, which is what I would mainly focuse on doing if I became  an economic consultant , helping programs improve .This is also something I've taken a liking in  because I  still  get to do what I love most , " helping those who cannot help themselves "  better referred to as "service " because I think service does not always have to be social ..it can be financial as well
17/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 880 8732: In market research, I would study consumer preferences , Business conditions and other factors to asses potential sale or service. Marketing  is an interesting point of study and as a market researcher i would not only get the opportunity   to discover what people really want, but I  would also get  to  better understand  the market as well as persuade them to purchase different products . I would also get to help business grow their market share and enjoy better economies of scale as they would now have been  made aware of how to better approach  the market and how to gain from it
17/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Munotida. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
18/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 880 8732: I'm not really sure but  I'm guessing  around 5000 U.S.  dollars  per semester
18/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Munotida! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
18/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
18/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 281 8256: How much does it cost on average  to fly  from Zim to India and how much would  it cost in total  including fees and flights
18/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Nolene!
18/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not flight tickets because the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe once or twice, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So, they learn and do internships during breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
(air fare :-around $400) is to be borne by the student which is mostly a one time investment.
18/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Hi
18/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, please.
18/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I read that
18/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. May I know whether you think that it is affordable, please?
18/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Not trying g to be negative  how are the chances of one getting  the 90% to 100% scholarship
18/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 281 8256: How high sorry
18/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. Additionally, his/her academic results, his/her O level, and A level results
18/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I do think that is affordable  but  may be with a payment plan  if it permissible
18/11/23, 10:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year.
18/11/23, 10:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However. You will be glad to know that our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
20/11/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 880 8732: Yes
20/11/23, 11:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Munotida!
20/11/23, 11:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Munotida and Mrs. Nolene. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 11:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Sorry I had a busy day today can I respond later
20/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mrs. Nolene. I would like to inform you that Munotida can continue with the session in your absence. May I know whether she is available for the session right now, please?
20/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I am still at work
20/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I will ask her
20/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I appreciate your sincerity, Mrs. Nolene! I will be waiting for your response.
20/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Yes I think it will be beneficial
20/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Hello
20/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Good evening sir. Please bear with  us , we have no Wi-Fi  so we use  mobile data and when there is no electricity  our network  is weak
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Munotida. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Yes I understand
20/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
20/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 880 8732: The third point
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

21/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 880 8732: My parents will answer this
21/11/23, 11:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Munotida!
21/11/23, 11:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Munotida. I will be waiting for their response.
21/11/23, 4:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
21/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Hi
21/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 281 8256: My worry  is on the earning  while you learn program  does  it not affect  the edoofa beneficiary  in terms of results and performance  do we have an assurance that our child  won't  be affected and not have time to live a normal student. Would she then  find  to socialise and hang out with other students as a counselor  I understand  how important  it is for a student to have a balanced life  wouldn't  it not be a school work  sleep scenario

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
22/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Yes
22/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Good day
22/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Nolene!
22/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. I would like to inform you that EWYL won't conflict with a student's classes. He/she will have the opportunity to take on projects during his/her free time and create a timetable for these projects based on his/her convenience!
22/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Yes I am and I hope you are too
22/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Okay
22/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Studying  abroad has a lot of advantages  as highlighted  above   would certainly  want  our child to have this opportunity but obviously  the is need for preparation and planning so that  we will be able to support our child  and not struggle midway. Yes you have highlighted  the various payment options  but Zimbabwe's economy is not stable right now people are earning  zim dollars also known  as rtgs dollars which  you would  then  need to exchange  for the us dollar  on the black market and the rates keep escalating  for example  one million rtgs cannot buy you a thousand dollars  yet  people  are earning  less than a million  and a little  but if us dollar  as covid allowance
22/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Bit of
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. We have had a longstanding partnership with schools in Zimbabwe spanning over six years, during which we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the economic conditions in the country. I am interested to hear your perspective on whether you anticipate any changes in these conditions. As mentioned earlier, the opportunity to study in India is truly remarkable, and we have witnessed numerous international students eager to pursue their education in India.
22/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I can't really  say I  expect any positive  change but this fluctuation is on going so we will see how it goes
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Although the idea is still appealing  and we will do the best we can to support financially
22/11/23, 5:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Nolene! Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents.
22/11/23, 5:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 281 8256: That's  basically  it I think  a valid passport  obviously and I am not sure if some institutions require a bank  statement  ,results  of the applicant
22/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
22/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
22/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
22/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 281 8256: That  is so relieving!! So when would be the best time to apply for a student who wishes to begin In 2025
22/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. You will be glad to know that we are accepting students for the 2025 intake!
22/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Oh but we are not yet ready to apply now  because there are exam  fees to think about  and first term fees  for my  three other children
22/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Thanks  noted
22/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 281 8256: We will then contact  you as soon as we clear our backlog
22/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your messages, Mrs. Nolene?
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I was saying we not ready yet for now  since we have fees for the other three which needs to be paid first  so may be the question  would be when is the dead line for applications
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. If the student is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350. However, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Noted
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 281 8256: You did not share with me the deadlines
22/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. As previously mentioned, the payment initiation is expected to take place once the student has been officially selected by the board, please.
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Well I did understand  that  Edoofa  has an option  to pay 200 and  150 after 30 days also edoofa  offers  a reduced processing  fee of 750 instead of paying more than 1350 to 1750
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Which is reasonable
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Alright
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Dead lines please
22/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Nolene. You can expect somewhere around the beginning of December, please. That is for the first $200.
22/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Noted
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 281 8256: I have understood  everything thank you very much.  Do you have any cut off points  at A level  because I understand the process happens before the exams are written and the results are even  out
22/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
22/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 281 8256: What  happens when  you have  done the process  then you fall short  in terms  of points
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, Mrs. Nolene.
22/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Thanks  I think  I had missed that
22/11/23, 8:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Munotida Gillian Makumbi Edoofa (10/11) SZ" to "Munotida Gillian Makumbi Edoofa (10/11) SZ 2025"

22/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 281 8256: Can  I respond tomorrow  because we had a power  cut and  phone battery  is dying
22/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Nolene. May I know whether you are available for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session?
22/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
23/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 880 8732: Yes
23/11/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Munotida!
23/11/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
23/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 880 8732: Yes I have
23/11/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Munotida!
23/11/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly tell me which stage you are at in your application right now?
23/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 880 8732: The first one
23/11/23, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Yes
23/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 880 8732: Yes
23/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
