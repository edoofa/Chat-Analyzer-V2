05/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 181 2322: Hey Mr Gurvinder
05/12/23, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: Audrey, Can you please tell me in which class you are in right now?
05/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 181 2322: Form 4
05/12/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now you have decided to pursue O-level?
05/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes
05/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Thank you
05/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 181 2322: May you brief me about the Edoofa schoolarship
05/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Thank you
05/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 181 2322: How many subjects should l pass to obtain the schoolarship
05/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 181 2322: so how about If u haven't done the A level ...but did the O level
05/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I haven't done A level am my O level now
05/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Audrey, first complete your O-level and then contact us again for the scholarship.
05/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay Thank you
05/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I have completed my O level am currently waiting for the results
05/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Then what does this mean?
05/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: This indicates that you have to do O-level next year.
05/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: And that is why I did not started your counselling session.
