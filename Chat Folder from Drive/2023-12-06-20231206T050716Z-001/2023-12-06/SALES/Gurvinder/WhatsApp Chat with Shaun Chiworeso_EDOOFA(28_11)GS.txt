29/11/23, 8:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Shaun, and Mr.Lazarus Chiworeso!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 78 288 5102: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shaun,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 368 6228: Good morning. I am Mr Chiworeso, its my pleasure to join this interactive discussion

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Shaun, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
30/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Good afternoon sir.
I apologise for my delay in communication and any further inconveniences caused on your side.

But as of now, I can guarantee you I am available for discussion
30/11/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Very well sir I understand.
Enjoy the rest of your day😊

01/12/23, 8:16 am - +263 78 288 5102: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
01/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
01/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Shaun, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Hester, is that correct?
01/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 288 5102: That is correct sir
01/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Hester, also do tell me whether you learnt about Hester’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Unfortunately Hester and I rarely communicated. The only time we got in touch was when he briefed me about the Edoofa Programme and helped me fill out these documents.
01/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Definitely, I've heard about the programme before and it's something I have always admired
01/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Thank you sir for the briefing
02/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Shaun, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
02/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
02/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 288 5102: I'll do my best on my part Mr Gurvinder. Thank you so much
02/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Shaun, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
02/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 288 5102: I'm a seventeen year old Zimbabwean born young man who completed his O Level studies with 8 A's and 5 B's in 2022 at Uzumba High School. After completion, I proceeded to take a gap year, and attend a one-year leadership programme at STAR Leadership Academy (SLA). <This message was edited>

05/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Shaun, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
