*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 8:45 am - +260 760701892: Good morning.
Can't wait for the meeting!
05/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 760701892: Good morning, all ready here. It's 9AM!
05/12/23, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Wana,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/12/23, 9:20 am - +260 760701892: Thank you Mr Gurvinder, it's a pleasure to connect with you and the rest of your board.
05/12/23, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Wana, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tapiwanashe, is that correct?
05/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 760701892: No, I got to know if from Francine Chilabi.
05/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Francine, also do tell me whether you learnt about Francine’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 760701892: Well, she told me this is a scholarship board and not sponsorship and all scholarships are all merit based, and no, I didn't learn about her journey.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 760701892: Well thanks very much for the briefing
05/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 760701892: Yes that is right
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Wana, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 10:38 am - +260 760701892: No I don't think I have what it takes to get a high quantum of scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: And may I know why is that?
05/12/23, 11:46 am - +260 760701892: Well that's because both of my parents are rarely home, they are usually at farm outside town were network is poor, they usually just during weekends.
That may affect the the second point on parent participation.
05/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let us continue the counseling session and I hope you will discuss with them about the session.
05/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now Wana, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/12/23, 12:31 pm - +260 760701892: Am an 18 year old Zambian citizen who completed secondary school last year at Hillcrest National Secondary School.

My father is not working, he retired in March,2023 after attaining the retirement age. My mum is the only one working as a teacher. Both my parents have been to college. 
My parents have been supporting my education from the beginning upto the end of my senior secondary. Well for education abroad is still a question mark on who will sponsor.
