30/11/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
30/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 916 5512: Yes sir
30/11/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
30/11/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 916 5512: Definitely
Im very confident about achieving it
30/11/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the course now?
30/11/23, 4:50 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

05/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 916 5512: Well after 5 years i see my self as the man that i always wanted to be, living happily as i would have made it in my education. With the type of hard working man that i am , many firms would be happy and hounored to use my expertise and knowledge in operating their firm.If i happen to learn under this program in India ,i would be happy to be also fully employed there and that would also be a sign of me giving back and appreciating the community that would have moulded me into the person that i would be after finishing my course there.

I am certain that if i do the course that i want to do i will a job that does not only make me financially balanced but will also make me happy because i would be passionate about it and therefore that job would make me build an empire that I've always dreamt of. I also see my self helping other fellow young people in Africa particularly in my country who are not stable financially to cover for their studies

After attaining my degree i also see myself developing through striving for higher education like undergoing a postgraduate degree that would be a masters degree so that i can get the opportunity to get employed in more higher ranks
05/12/23, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Delight, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 916 5512: Yes im willing
05/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 916 5512: Learning in a country that is not mine will give me the chance to know a different culture, a different languages and a different way of living compared to my country.it would be an opportunity to tour outside my country anf learn the world
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
