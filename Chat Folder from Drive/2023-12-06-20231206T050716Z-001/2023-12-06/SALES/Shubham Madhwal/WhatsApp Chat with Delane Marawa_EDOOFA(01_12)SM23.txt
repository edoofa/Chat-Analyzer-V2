I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Delane 

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - ~ DELANE added +44 7901 120155
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - +27 73 429 5911: How are you I am Mr Marawa,, Delane's father
04/12/23, 3:28 pm - +27 73 429 5911: Well sir I don't have any understanding about it,,, maybe you can elaborate more about the program
04/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
04/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
04/12/23, 3:56 pm - +27 73 429 5911: Thank you,,, so how many programs are there
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
