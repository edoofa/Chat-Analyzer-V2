27/09/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Science in Optometry : What is it about?


*Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.

*"We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 308 4446: That's a really great question. There are a number of reasons why people may choose to study abroad instead of in their home country. For one, studying abroad can offer a unique cultural experience that can be very enriching and eye-opening. Additionally, some people may choose to study abroad in order to improve their language skills or to gain a better understanding of another country's culture. Finally, for some people, studying abroad may be the only way to get the education or training they need to pursue their career goals.
What about you? What would you say are the benefits of studying abroad?
16/10/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?*
16/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Not yet
16/10/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, I understand that basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad, so if you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship which would help you have the kind of exposure you are aiming to have, Can you tell me about how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
16/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 308 4446: That's a really great question, and one that is becoming increasingly relevant as more and more people choose to study abroad. There are a number of ways that one could use the knowledge and experience gained from studying abroad to benefit the education system in their home country. For example, they could:
- Share their knowledge and experiences with other students and teachers in their home country;
- Serve as a mentor or advisor to students who are interested in studying abroad;
- Work to improve the quality of education in their home country by implementing some of the best practices they learned while studying abroad;
16/10/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
16/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Yes sir
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
16/10/23, 6:46 pm - Gurvinder: Dear Students and Parents,

I hope this message finds you well.

 I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*

Let's have a discussion tonight. Your success is our top priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. *Usually, my working hours are over by now, but I'm extending them to accommodate your needs.*
16/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 308 4446: It's okay sir
16/10/23, 7:12 pm - Gurvinder: Kindly respond to this question so that we can proceed ahead!
16/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Okay sir
16/10/23, 7:57 pm - Gurvinder: @263783084446 I am waiting for your reply
16/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 308 4446: I am aware that India has a long history of higher education, dating back to the ancient universities of Taxila and Nalanda. Today, India is home to some of the best universities in the world, such as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Management (IIM). Furthermore, I know that India is a multicultural country with a rich cultural heritage. This makes it an ideal destination for those who are interested in learning about different cultures and traditions. Additionally, the cost of living in India is relatively low compared to other countries, making it an affordable option for students.
16/10/23, 8:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is great to know that you have researched Leon
16/10/23, 8:03 pm - Gurvinder: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

16/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Thank you sir
16/10/23, 8:28 pm - Gurvinder: May I know if you understood everything properly?
16/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 308 4446: I'm going through everything
16/10/23, 8:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 308 4446: No
16/10/23, 8:53 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
16/10/23, 8:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/10/23, 8:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Okay sir
16/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 308 4446: I think this is for the best
16/10/23, 9:43 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
16/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 308 4446: Yes can you brief
16/10/23, 9:50 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/10/23, 9:50 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 308 4446: This is great sir
16/10/23, 9:54 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/10/23, 9:54 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
16/10/23, 9:54 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 308 4446: I think the information and insights you've shared are very valuable, and can certainly help students make the most of their education. This kind of training and guidance is not typically offered at universities, so the fact that Edoofa provides this is a major benefit. Having this kind of extra support can make a big difference in terms of success after graduation.

I would agree that this kind of program can help differentiate Edoofians from other graduates, and can give them a competitive edge in the job market. The fact that the program is specifically designed to help students develop the skills and mindset needed for success is a major plus.
16/10/23, 9:57 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 9:57 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 9:58 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/10/23, 11:06 pm - Gurvinder: @263783084446 are we connected?
16/10/23, 11:11 pm - Gurvinder: @263783084446 I am waiting for your response!
16/10/23, 11:13 pm - +263 77 952 8180: Sorry sir....it seems our network is bad maybe that's why he is not responding
16/10/23, 11:13 pm - Gurvinder: I can understand, @263779528180
16/10/23, 11:13 pm - Gurvinder: Are you available for next 15-20 minutes?
16/10/23, 11:23 pm - Gurvinder: I was expecting your response but it's been quite a day, and my work hours have come to a close. Let's pick up where we left off tomorrow at 10 AM CAT with fresh energy and ideas.

Have a restful night,
Blessings to you!

P.S. Feel free to check out this link
https://youtu.be/iem55vAdMCE
16/10/23, 11:26 pm - +263 77 952 8180: Network problem ......will continue tomorrow
17/10/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 308 4446: Morning sir
17/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 952 8180: 🤚Present and good morning
17/10/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: Alright, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 308 4446: I'm ready
17/10/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Leon, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 308 4446: Okay
17/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 308 4446: $1500_$2250
17/10/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/10/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 308 4446: Okay sir
17/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 308 4446: This is great
17/10/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
17/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 308 4446: I do
17/10/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/10/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Leon, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
17/10/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 952 8180: very clear and well  understood
17/10/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
17/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 952 8180: i have understood sir
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

23/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 952 8180: 6. the answer to this is yes ,I understand many multinational companies have their headquarters or branches in India and they often look at for candidates who have studied in India because they have a better understanding in terms of language and culture .Moreover ,the skills and knowledge gained through studying in India can be valuable in the workplace.
23/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 952 8180: good morning sir how are you
23/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 952 8180: 7.yes all clear
23/11/23, 9:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: *@263779528180* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Leon* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Leon's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
23/11/23, 9:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *29th or 30th of November 2023* for $200 and the *29th or 30th of December 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *29th or 30th of November 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 952 8180: I think i will opt for the first one and yes i am prepared for that
23/11/23, 10:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263779528180* are you willing to follow the seven-day enrollment fee payment deadline protocol, In case *Leon* gets selected into the program?

*Please answer in a Voice note format*
23/11/23, 5:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

04/12/23, 4:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
