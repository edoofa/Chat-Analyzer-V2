We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I can discuss regarding the same with you!
10/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 091 6649: Good  day sir

10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Limuere, before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
10/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 091 6649: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is a scholarship initiative that aims to provide financial support to deserving students from all over the world. The program offers scholarships for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in various fields of study, such as business, and more. Edoofa focuses on connecting students with universities and colleges that suit their academic goals and aspirations.


The Edoofa Scholarship Program aims to empower students and provide them with opportunities to pursue their dreams and achieve their educational goals.  That is what I understand from the program
10/10/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program*

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
10/10/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.

In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
16/10/23, 10:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

16/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 091 6649: Okay sir
16/10/23, 10:09 pm - Gurvinder: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
16/10/23, 10:10 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
16/10/23, 10:10 pm - Gurvinder: To further Add on the Point 5th Mentioned above
 *Recommendation from Edoofa*

In simple words Limuere what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 091 6649: I'm following sir
16/10/23, 10:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
16/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 091 6649: Yes please
16/10/23, 10:22 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
16/10/23, 10:22 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 091 6649: Okay sir
16/10/23, 10:33 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/10/23, 10:33 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
16/10/23, 10:33 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

17/10/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
17/10/23, 5:17 pm - Gurvinder: Hello, I hope you are doing well.
Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.
Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Hi, I hope you are in good health.
I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed in your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

20/10/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"In order for the light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
20/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 091 6649: Okay sir
20/10/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 091 6649: Yes sir I will surely benefit from this
20/10/23, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/10/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
21/10/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: Greeting @263780916649 @263776418805

23/10/23, 10:07 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Limuere and Ms Chamunorwa @263780916649 @263776418805 

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
23/10/23, 5:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Greetings,
Tomorrow we celebrate *Dusherra*, which is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. Hence we will connect for our session on Wednesday at 10:00 AM CAT.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage and that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.*
