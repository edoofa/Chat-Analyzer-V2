28/11/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Ancilla, Mrs.Fiona Midzi!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
28/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 943 6679: Okay please go ahead
28/11/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Ancilla,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 943 6679: Okay
28/11/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Ancilla, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Gombe, is that correct? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 943 6679: Yes Sir
28/11/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Gombe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Gombe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 943 6679: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 943 6679: Thank u so much for getting in touch with me 
My English is not that good so please bear with me 

When l first heard about you l thought it was a scam but Gombe told me that with you l have an opportunity to further my education at a low cost

She told me that in India students value their education so much that they can access internet at low costs different from Zimbabwe were costs are high

She also told me that l have an opportunity to earn money during my courses which is really helpful as l have to support my mother
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: I see you are well-informed Ancilla.
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir that's correct
28/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ancilla, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
28/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir
28/11/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Ancilla, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
28/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 943 6679: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear about your father Ancilla.
28/11/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 943 6679: It's okay Sir
28/11/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Civil engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
28/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 943 6679: I can't really explain it
But from what l heard civil engineering involves road construction and building construction right

So growing up l used help my to go to work. He was blind so l had to help him walk, he always stumble or place a foot in a pothole no matter how careful l was
I would always feel bad and blame myself, so funny thing l made up my mind to fix all those roads and make my father's life easier
Unfortunately life happened but l still dream
28/11/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 943 6679: Then l also want to build houses, to provide people the security they need because deep down my greatest fear is not having a place to stay
So l think civil engineering is a calling more like
28/11/23, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: What a noble cause Ancilla.
28/11/23, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: So Ancilla, could you kindly tell me how much *Chibi High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 943 6679: My mother financially supports me and she is a nurse
Chibi high charges $415 excluding practical fees and levy
When l started school it charged $420 but the fees is continually changing due to inflation
28/11/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
28/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 943 6679: Mr Raymond Ndega
+263 773238228
28/11/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/11/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
28/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 943 6679: No l think l am the first
28/11/23, 11:14 am - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

28/11/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech Civil*
28/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Can you please explain what it is about exactly
28/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Wait l just researched about it and l think it's a great idea sir
28/11/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: let me brief you.
28/11/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
28/11/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field.
28/11/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Wow l had no idea
That's a lot of helpful information thank you so much
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/11/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Really confident Sir
28/11/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, now did you understand the course?
28/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes Sir l did 

When l did my research l understood that B.tech offers me a wide range of opportunities so l think it's a good course
28/11/23, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/11/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Are we connected?
28/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir just give me 10 minutes sir please
28/11/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 943 6679: As a B tech in civil engineering graduate l would see myself as a successful and innovative civil engineer and a source of pride and happiness in my mother's eyes

I would be working on exciting and challenging projects around the world.With the knowledge and skills l gained from my studies l would be able to contribute to the development of cutting edge infrastructure and help to improve the quality of life in my community
Endoofa's program would provide me with the opportunity to study at some of the world's prestigious universities
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Ancilla I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Sir l am willing to give 500% even if it means l have to work 24/7 

I have to do this not only for me but my family as well
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 943 6679: In my country sir there are not that many opportunities available for people
We are continually suffering from inflation and also the fees required by the universities are very high
28/11/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Thank you so much for asking me this question
 The knowledge and experience l gain from studying abroad would be invaluable in helping to improve the education.

I would be able to bring new teaching methods and predagogical approaches that l learned while abroad and implement them in my own teaching

Also l would also be able to start a center where l would teach other students like  myself who come from struggling backgrounds and who are less fortunate
28/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ancilla, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 943 6679: I agree with you Sir
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes
28/11/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/11/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

28/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Wow l had no idea that's really impressive
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ancilla, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 943 6679: No sir
28/11/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 943 6679: I am sorry l don't understand the question but l guess No
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, let me tell you.
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Oh my goodness that is really amazing
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Ancilla what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 943 6679: That's so great your cause is really amazing
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Ancilla, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

28/11/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes l think this will benefit me a lot and it's such a great opportunity
28/11/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
28/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Wow you are so well informed but yes that's correct
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Ancilla, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 943 6679: That's amazing thank you
28/11/23, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ancilla, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes they would be the ones
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes l have but my mother is always worried about my safety and well being
But if l was given an opportunity she would support me
28/11/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Ancilla, India is a welcoming country where foreigners are treated as guests in our home, and once you come to India, our team members will always be available to you, and your mentors will always stay connected with you until the end of your education.
28/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 943 6679: That's really amazing
28/11/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes
28/11/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Ancilla as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 943 6679: $1500-$2250
28/11/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Ancilla, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Okay
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes
28/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Okay
28/11/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Ancilla basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: However Ancilla, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Wow
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 943 6679: No
28/11/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ancilla, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 943 6679: Yes sir
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 943 6679: No sir l think you covered it all
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

04/12/23, 4:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
05/12/23, 6:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
