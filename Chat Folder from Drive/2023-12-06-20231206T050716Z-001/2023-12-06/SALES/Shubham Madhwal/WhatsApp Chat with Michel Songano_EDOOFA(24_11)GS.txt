*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Hie sir l am online now

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 290 4889: OK Mr Gurvinder  and it is a pleasure to connect with you too
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Michel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Nicole, is that correct?
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Yes
24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nicole, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nicole's Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Well l learnt  that Edoofa is indeed the best program.She told me about  the good education in India About her journey she told me about  Enwhile learning and l think l will manage that.
24/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Besides that,l also learnt that Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of all.Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, I see you are well informed, Michel.
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: But let me also brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 290 4889: That's true
24/11/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Michel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Yes
24/11/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Michel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
24/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
24/11/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 290 4889: I am confident
24/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 290 4889: And l am sure that my results that are coming out in January next year are good because l wrote my final exams with passion
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: That is great Michel.
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the course?
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Yes
24/11/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law. This course goes beyond the tedious classroom learning. The time spent during this course is made interesting by constantly organizing the case studies and mock court drills alongside theoretical lectures.

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 290 4889: I did understood
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Yes
24/11/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 290 4889: If I  pursue the LLB program and then become a lawyer, I would see myself as a legal advocate for social justice and equality five years after graduation. I would use my skills to help those who have been wronged by the system, and to fight for change in the legal system. I would also use my skills to educate others about the law and its importance in our society. I believe that Edoofa's program would help me achieve my dreams by providing me with the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful in the legal field. The program's focus on experiential learning and its emphasis on problem-solving  Edoofa's program would give me the opportunity to network with other law students and professionals, which would be invaluable in my career. The program's global perspective would also be valuable, as it would give me a broader understanding of  law and its role in different cultures and societies. I think the combination of all these elements would set me up for success in the legal field and help me achieve my goals.   Edoofa's program would also help me develop the skills I need to be a successful lawyer in today's world.
24/11/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Michel I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 290 4889: I am willing
24/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Michel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Well l am Michel Songano .I am 19 years old .Born on the eighteenth of June 2004.Well l did my A'level at Mvurwi high school and l am the out going head girl of that school. I would like to study law. Well l am a courageous girl,a goal target l dont believe in failure but hardworking. About my weaknesses l tend to overthink sometimes.l am a soccer player.My hobby is dancing. My parents work at work at a farm that is located in Mvurwi. My mother is a house wife and my father is a farm manager.
24/11/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 290 4889: . One reason is that there are limited opportunities for higher education within Zimbabwe, so l want to study abroad in order to get better educational opportunities. Additionally, studying abroad allows me  to gain a more global perspective and to learn about other cultures, which can be beneficial in my  future career. Finally, studying abroad can also be a way to escape the political and economic instability that is present in Zimbabwe since it is shrinking
24/11/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
24/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 290 4889: When l return to Zimbabwe after studying abroad l can  bring back new knowledge and skills that can be shared with other students and teachers. Additionally, l  can help to improve the quality of education in Zimbabwe by advocating for better resources and funding for schools. Finally, by gaining a more global perspective, l can help to make Zimbabwe's educational system more relevant in the 21st century.
25/11/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Michel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
25/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 290 4889: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
25/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 290 4889: I will definitely work hard

25/11/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
25/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 290 4889: That's true
25/11/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

27/11/23, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 290 4889: I have been looking for this
27/11/23, 11:15 am - Gurvinder: Alright Michel, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 290 4889: That's true
27/11/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
27/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 290 4889: I did discussed it with them. They loved it .I told them the benefits of studying in India and that it provides higher education. Since they want the best for me,they are 100% in support with the Edoofa
27/11/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
27/11/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
27/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 290 4889: Yes
27/11/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Michel as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 290 4889: 1500-2 250
27/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Am sorry Mr Gurvinder my network is low for can l finish this task tomol morning .l am going to a place where there is no network problem today
27/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Am sorry Mr Gurvinder my network is low so can l finish this task tomol morning .l am going a place where there is no network problem today.
27/11/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Can we still try to finish this counselling session as I need you to be online for only 10 minutes now.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 290 4889: I am back Mr Gurvinder we can finish now
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Michel, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Thank you
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 290 4889: No
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Michel, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Noted sir
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 290 4889: Yes sir
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 290 4889: No
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
05/12/23, 6:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
