07/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay maybe I am not understanding your question
May you please explain what are you mean
07/09/23, 2:30 pm - +91 82875 72068: That is totally fine, Confidence. Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
07/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes
07/09/23, 2:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
07/09/23, 2:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 2:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
07/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 532 6412: *While* 
That's good
07/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes it's affordable
07/09/23, 2:41 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well moving on, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
07/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 532 6412: No
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
07/09/23, 2:52 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

*"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." — Lao Tzu*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
08/09/23, 12:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media page to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/edoofa/
08/09/23, 2:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
08/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes will be beneficial for me
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

12/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes I comprend
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
12/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?

26/09/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Confidence.
26/09/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
26/09/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
26/09/23, 10:58 am - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 532 6412: It's affordable
Also helps employments while still learning
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 532 6412: It's affordable and a good tertiary education
26/09/23, 3:03 pm - +91 82875 72068: Now I know you focus more on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 532 6412: It's an achievement to me to study abroad
And also my parents they happy for the of Edoofa Scholarship Program in india
26/09/23, 3:12 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mawire, can you please request them to acknowledge this in the group?
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +91 82875 72068: Furthermore, since documents are an intrinsic section of the evaluation. Can you please share your results in the group in a visual format, Confidence?

I hope this message finds you well. We will now connect with you for the upcoming session on *Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023, at 9:00 AM CAT*, where I will provide you with valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship program.

Hence I kindly request you to prepare any questions or topics you'd like to discuss during the session and ensure you are ready to join us promptly at *9:00 AM CAT on Tuesday*. We are committed to assisting you in your educational journey and looking forward to connecting with you.

Are you ready?
03/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes
03/10/23, 12:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence, getting a seat as well as the scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. I would also request you to be diligent with your responses.
03/10/23, 12:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
03/10/23, 7:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 532 6412: Yes I am ready
04/10/23, 10:15 am - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Confidence!
04/10/23, 10:15 am - +91 82875 72068: May I know whether you have comprehended this information?
04/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 532 6412: You're welcome
04/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 532 6412: I think it's only recommendation later and results of High school
04/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 82875 72068: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
04/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 532 6412: Okay
04/10/23, 11:53 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence, may I know whether you think it is affordable, please?
04/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes it's affordable
But may I know whether I have a seat in the application of Edoofa Scholarship
04/10/23, 12:10 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

04/10/23, 9:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Confidence. I had a discussion with the Academic Board regarding your application and there has been a recent development. I would like to inform you that as per the Government Criteria *Biology* is mandatory to pursue a BSc in Agriculture. Since you do not have *Biology* in your subject combination, you are not eligible for the course. May I know whether you have any other course in mind, please?
04/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay
04/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 532 6412: I can do degree in mathematics

04/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 532 6412: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
04/10/23, 9:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence. I kindly request that you use formal language as every response is crucial for the evaluation process. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated.
04/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay I understand
04/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 532 6412: You are welcome
04/10/23, 9:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: I appreciate your sincerity, Confidence. Could you kindly share what inspired your interest in Mathematics? Would you like me to offer guidance on suitable courses?
04/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 532 6412: I'm good in mathematics so I can do degree in mathematics since I can't do agriculture because I can not doing biology
04/10/23, 9:34 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence. I believe you aspire to innovate and implement a holistic and ecologically responsible approach to agriculture. Are you aware that Agriculture is a specific sector or a topic that falls within a humongous domain, i.e., Geography?
04/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes
04/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 532 6412: These why I do crop science, geography and Mathematics

07/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes
07/10/23, 6:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Confidence! Can you please answer this question?
07/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes
07/10/23, 6:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that, Confidence. May I know whether you have comprehended this information, please?
07/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes I have comprehended it
07/10/23, 6:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
07/10/23, 6:49 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay
07/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 532 6412: I understand
07/10/23, 6:52 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
07/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay it's affordable
It's a post payment🤷‍♂️
07/10/23, 6:59 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please elaborate your query, Confidence?
07/10/23, 7:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence. I would request you to be active for the next 15 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
10/10/23, 9:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
11/10/23, 9:42 pm - +91 82875 72068: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.

17/10/23, 2:21 pm - +91 82875 72068: I extend my best wishes for your exams! I would like to kindly inform you that due to the limited availability of seats and the high volume of daily applications, we are adhering to a specific timeline for our sessions. Gaining this scholarship hinges on your motivation and active participation. I conduct a high volume of interviews daily, sometimes exceeding 100, and my time is limited. Therefore, it's crucial for both you and your parents to display your dedication and enthusiasm for this opportunity. If you're preoccupied with exam preparations, your parents can step in and continue the conversation. <This message was edited>

18/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes it's affordable
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay 
🤷‍♂️ I don't know
18/10/23, 4:15 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Confidence. May I ask whether you have been sincerely following the session, please?
18/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Okay I remember a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would kindly request you to go through these messages again, please.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

When is the due date for paying fees
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Confidence, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please answer this question?
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 532 6412: 01
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 532 6412: Yes explain
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
