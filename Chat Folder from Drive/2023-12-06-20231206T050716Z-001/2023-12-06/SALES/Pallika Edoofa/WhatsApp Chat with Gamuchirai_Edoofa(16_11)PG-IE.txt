I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

04/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 623 0195: 1)  I was motivated by the determination by Edoffa to develop in all sectors  this is because most scholarships have overlooked students majoring in law and focusing only on science based majors but Edoffa is neutral it will give me a platform to continue my studies.
2)I understand that it is a program that offers scholarships to students not only to develop academically but also socially and expose them to a different environment
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Gamuchirai, Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.
