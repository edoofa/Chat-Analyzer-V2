Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for Vuyisile's career, aren't you?* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Definitely
23/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Ms. Khumalo
23/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that he receives access to the best opportunities?
23/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Nothing much, was hoping there's some sponsorship involved with your program
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 274 1769: It's ok
23/11/23, 8:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Network is bad once we lose electricity. Will be ready tomorrow at 1230
24/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Sorry was at work, just knocked off. I'm ready now
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo, 

How is your day progressing?
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 274 1769: The heat is killing us here
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the hot weather is quiet uncomfortable!!
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo, Continuing the discussion, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that hereceives access to the best opportunities?
24/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Let us know the opportunities then where our input is required we will make a plan
24/11/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 274 1769: It depends on the fees
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this
24/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Yes I did go through, I can't say I will afford when I don't know how much fees cost
24/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 274 1769: U hv mentioned that u only cater for at least 50% fees but I want to know it's 50% of how much
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from approx *$6000-$8000 per year* in India, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to approx *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity.


Will you now be able to manage? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Could try
24/11/23, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, It's reassuring to hear your perspective, Ms. Khumalo. I want to emphasize that the initial investment is a one-time commitment. Once Vuyisile is enrolled in the program, his Admission and Earning While You Learn (EWYL) process will kick off immediately. Through dedicated effort, he'll be earning approximately $50-$100 in scholarship credits monthly. This not only eases the financial load but empowers Vuyisile to actively contribute to his higher education expenses. It's a sustainable approach that aligns with our commitment to making education accessible. Your trust in this process is truly appreciated, and we're excited to support Vuyisile on his educational journey.
24/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Thank you
24/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 274 1769: If I may ask what kind of jobs do these students do
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
24/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Great

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin with your session?
27/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Yes sir
27/11/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?

27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 863 0867: Literature in English - B
History - C
Family and religious studies - C
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I understand
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I did, I looked into a number of universities in countries such as South Africa and Zambia, to name a few
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 863 0867: Okay
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I am and so is my family
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vuyisile, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I can't say for sure
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You can have a discussion with your family regarding this, Vuyisile, Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

02/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 274 1769: Sounds good
02/12/23, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo
02/12/23, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

02/12/23, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is, Ms. Khumalo
02/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Moving further, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 274 1769: It is a great opportunity
02/12/23, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
02/12/23, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
02/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 274 1769: I think you just mentioned all, guess the birth records are bunched with 1.
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, I have listed the main requirements
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
02/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Yes
02/12/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/12/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

02/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 274 1769: I thought you were still to give more information, I don't know what I was supposed to respond to. Had read the information of how much is to be paid as enrollment fees
04/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session now?

05/12/23, 8:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you are doing well today,

Shall we begin the session now?
05/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 274 1769: Yes
05/12/23, 8:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
05/12/23, 8:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 274 1769: I'm fine
05/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 274 1769: Ok noted
05/12/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 274 1769: Stage 2
05/12/23, 9:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 274 1769: Yes
05/12/23, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/12/23, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
05/12/23, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/12/23, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
05/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 274 1769: Yes
05/12/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
