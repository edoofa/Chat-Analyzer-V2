So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 557 5509: Studying computer science in India can have a number of positive impacts on one's career. Firstly, India is a global hub for technology, so as an Edoofian graduate of computer science programs in India i will be well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities in the tech industry. Secondly, the cost of studying computer science in India as an Edoofian is relatively low, making it an attractive option. Finally, many Indian universities offer excellent curricula and teaching staff, so students can be assured of receiving a high-quality education. So, studying computer science in India can be a great way to set myself up for a successful career in the tech.
16/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 557 5509: yes,picked up some information on the FAQ document.
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Absolutely! Your insights into studying computer science in India as an Edoofian are well-founded. The global tech hub status, cost-effectiveness, and the high-quality education offered by Indian universities indeed make it a compelling choice. Your awareness of these factors reflects a solid understanding of the positive impacts such a decision can have on one's career.
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 557 5509: Yes the installments make it more affordable.
16/11/23, 6:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
16/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 557 5509: am so sorry my network went bad.
16/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 557 5509: I don't really know about it ,but is it the earn while you learn program
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's absolutely right!!
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 557 5509: From what I've understood,i think i will *very much benefit*.
As the name says Earn while you learn,its much of a win win situation.
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 557 5509: Noted.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 557 5509: That's actually wonderful.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is, Tinotenda, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
16/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 557 5509: 3 & 4 both sound wonderful.
16/11/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge* and *Earn While You Learn*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

16/11/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 557 5509: My mother will be helping.
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, Tinotenda
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 557 5509: My family feels comfortable with me studying abroad.
16/11/23, 7:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
16/11/23, 7:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
16/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 557 5509: That's one of the goals.
16/11/23, 7:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate that!!
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 557 5509: That's it.
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
16/11/23, 7:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
16/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
16/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 557 5509: you may explain.
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tinotenda
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 7:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 557 5509: All noted.
16/11/23, 7:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
16/11/23, 7:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 557 5509: we have mostly discussed *stage 1* and you also gave me a glimpse of the 5 remaining.
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Tinotenda!!!
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 557 5509: yes you may explain.
16/11/23, 7:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Tinotenda!!
16/11/23, 7:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
16/11/23, 7:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
16/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 557 5509: yes iam.
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, then!!!
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
16/11/23, 8:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

The BCA program typically spans three years, depending on the educational institution and the country. It is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in various aspects of computer science and applications.

Here are some key aspects of a BCA program:

Curriculum: BCA programs usually include a mix of theoretical and practical courses. Common subjects covered include programming languages (such as C++, Java, and Python), database management systems, computer networks, web development, software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and more.

Practical Training: Many BCA programs incorporate practical training through projects, internships, or industrial training, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Elective Specializations: Some BCA programs offer elective specializations in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, mobile application development, and more. These specializations allow students to tailor their education to specific areas of interest.

Project Work: Students often undertake a major project during their final year. This project serves as a culmination of their learning and provides practical experience in solving real-world problems.

Examinations and Assessments: Assessment methods typically include exams, assignments, practical projects, and sometimes viva voce (oral examinations).

Career Opportunities: Graduates with a BCA degree can pursue careers in various fields, such as software development, system analysis, database administration, network administration, web development, and more. They are often hired by IT companies, consulting firms, government agencies, and other organizations.

Further Education: Some BCA graduates choose to pursue higher education, such as a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) or other related fields, to enhance their knowledge and career prospects.

Global Recognition: BCA programs are offered by many universities and colleges worldwide. The curriculum and degree may vary slightly from one institution to another, but the core focus on computer applications remains consistent.

Before enrolling in a BCA program, it's important to research and choose a reputable institution that is recognized for its quality education in computer applications.
