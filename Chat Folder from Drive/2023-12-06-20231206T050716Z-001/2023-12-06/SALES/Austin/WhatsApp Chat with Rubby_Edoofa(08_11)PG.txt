15/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 503 2606: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this.
15/11/23, 4:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I would like to know why the grades are low.
15/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 503 2606: okay Last term I was not doing the extra-lessons because we couldn't afford them
15/11/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rubby, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 503 2606: okay that's Noted Mam and am very much confident in excelling  with flying colors
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 503 2606: No I have not done that yet Mam
15/11/23, 5:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 503 2606: mmmm we were to look on that but for now we are not aware mam
20/11/23, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Okay thank you
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Mam can we  please resume the session tomorrow because some heavy rains just started here
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes I am sure they will afford that mam
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 503 2606: mmmm No  I don't know how its done mam
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, rubby, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

20/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 503 2606: I am very much sure I will benefit from the EWYL Program
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Well explained...thank you for making this understandable for me mam
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're welcome Rubby
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 503 2606: I like point 4 the most mam
20/11/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

20/11/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 503 2606: probably my father mam
20/11/23, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, Rubby, 
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 503 2606: okay thank you mam...My family is really excited for me though I can see that they are a bit scared for me
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Rubby. Sending a child abroad for studies can be daunting for families, yet it presents a life-changing opportunity.
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 503 2606: True
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 503 2606: I agree with you on that mam
20/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 503 2606: That's what I also think is required mam
20/11/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
20/11/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
20/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 503 2606: okay😮‍💨
20/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 503 2606: please do that
20/11/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rubby, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
20/11/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: .Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 503 2606: This is great
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 503 2606: stage 2
20/11/23, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Rubby, 

We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes go ahead mam
20/11/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
20/11/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 503 2606: yes now am clear with it
20/11/23, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Rubby
20/11/23, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rubby, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*

21/11/23, 12:07 pm - Austin: Greetings Mrs Rutendo and Rubby,

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Pallika and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
21/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Greetings to you too Sir...I am ready
21/11/23, 12:43 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Ms Rutendo

I hope you are doing well
21/11/23, 12:43 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
21/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes I have and I thought This Edoofa scholarship program is good and provide good results as for the questions for now I don't have any
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Austin: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes I do
21/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Actually the financial aspects are really affordable but as for us here we have really met a bigger problem which might get in Rubbys way considered she get the opportunity to get the scholarship
21/11/23, 1:03 pm - Austin: Would you like to share the challenge so that I can guide you in the best way possible
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Rubby's father is meeting many problems regarding his job that I don't think he will be able to cater for the needs Sir
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - Austin: I understand and how are you planning to further the education of Rubby considering these challenges?
21/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Mmmmm that's where the bigger problem is so we decided that maybe we should just give up on this program since there is nothing we can do maybe we can afford her doing Her University here in our country
21/11/23, 3:41 pm - Austin: That is indeed a genuine concern but have you compared the cost of education at Zimbabwean universities with that through the Edoofa program?
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes I just did now and I saw that well Am really stressing out now maybe I can just make her do a course or something affordable to our family
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - Austin: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - Austin: @263775032606 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
21/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Okay I understand that and I am also looking forward for such an opportunity for my child's career
21/11/23, 4:15 pm - Austin: This is well noted, If Rubby qualifies for the Edoofa Program, how much time will you require to raise the enrollment fee?
21/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Maybe in 2 weeks Sir considering things are down here especially in Vending
21/11/23, 4:25 pm - Austin: We do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 4:25 pm - Austin: Will the payment plan be feasible for you?
21/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes yes thank you for explaining this
21/11/23, 4:28 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, are you having any questions for me regarding the program as of now?
21/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Mmm no
21/11/23, 4:38 pm - Austin: Noted, is Best available now?
21/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 503 2606: No
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Austin: Noted
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Austin: As you know, A level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Rubby?*
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 503 2606: Yes
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/11/23, 1:26 am - +263 77 503 2606: okay

1. The name of the course she will be studying is B.A in Sociology

2. She will be studying in India through the Edoofa program

3. The average cost of studies in India without a scholarship is $6000-$8000

4. The annual fee will be $2000-$3000

5. Yes , now I am
