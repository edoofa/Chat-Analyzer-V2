22/11/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: Please answer this
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - +27 62 820 6650: 1)I was motivated by a friend who  got a scholarship from Edoofa ,she is now at school studying law so I saw this as an opportunity for me to go to school as well .I learnt from that friend that Edoofa helps in giving students the chance to do their desired courses hence  this pushed me to apply .Moreover this is an amazing opportunity for underprivileged students like me to further their studies.

2)My understanding is that this program gives an opportunity to financially disadvantaged students as it offers  a scholarship .This helps the student to learn without having to worry about the school fees , making the student focus more on studies . Additionally it offers counseling to students .
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of medical lab technology? <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 2:34 pm - +27 62 820 6650: No I do not
22/11/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

Are you pursuing your A level?
22/11/23, 2:43 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I already did last year .
22/11/23, 2:45 pm - Arshita: Can you please share your O level and A level results? 

Pictures will be better
22/11/23, 2:46 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
22/11/23, 2:47 pm - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing.
22/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/11/23, 2:48 pm - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
22/11/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
22/11/23, 2:51 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I did research on foreign education and I tried applying for scholarships in some universities abroad but I did not qualify in most of them because either my country was not eligible or they needed a language proficiency test result.
22/11/23, 2:51 pm - +27 62 820 6650: You are welcome.
22/11/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
22/11/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: Let me once you are done
22/11/23, 2:53 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay thank you
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I am done
22/11/23, 4:00 pm - Arshita: May I know with your interest in medical lab technology why didn't you opt for science at A level?
22/11/23, 5:37 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
22/11/23, 6:32 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I'm sorry I was interupted by electricity but it's back on now .
22/11/23, 6:37 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I wanted to do sciences in A level but they did not allow me to study them since I had not written the subjects in O level .When I was in O level there was a limited number of students who were to register for science subjects and the students had already exceeded that number.Therefore,I could not register for science subjects in O level .
22/11/23, 6:49 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 6:50 pm - Arshita: Since you do not have science you are not eligible for medical. 

At the same time may I know do you have any alternate career aspirations?
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Is this also the same  for nursing ?
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Can I please have the list of the courses I am eligible for ?
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: Yes
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: May I know is there any particular field that you are interested in?
22/11/23, 7:09 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Do you have Social work?
22/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: Yes, we do offer it and you are eligible for the same. 

Shall I explain the course to you?
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes please

*Career Options in Sociology*
Sociology, as a career, is both impactful and fulfilling. Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.

Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:

1. Social Worker
A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.

2. Journalist
For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.

3. Administrative Support
Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.

4. Rehabilitation Counsellor
If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.

5. Family Counsellor
Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.

6. Survey Researcher
As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.

7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist
A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.

8. Policy Analyst
Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population

9. Media Planner
A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
23/11/23, 12:00 pm - +27 62 820 6650: You are welcome.
23/11/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - +27 62 820 6650: On the Indian education system my research showed that education in India is a formality or part of a routine. In India engineering or medicine are compulsory subjects which are done by all students .The Indian education system promotes a balanced approach to education, emphasizing in both academic and extracurricular activities. Moreover , the cost of education in India is relatively low compared to many foreign countries.The  Indian education system is known to be challenging and students are expected to excel in their studies. However, there are challenges like high academic pressure and stress to students . Another challenge is the high student-teacher ratio which prevents teachers from addressing individual learning needs ,thereby hampering the learning process. <This message was edited>

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
23/11/23, 1:04 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I did some research and found out that the cost of higher education for international students without scholarship is affordable to those who can afford it .Thus , to me , I  find it expensive if the student does not have any scholarship .
23/11/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 1:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:06 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
23/11/23, 1:16 pm - +27 62 820 6650: How much is annual fees for social work ?
23/11/23, 1:16 pm - Arshita: Around this
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Is the scholarship included there or not ?
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: Please go through it
23/11/23, 1:20 pm - +27 62 820 6650: How can a student acquire the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM?
23/11/23, 1:21 pm - Arshita: I will be guiding you about that
23/11/23, 1:21 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay I understood .
23/11/23, 1:21 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
23/11/23, 1:21 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
23/11/23, 1:39 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes it may be
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - +27 62 820 6650: No I do not know .
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
23/11/23, 2:01 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I think the Earn While You Learn Program is very beneficial to Edoofian students. It will give me the chance to learn about business, grow and understand the business world .Also it is an opportunity for me to earn money while I learn so I think it will be a  great beneficial program for me .Moreover the webinars will help me understand more about the profession .
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I have , thank you .
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay I understand
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I liked all the 4 points because this had made me understand how helpful and amazing Edoofa is . However, I liked the third point most .
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

23/11/23, 2:15 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you 😊
23/11/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/11/23, 2:26 pm - +27 62 820 6650: My parents.
23/11/23, 2:26 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I will let them know
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
23/11/23, 2:28 pm - +27 62 820 6650: My family feels proud ,they are supportive and  happy that I will be getting quality education at an affordable price .
23/11/23, 2:29 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - +27 62 820 6650: May I ask about social work ,I read what you send yesterday on the course but most of it was about sociology. Does that mean that I will do sociology first then social work ?
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: Sociology covers the aspects of social work
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted .
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 2:35 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes please.
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - Arshita: Please go through it
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +27 62 820 6650: So that means I will be doing social work.
How long does it take?
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - Arshita: Yes
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: 3 years course
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay.
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay this is helpful.
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay thank you
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay well noted.
23/11/23, 2:45 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - +27 62 820 6650: We have discussed the first stage .
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

So shall I explain it to you?
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Yes please
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
23/11/23, 2:54 pm - +27 62 820 6650: If I apply now does that mean that I have to pay $200 within 7 days .
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - +27 62 820 6650: When are the intakes ?
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Once you are selected
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Arshita: After the interview the final results will be out
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Arshita: 2024
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay thank you .
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
23/11/23, 6:10 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.

24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Austin: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
24/11/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 820 6650: You are welcome.
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - +27 62 820 6650: I told them that the Edoofa program offers 50 to 100 percent scholarships to eligible students and the studies are done in India .We also discussed the benefits of the program for instance a student can do a program called Earn While You Learn.This program helps the student to earn money while learning  which makes higher education affordable for the student . Furthermore ,we discussed the benefits of studying in India . In India education is affordable ,it's education is globally recognized,the universities are well ranked and India is home to the World's second largest higher education system.Edoofa offers guidance to  students throughout their journey of higher education and also makes sure that they stay safe. With Edoofa a student will also be assisted in getting a job after graduation. Edoofa also reduced its enrolment fee so that parents are able to pay it and it also offers a flexible fee payment option.Upon being accepted to universities the Edoofa councillors also advise the student on which university to go to .After this discussion my family was satisfied with Edoofa and they hope that I get a scholarship from Edoofa .
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! 

I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career.
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - Austin: So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +27 73 501 5592: Good day esteemed Edoofa members. We are grateful for all the prospects that lie ahead and have been following all the conversations. As a mother who is aspiring to see our daughter being emancipated from poverty and social ills that are affecting our society. I must say we are truly humbled at the prospect that lies ahead.My  question is can she do the Earn While You Learn program starting right now if we do not have the application fee now ?Or we can resume the application once we have the money .
24/11/23, 3:57 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mrs Sifiso!
I hope you are doing well
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Austin: We appreciate your enthusiasm and interest in the Earn While You Learn program. We understand that financial constraints can be challenging.
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - Austin: Please note that the Earn While You Learn Program begins after the enrollment of a student after he/she qualities and receives Acceptance Lette
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - Austin: Are you facing any challenges towards the enrollment fees?
24/11/23, 4:14 pm - +27 73 501 5592: At the moment I am currently unemployed. Therefore, have financial constraints. However, of note the prospect of my child getting an education through a scholarship is greatly appreciated
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Austin: I really understand the challenges, have you considered the payment plan for the enrollment fee?
24/11/23, 4:27 pm - +27 73 501 5592: Can you please elaborate on the payment plan available
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - Austin: As we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 4:42 pm - +27 73 501 5592: Noted with thanks
24/11/23, 4:46 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check stage of Shamine on Monday, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results willl be out which means, if she qualifies the due date for the first part will fall on the first week of December
24/11/23, 4:46 pm - Austin: Are you comfortable with the timeframe?
24/11/23, 4:54 pm - +27 73 501 5592: Yes, we will try our level best
24/11/23, 4:59 pm - Austin: This is well noted, is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program as of now?
24/11/23, 5:00 pm - +27 73 501 5592: So far everything is clear. Thank you so much

30/11/23, 4:18 pm - Arshita: Dear parents @27641727357 @27735015592 , Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*.

30/11/23, 4:19 pm - Arshita: The course is named as BA Sociology
30/11/23, 4:31 pm - +27 64 172 7357: Noted

Are you comfortable with the timeframe?
30/11/23, 5:15 pm - +27 64 172 7357: Unfortunately as the financial situation stands at the moment the second week of December wont be possible.isnt it possible you give us a further 2 weeks

30/11/23, 5:21 pm - Arshita: @27641727357 at Edoofa, we have ensured to reward deserving students with the best possible opportunities. There are 370+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe who arrived in India this year and they are not all from great backgrounds, there have been struggles and sacrifices behind the journey of each Edoofian considering the long-term vision. At the same time, we need to be fair with all applicants and we are experiencing a surge in the number of applications with limited scholarship seats. Therefore, it would be challenging to hold the application of your child for long. But considering your plan for your child's career, if I request our Academic Board for a payment plan in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days, $100 by the 27th of December and the remaining in January if your child qualifies, will it be feasible for you? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 5:24 pm - +27 64 172 7357: That wud be better
30/11/23, 5:27 pm - Arshita: Indeed, so will you be able to honour this plan if your child qualifies?
30/11/23, 5:38 pm - +27 64 172 7357: Will have to find a way to honour that
30/11/23, 5:48 pm - +27 64 172 7357: Im just told you had already made a payment plan with Sifiso so lets rather stick to the one you made with her
30/11/23, 5:49 pm - +27 64 172 7357: The said arrangement is said to have been reached btwn counselor Austin and Sifiso
