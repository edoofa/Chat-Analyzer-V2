02/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Makanyara, how are you planning her education in India considering the financial requirements please?
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 774 2744: That's why l am seeking for a scholarship maybe so that l can be helped
02/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I understand please.
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 774 2744: So what do you sponser between the two
02/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program please.
02/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 774 2744: Ok
02/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries please?
02/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 774 2744: No
02/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: Good evening 

Are you clear regarding the financial aspect please, Mrs Makanyara?
02/12/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

04/12/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
