So shall we start the session?
16/11/23, 9:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 468 2738: How are u sir you can start the session very much appreciated .
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
16/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Alright Felex Machele originates from rural Zaka district under Masvingo Province. I turned 53 years this year. Is a father of 3 children and Blessing being the last born. Highest qualification is Diploma In business management. Left civil service in 2015 . Since then it's proving quite a challenge to push my boy through his education.
As for Blessing I am really challenged by his performance in school. From my analysis he has so much zeal that to me is a self starter when it ,comes to school work.
So my worry is whether he will reach his destination. I read a lot of potential in him that I am unable to support.
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Currently I am helping my spouse Emily who is running a small child care project. Small as it is, we have food on the table. In short that's myself and family.
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I commend you both for your remarkable dedication and contributions, Mr. Felex. Your highest qualification, a Diploma in Business Management, reflects a commitment to personal and professional growth. Leaving the civil service in 2015 and transitioning to support Mrs. Emily in running a small childcare project underscores your adaptability and commitment to community welfare! I have confidence that Blessing is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance! So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Anthony's High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports Blessing's education?
16/11/23, 11:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 547 0092: Aah sorry for the inconvenience. I got tied up and my battery went flat when there was no electricity.
Frankly Blessing school fees has not been easy to pay. St Anthony is charging 440 USD per term for boarding and tuition fees.
 My daughter is also training as a teacher at a local teachers college and we pay around 200 USD per term. So the fees issue has never been smooth sailing.
For Blessing the past 2 years his fees was being paid for by government social welfare program but unfortunately it doesn't cater for boarding school fees.
We felt we could disturb his career path since his former school was not competent enough in Advanced level sciences.
So that's how we came up with the decision to move him to St Anthony.
17/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 547 0092: In short Emily's project is the backbone of our children 's education though it can't stretch farther enough to tackle university fees.
17/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." – Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 547 0092: Ok
17/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 547 0092: Let's begin our session
17/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Felex!
17/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Blessing's education abroad?
17/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok like I have outlined above I can only finance up to the current levels that I am giving. Otherwise anything outside this I find it practically impossible. Hence looking for this kind of sponsorship
17/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
17/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok  I hope I got your explanation and clarification between the two. Anyway my point remains that my ability to sponsor my son to study abroad remains limited. However I believe we need to go through the process. If accepted then  we will see whether the related expenses are within our reach.
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concerns, Mr. Felix. As I have mentioned before, *Edoofa* offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. However, after the scholarship, there is some miscellaneous amount. May I know whether you will be able to help Blessing with that amount, please?
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Certainly yes I need to sacrifice for what is best for him .
17/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Felex and Mrs. Emily. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Blessing's well-being is truly admirable!
17/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 547 0092: We appreciate, thank you sir
17/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of A level?
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 468 2738: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 547 0092: The whole issue of him furthering his education abroad is motivated mainly by opportunities that usually come with interaction at international level.
Whereas our education standards are reasonably competitive exposure to advanced technology in the sciences field is one of the push factors.
In the same vein the majority of our country"s young generation are planning their lives with a global view. I thus feel I need to support his vision by all means possible.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 547 0092: The above results are in respect of his Ordinary level. This year he is in his lower Advanced level. He is completing Advanced level November 2024
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Felex! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say that Blessing has obtained impeccable grades, Mrs. Emily!
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please share his previous term results as well?
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Unfortunately he has gone with his school report  at school
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mrs. Emily. Can you please share the results in a textual format?
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Unfortunately he took his school report back to school since it's a booklet that covers the whole year. Will send him this message so that he can share with us
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 468 2738: I cant recall offhead let me ask him to send the results .
17/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you very much, Mr. Felex and Mrs. Emily. Your co-operation is highly appreciated! In the meantime, can you please share his A-level subject combination? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Ok he is doing Mathematics Biology and Chemistry
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding his career aspirations more vividly?
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 468 2738: From the very time he embarked on science subjects he has clearly shown his ambition to take up Medicine. Otherwise we had suggested other options within the medical field but for now we accepted his intentions to be a Medical doctor. He sees himself as a specialist doctor already
17/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Emily, could you please share why Blessing didn't pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
17/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 468 2738: In Zimbabwe if u want to persue medicine that's MBC
17/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
17/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Usually physics are taken by those in engineering
17/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, Mrs. Emily.
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok surely that's a slight difference in the two education systems. I hope that won't be a critical impediment
17/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Alright alright I realize I hadn't critically interpreted it. Can I guess it implies he doesn't qualify for a Medical course in India🤷‍♂️
17/11/23, 10:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Felex. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Blessing's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
17/11/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 547 0092: I would be greatiful if you can share the options available in line with his combination. Maybe we may help him to realign his focus if need be.
17/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
17/11/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Firstly if you can give a brief on Medical laboratory technology
17/11/23, 10:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Felex. May I know what fascinates you regarding the course, please?
17/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 547 0092: It's that Laboratory scientists are highly regarded and for now they are on demand even within our local industry.

So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

04/12/23, 9:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
04/12/23, 9:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
04/12/23, 10:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 6:55 am - +263 78 006 7384: Olkay lemme acknowledge
05/12/23, 8:05 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes l really feel this is affordable based on their source of I income l think l will able to make it of course with your great help
05/12/23, 8:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes lm ready
05/12/23, 8:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Blessing!
05/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes of course thnka you
05/12/23, 8:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessing. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
05/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes of course
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessing. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
05/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes the EWYL problem will be of great help because not only will it help financially but also will help me build m career through exposure to practical work and gaining experience this help me attain my goal of being a problem solver to all in attended illnesses
05/12/23, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
05/12/23, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
05/12/23, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/12/23, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

05/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
05/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 006 7384: Yes of course l hve really understood and l think it will be of great help to mw
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
05/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Olkay l appreciate that Endoofa is very affordable which give chance to many students to learn , it also good in that it promotes practical work for the learner though employability,also the EWYL program which help to support the leaner financially reducing the coat of education also that Endoofa help it's leaners from the start from application travel guide all in all it stays with its learners throughout their journey of higher education till the end
05/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Blessing! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 006 7384: My favourite is earn while you learn
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 006 7384: They actually feel relieved because they are worried if they will be able to pay for my necessities for tertiary education in line with my goals since it is expensive without a your help with Endoofa
05/12/23, 4:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
05/12/23, 4:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Olkay thats it but also career selection , course and college identification also visa. And fee payment assistance, travel guidance , training and internships too l think that will be fine
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 7:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Olkay l see thank you
05/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Olkay l get it now
05/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Blessing Takunnda Machele Edoofa (15/11) SZ" to "Blessing Takunnda Machele Edoofa (15/11) SZ 2025"
05/12/23, 8:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 006 7384: L think we are ini stage two we finished stage 1
05/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Yes of course
05/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
05/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 006 7384: Yes lm clear with it
05/12/23, 8:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

I am content with your responses and performance so far as a result, let me promote your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.

Your next session is scheduled at 09:00 A.M. CAT tomorrow (“06-12-23”), where I will guide you through the most important *Eligibility Check* after addressing your questions. 

Make sure to be available on time after having a detailed discussion with your family and *It is strongly recommended for parents/guardians of the applicant to be online for the next session as higher education is a family decision.*

Happy Family Discussion
Stay Blessed!
