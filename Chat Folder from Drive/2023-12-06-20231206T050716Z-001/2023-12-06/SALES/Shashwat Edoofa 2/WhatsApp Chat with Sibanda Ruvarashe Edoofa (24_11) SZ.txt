Then after that i decided to proceed and i went to High School to do my Advanced level which form 6 in 2022 and i finished this and im apparently waiting for my results because i finished my exams this month.My combination was History, Family and Religious Studies and Literature in English.

Im interested in studying politics or law in my tertiary education.I have been ambitious about advocating for people, being the voice of the voiceless since i was a child

My hobbies:i always spent the most of my time helping people with online lessons, reading news, watching movies sometimes 

My mother only did her Ordinary level and she is now working as a photographer

So i stay with my mom and siblings right here in Zimbabwe and my dad passed away when my mom was three months pregnant with me

05/12/23, 8:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ruvarashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

05/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/12/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 596 6416: Not so sure,but i think they will afford it
