I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Wednesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
