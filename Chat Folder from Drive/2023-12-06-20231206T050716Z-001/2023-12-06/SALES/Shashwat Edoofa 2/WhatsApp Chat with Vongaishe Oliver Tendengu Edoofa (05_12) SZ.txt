What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I have put a lot of effort during the course of my studies such that my goal to do Acturial Science will be fulfilled.  I am coming from a poor background with my parents who are earning little for sustenance , however,  my wish is for Edoofa to accept me and offer me a fully funded scholarship.
