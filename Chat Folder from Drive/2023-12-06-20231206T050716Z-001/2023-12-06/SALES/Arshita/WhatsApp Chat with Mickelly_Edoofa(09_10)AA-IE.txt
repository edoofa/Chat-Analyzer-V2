11/10/23, 10:52 am - Arshita: I can understand that! 

Should I continue with you?
11/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 149 9307: Yes you can continue
11/10/23, 11:15 am - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
11/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 149 9307: No  I'm not familiar with the cost.
11/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 149 9307: Mickelly was supposed to be at one of the university in India as from August this year bt due to financial constraints l couldn't manage to raise the amount which was needed .That's why she is still applying for a scholarship
11/10/23, 11:30 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/10/23, 11:31 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 11:31 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 149 9307: Ok it's clear to me
11/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 149 9307: The terms and conditions are not bad bt with the situation we are experiencing in Zimbabwe it's very hard to raise that amount .Those children who comes from low income family are the most disadvantaged people .Although they have the potential to do something great in life all their efforts will be invain
11/10/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: I can understand that!
11/10/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
11/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 149 9307: May you explain further
11/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 149 9307: That will be much better
11/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 149 9307: Life it's not easy at all here in Zimbabwe because most families are starving
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
11/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes ,l can see a bright light on the programme Earn while you learn Program.
11/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I have understood the whole concept.
11/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 149 9307: There are a lot of benefits on that program Earn while you earn .
11/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I wish if my child could get that opportunity she would fulfil her passion and boost her life
11/10/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
11/10/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Waal thats great ,,
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/10/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
11/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 149 9307: The point which l like most among the 4 it's number 3
11/10/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

11/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok ,those little amounts they earn is it for the month ..If it is like that still the burden will come back to the parent
11/10/23, 1:04 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 149 9307: No one will help me ,I will keep on doing buying and selling ,bt at times the sales will not come out as l think because of the economic hardships in our country
11/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Moreover Mickelly has  got siblings they need financial aid from us parents for school fees ,food ,clothing and medical issues
11/10/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I will try .
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok well understood
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
11/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok you can sum up
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 149 9307: My battery is about to die
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/10/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: However Mickelly, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok that will be much better
11/10/23, 1:28 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Mickelly did his A level last year and l did send you her results yesterday so you already know her A level results so what will be the next stage
11/10/23, 1:36 pm - Arshita: Noted
11/10/23, 1:36 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 149 9307: So far we have done stage 1
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Mickelly right now is not staying with me she went to another town for a part time job .I can see according to your stages she is suppose to have her personal phone ,so that it will be easy for her to go through all the stages .
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes you can explain
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
11/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 149 9307: This registration fee 500- 1000 ??? I can't understand because u  mentioned about $350 in our discussion which you said $200 is paid within 7 days and 150 after other 30 days which is the next month
11/10/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: $350 is the enrollment fee <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Please go through it once
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 149 9307: So do you mean to say there is enrolment fee and registration  which is needed throught the process during 1st year
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: Not throughout the process. 

It will be paid just once. 

Enroll fee will be paid once your child is selected for the edoofa scholarship program through which he will get a guaranteed 50-100% scholarship. 

Registration fee is just a part of college/ university fee, it is not an extra fee.
11/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok I have understood
11/10/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Are you ready for the same?
12/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Afternoon ,yes I'm ready
12/10/23, 12:11 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Christina

I hope you are doing well
12/10/23, 12:11 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
12/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I'm doing well
12/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 149 9307: My question is let's say l paid enrolment fee and part of registration fee and then l decided my child to quit maybe l failed to meet all the demands needed at your university are u going to refund me my money
12/10/23, 12:27 pm - Austin: Mrs Christina, may you please clarify on the demand needed at university part. What do you think are the demands?
12/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 149 9307: When preparing your child for university there are a lot of things needed like clothing ,processing of visa ,pocket money,air ticket
12/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: In addition stationary and toiletries
12/10/23, 12:51 pm - Austin: That is right and this is the reason we have a timeframe of almost one year for the preparations as the intake of Mickelly is in August-September 2024
12/10/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: After the enrollment now, our Admissions team will be guiding you through the Admissions process step by step so that you have a proper mental and financial preparations for the higher education abroad
12/10/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: In the cases, where you need more time for preparations, you can still opt for the intake after that
12/10/23, 12:53 pm - Austin: In the cases, where Edoofa fails to provide Acceptance Letter from University, the enrollment fees will be refunded
12/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok
12/10/23, 12:56 pm - Austin: Are you having other questions for me?
12/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 149 9307: For today that's all what l wanted to ask.
12/10/23, 12:58 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

So may I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
12/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Financially lm not stable because I'm not working .Self employment is not profitable these days in our country .Almost everyone is hustling so the probability of getting high profits is very low
12/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 149 9307: That amount of enrolment fee and cost of education it seems like it's very little bt even if you give us a time frame  it's very hard to get that lumpsum
12/10/23, 1:20 pm - Austin: This is a genuine concern, Mrs Christina and let me tell you that there are 350+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe who arrived in India just this intake. Now, each student has a journey which involves struggles and sacrifices as the family considered the long-term vision for the learners career!

We are well aware of the economic constraints and hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and our Senior Academician was there for 4 months this year after which he explained the reality in the country where even the staple sadza costs $1 and taxi ride is $1 for a short distance,the internet is also expensive where he spent around $120 per month. Now, there was something important. A few students who chose not to proceed with Edoofa back in 2018 visited and shared the experience where they are currently working in super markets, petrol pumps, buying and selling phones and SIM cards etc while Edoofians are excelling towards their goals. You are well aware of these challenges in the nation and it is the need of the hour to step up to secure the career of Mickelly
12/10/23, 1:21 pm - Austin: We also have the Earn While You Learn Program that would futher assist Mickelly to reduce the costs based on her efforts and consistency under the guidance of our EWYL team
12/10/23, 1:21 pm - Austin: Each day, we are working to make a difference in the lives of Edoofians. A combined effort by the family and the learner will not just result in quality education that is affordable, but also, the child being job-ready with employability skills, towards graduation. I believe our vision aligns with what you have for your child.
12/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I will try even though things are tough
12/10/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: I understand and appreciate your willingness to invest in your child's career
12/10/23, 1:42 pm - Austin: So Mickelly, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

Are you clear about the same?
12/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 149 9307: The course she will be studying is Law .l don't know if you offer international law

12/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 149 9307: 6.Earn While You Learn is a situation whereby companies joined hands together with Edoofa to recruit and hire young Edoofians to do projects online which will help them to gain experience while getting opportunity to earn scholarship credits .These scholarship credits will be equivalent to physical cash. Scholarship credits will be based on student performance.That cash is used to pay off part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable

12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 149 9307: *once mentioned about $1500- 2300
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - Austin: This is the normal reduction through the program but based on the evaluations, we refer applicants for a higher quantum of scholarship which would reduce the costs further to $1500-$2300 per annum
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Austin: You will get to know the same if your child qualifies for the Edoofa program!
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok l have understood

12/10/23, 8:04 pm - Austin: I get the intensity of the struggles you are going through and I would suggest that you can let me know once you are prepared to proceed ahead, that is in November

01/11/23, 7:20 am - +263 77 149 9307: How are you the team of Edofa
01/11/23, 7:48 pm - Austin: Good Evening Mrs Christina!  @263771499307 

How are you doing?
01/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I am doing fine
01/11/23, 7:49 pm - Austin: Glad to hear that
01/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 149 9307: My apology my phone was not working since our last chat but I'm now having a new phone
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 149 9307: We are now in November ,I had promised to do my payment of enrolment fee this month ,so I will be happy if you can take me from where we left last month
01/11/23, 8:16 pm - Austin: I do understand, Mrs Christina!
01/11/23, 8:16 pm - Austin: Sure, that would be fine
01/11/23, 8:17 pm - Austin: As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Mickelly?*
01/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes I'm willing ,bt Mickelly 's case is different from those ones at school because she is a school leaver and very soon she will be having her personal phone.On Saturday evening we will be together .She is travelling from where she is to Harare
01/11/23, 8:23 pm - Austin: This is well noted, so which day will she be available for the interview?
01/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Saturday evening or Sunday morning because she will be going on that Sunday in the afternoon
01/11/23, 8:32 pm - Austin: Noted, and will she be available after that?
01/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: From that Sunday she will let you know the time she will be free for interviews because l understand during the day she will be busy at work where she is doing part time job in a town called Masvingo.
01/11/23, 8:34 pm - Austin: I am very familiar with the Masvingo Province because we are associated with schools and Educationists from the province

We have Madam Aleta, Education Inspector, Bikita whose child is an Edoofian. The retired Educationalist-Sir Charles Jerera, who had been working with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Local Government and retired from the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Recreation is our associate.

We hosted counselling sessions for *Chiredzi High School under Mr Zwada, the school Head from which 3 Edoofians are studying in India now including the children of two teachers*, Tungwane High is our associate school with the child of the Head studying in India. We are associated with Zaka High under Mr Museba who took part at our Harare Education Summit as well and have two former students of St Anthony's here in India(with more than 40 qualifiers). The sessions were hosted for, Dewure High(the child of the Head is an Edoofian), Masvingo Christian College, Pamushana High etc and we have students from these schools here in India studying under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/11/23, 8:34 pm - Austin: *From the left, Mr Avreen Singh, Director at Edoofa and Registrar of Scholarships, Madam Aleta Makomeke, the Education Inspector of Bikita -Masvingo, Mr Jerera and Mrs Jerera. The visit took place in June,last year*
