09/11/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
09/11/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

09/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Very interesting. It's insightful
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
09/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 269 3957: No, can you take me through.
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 269 3957: How is it done?
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 269 3957: I will benefit a lot. Gaining experience and exposure whilst I learn.
09/11/23, 2:12 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
09/11/23, 2:12 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes, it's even more clearer now
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Point 4
09/11/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

09/11/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
09/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Great, it's encouraging.
09/11/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Sorry, I had a network challenge
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Arshita: I can understand the challenge
09/11/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 269 3957: In addition to what you have stated above you have to be fully aware whether what you are applying for will meet your career goals.

In planning you also need to check on the affordability of tuition and everything else associated with your stay there.

You also need to check on the country environment, that is, economically and politically.
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes you can
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Well noted
09/11/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
09/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Notec
09/11/23, 3:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 269 3957: We discussed in detail stage 1, though you have also highlighted on all those other stages.
09/11/23, 3:14 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes
09/11/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
09/11/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/11/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
09/11/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
09/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 269 3957: It's clear
09/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 269 3957: I believe that whenever I need clarity I will post
09/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Post it here
09/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

10/11/23, 12:02 pm - Austin: Greetings Mr&Mrs Nyambiri and Tawananyasha,

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Arshita and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
10/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes sir
10/11/23, 12:18 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mr Nyambiri

I hope you are doing well
10/11/23, 12:18 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
10/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Thank you, I think Edoofa is one of the best organised scholarship program because from stage 1 you don't move with assumption. The processes are very clear and understandable.
10/11/23, 12:27 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
10/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes
10/11/23, 12:29 pm - Austin: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
10/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 269 3957: From the what I got, I think with those flexible terms we will try our best to raise the enrolment fees. As for the cost of education, i think with the assistance of Earn while you learn facility, we will also sacrifice our few resources to make sure that it's paid for.
10/11/23, 12:50 pm - Austin: Indeed, I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
10/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 269 3957: I think that's an obligation for every parent.
10/11/23, 1:07 pm - Austin: Indeed, is Tawananyasha available for a discussion?
10/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 269 3957: No, she is not available today until the 16th of November 2023. She has got some examinations. 

I don't know if it is fine with you to get in touch with her starting on the 17th she will be home.
10/11/23, 1:39 pm - Austin: I do understand since we have a lot of applicants waiting for their counselling and evaluation sessions, we are currently having a packed schedule. We do understand the students are currently busy with exams and preparations. Therefore, parents are allowed to take part in the eligibility check stage where they will be interacting with our Program Director over a video call. Are you willing to take part in it?
10/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 269 3957: Yes I am
10/11/23, 2:25 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
Can you tell me?

2. In which country will she be studying through the Edoofa program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

17/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 380 0112: How are you sir today?
17/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Very well.
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mrs Nyambiri!
I am doing well by the Grace of God
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - Austin: We are really glad that your child qualified for the Edoofa scholarship Program. We look forward to her as a proud Edoofian fulfilling her career goals through this opportunity
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Wonderful
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Sure, am really glad too.
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - Austin: Great, so are you having any questions for me regarding the Acceptance Letter?
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Yes, usually how long does it take for money to reach that side.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Austin: It depends on the mode of transaction that you opt for, which mode do you intent to use?
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Bank transfer
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: Let me help you with the modes of payment and respective timeframe for a better understanding
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: Mode 1) Direct Transaction Through The Bank

You can transfer payment from your bank account directly to our Organization's account using this banking details. 

*Swift code*:AXISINBB207
*IFSC code*:UTIB0001147
*Account Name*:Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
*Current Account Number* 917020070183626
*Bank's Name*:	Axis Bank Ltd.
*Bank’s Address*:	Janakpuri, B Block, Neww Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058

*But the transaction charges vary from $50 to above because it is an international transaction, you also need a foreign Currency Account and that is why, the second mode is recommended*
17/11/23, 2:46 pm - Austin: Mode 2: Through our associate in Zimbabwe
17/11/23, 2:46 pm - Austin: For the entire $350 the necessary amount including the transfer charges(12.5% of the payable amount)of this mode would be $394 ($350+ $44 transfer charges), and the process would be similar, you would be visiting the bank branch and depositing the fee in his account, the same details are as below:-

*Bank:* FBC
*Account Holder's Name:* Charles Jerera
*Account Number:* 5333 0380 1404 8828
*Swift Code:* FBCPZWHA
*Branch:* Masvingo
*Contact Number:* +263 77 376 9854
17/11/23, 2:46 pm - Austin: *You can also use PayPal or Payment mode on our website(10% transfer charges)  if you have an international credit card or debit card to pay directly to our organization's bank account. This would be a direct mode of transaction*
17/11/23, 2:48 pm - Austin: Mode 1_Direct bank transfer- This mode takes the maximum time to reflect and depends on the bank that you use. It would require 3 days to more

Mode 2- Usually, the amount gets reflected on the second day of the transaction

PayPal or through our Website- The fastest and cheapest mode,reflects same day, within 2-3 hours
17/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 380 0112: I think mode 2 is the most convenient way for us.
17/11/23, 2:57 pm - Austin: That would be fine.
17/11/23, 2:57 pm - Austin: Did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents from your country to learn their experiences through the Edoofa Scholarship program?
17/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 380 0112: Yes , i managed to communicate with Rebecca Tavarwisa .
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 269 3957: And Valerie Rukubo
