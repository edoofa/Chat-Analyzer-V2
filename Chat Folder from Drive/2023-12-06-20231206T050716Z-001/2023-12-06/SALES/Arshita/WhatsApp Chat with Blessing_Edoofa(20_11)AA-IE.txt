The second born in my family is doing O level, third born is in grade 5 and the other two young boys are still at home due to age ,and are all looking forward to their brother.
my father has been financially supporting me for education so far  and will be if by any chance scholarship does not turn out well and he is the Masvingo Province Sales and Marketing Representative for Dendairy. He is in part 2.2 at Great Zimbabwe University where he is doing Honor 's Degree in Business Management.

20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Yes ma'am l Blessings Panashe Chavirima am very confident that l will get the maximum number of points and subjects passed
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: Good to kno w
20/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 087 8756: so far l only did a research on universities in Canada only and the last l applied there was a fee to be paid and due to financial difficulties l could finish the application process
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
20/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

20/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 087 8756: wow😱 that's interesting
20/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
20/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 087 8756: studying in India could positively impact my career  by giving me access to a large pool of talented and motivated co-workers. Indian workers are known for their work ethic and dedication, and they're often highly skilled in areas like software development and data analytics. Studying in India could also help me develop a better understanding of the Indian language and culture, which could be useful in many careers.
20/11/23, 6:27 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
20/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 087 8756: no am not, but l have a n understanding that it is expensive
20/11/23, 6:29 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 6:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:30 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
20/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I think they would be able to afford it
20/11/23, 6:35 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 087 8756: no l don't know
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:37 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Yes ma'am,l would be benefiting a lot because it's not certain that my family would be able to afford the remaining fee which EWYL program is there for me
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

20/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 087 8756: that's absolutely wonderful and EWYL program would be very very helpful as it will allow my father to also on my siblings' education as well
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/11/23, 6:48 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
20/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 087 8756: separation of these points is difficult since l like all the 4 points
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: to be honest l like Persistence Muza 's hardwork
20/11/23, 6:54 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 087 8756: my father Mr Alois Chavirima
20/11/23, 6:55 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 087 8756: They have been waiting for this for a very long time and my family believes education is the key of success so studying abroad would change our lives completely
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
20/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes it is
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 087 8756: sure
20/11/23, 7:02 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/11/23, 7:02 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 087 8756: okay l get it ma'am
20/11/23, 7:04 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 087 8756: wow that's interesting
20/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 087 8756: truly Edoofa is the best
20/11/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Stage 1
20/11/23, 7:09 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am explain
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
20/11/23, 7:10 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
20/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am l am
20/11/23, 7:15 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
20/11/23, 7:15 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

20/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Thank you so much Ms Arshita ma'am
21/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 087 8756: good afternoon
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Austin: Greetings Mr Alois. Mrs Precious and Blessing, 

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Arshita and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes l am sir
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 087 8756: so my question is pertaining to the transport costs like, it has been states that l will be helped to get a visa,does it mean that they would help financially
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Blessing

I hope you are doing well
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Austin: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
(air fare :-around $450,Visa fee:-$83) *is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 087 8756: oooh ok,so let's say l get the scholarship and l have to get to India but currently my family would not be able to afford it but afford it later, would Edoofa help with that?
21/11/23, 3:39 pm - Austin: Do not worry about that challenge Blessing, because you will be able to defer to the next intake and can continue with the Earn While You Learn Program while being in Zimbabwe itself to reduce your costs, gain employability skills and prepare for the intake
21/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 087 8756: ok thanks, that's all I wanted to know
21/11/23, 3:48 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
21/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 087 8756: as for now they would try to get the enrollment fee that's we do not encounter any problems which need financial solution
21/11/23, 4:05 pm - Austin: I understand, have you considered the payment plan for the enrollment fees?
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 087 8756: we did not finish the discussion
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - Austin: Noted, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 087 8756: okay
21/11/23, 4:15 pm - Austin: When are you planning to discuss the same?
21/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 087 8756: if my father comes back early from work we will continue, plus they are waiting to see if am found eligible
21/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 087 8756: so that they know if they going to pay the part fee and the remaining in next 30days
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - Austin: That would be fine, Blessing
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - Austin: Are you having other questions for me?
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 087 8756: no l do not have
21/11/23, 4:27 pm - Austin: So, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 087 8756: 1 Bachelor of Commerce
2 India
3 $6000-$8000
4  
5 $350 ($200 within 7 days and remaining $150 in the next 30 days

6The "Earn While You Learn" program is not only financially beneficial for students, but it also has the potential to transform the way we think about education. By providing students with the opportunity to earn money while they learn, the program could help to close the gap between theory and practice. It could also lead to a more holistic education, where students gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. This could ultimately lead to a more skilled and competitive workforce, and a more innovative and dynamic economy.
Ithe "Earn While You Learn" program is a revolutionary way to make education more accessible and practical. It enables students to gain relevant experience in their chosen field, while also earning money to cover their expenses. This can help students avoid the burden of student debt, and enter the workforce with valuable experience. The program is flexible and allows students to choose the projects that interest them, making it a win-win for both students and businesses. This is truly a program that could change the way we think about education.
21/11/23, 4:44 pm - Austin: You can address the 4th and 7th question
21/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 087 8756: 4 ($350 + $500) 

7 the registration fee isn't an additional amount as it will be waived off from my First year 's Fee thereby making it part of the cost of education itself and the remaining has to be paid after l come in India in 2 installments that's in August 2024 and the other in January 2025
21/11/23, 4:57 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living
21/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ,thank you so much sir
21/11/23, 5:00 pm - Austin: 7) The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1800 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1800-600= $1200
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Oooh now it is very much clearer thanks to you sir
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Austin: You are welcome!
