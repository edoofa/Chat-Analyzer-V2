08/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 860 8572: Wat if you do have O level results
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Kunal: This requirement is for A level results
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 860 8572: Ok ok so A level results first
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, you are eligible for
