Starting from our sessions on the 28th, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on steps needed before January 3rd. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on January 5th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
