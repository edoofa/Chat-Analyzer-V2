27/12/23, 3:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay, Ashleigh.
I have taken a note of this and I completely understand.
But I would recommend you to check if your school offices are going to be open during this duration to acquire these documents as the delay can lead to the delay in your admission process. I hope we are together with this?
