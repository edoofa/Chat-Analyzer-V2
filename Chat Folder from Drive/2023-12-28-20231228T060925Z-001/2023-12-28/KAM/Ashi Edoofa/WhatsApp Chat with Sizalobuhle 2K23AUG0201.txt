27/12/23, 6:20 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Would like to have a recap
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263775620930, Could you please let me know the specific point of which you would like to have a recap?
27/12/23, 6:44 PM - +263 77 562 0930: About the payments mam
27/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Of course, it will be reduced to zero, dear. It is a part of your first year's tuition fee. Allow me to explain further so that you will have a better understanding. The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here? I still have this detailed information.
27/12/23, 6:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263775620930, I would love to assist you here and help you understand the payments please.
27/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes thank you
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once we are done with today's session, we will move ahead with your application with multiple universities. Once they will share an offer letter with us, we will update you and then you will be required to pay the registration amount which is $750 to reserve your scholarship seat however as this is not an additional expense this fees will be reduced from your first year's tuition fees.
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand?
27/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes but isn't said it depends with the university
27/12/23, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263775620930 Kindly elaborate please
27/12/23, 7:11 PM - +263 77 562 0930: It was said admission fee it will depend on the university which accepted your application form so that means the costs are not the same in all universities, if am not mistaken
27/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Please help for more information
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263775620930. The registration fees varies from University to university, although the range for the registration fees is shared with you which is $500 to $750.
27/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam thank you
27/12/23, 7:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263775620930, May I know if you have any other doubt?
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 562 0930: No mam l truly understand
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month.
