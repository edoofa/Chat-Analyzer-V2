1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
