27/12/23, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust this message finds you in good health. As per our last discussion, you mentioned that you were planning to complete the payment after the Christmas Holidays, since the deadline date is just around the corner, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity? 

Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $410 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee? <This message was edited>

27/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 77 535 2647: On the same note , last time she was only allowed to send out a maxmam of $ 250  per transaction.  Therefore I think you can send two invoices one for $250 and the other for the balance
27/12/23, 8:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263775352647, I will share the invoice with you tomorrow so that you can make the payment.
27/12/23, 8:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night!
