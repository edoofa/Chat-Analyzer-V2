I trust this message finds you in good health. Over the past few days, I was expecting a response regarding the update on the remaining amount for your registration fees, however, I did not get an update from your end. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As per our last discussion, you mentioned that you were planning to complete the payment by the end of this month, hence we are due to update the university officials on the same. On the same note, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the current status of your financial preparations.
27/12/23, 11:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Could you please let me know if you were able to raise the balance amount of $250 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?
