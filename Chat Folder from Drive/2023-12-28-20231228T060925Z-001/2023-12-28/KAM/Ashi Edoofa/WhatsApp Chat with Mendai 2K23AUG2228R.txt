27/12/23, 10:16 AM - +260 97 8532307: According the my research, a cardiovascular technologist deals more this computers, assess what the problem is and assist the cardiovascular specialist whom actually carries out the operations.
And for one to be a cardiovascular specialist they are to become a medical doctor first
27/12/23, 10:17 AM - +260 97 8532307: In my case I was put under Bsc in cardiovascular technologist but want to change to cardiovascular specialist is it possible for Edoofa to change?
