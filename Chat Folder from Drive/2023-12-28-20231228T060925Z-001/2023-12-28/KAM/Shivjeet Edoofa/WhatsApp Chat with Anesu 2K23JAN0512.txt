26/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well today.  It has been a while since the last time we were connected, I have also been occupied with the university officials at the same time. Hence I would like to take this opportunity and Inquire about the condition of Anesu as of now. And if she is getting better please let me know if you are comfortable to proceed with the admission process?

I have exhausted my resources but I certainly want he  to be enrolled in the universities of your country (India). I don't know if you can help in any way. He has finished his exams and is waiting for the results
