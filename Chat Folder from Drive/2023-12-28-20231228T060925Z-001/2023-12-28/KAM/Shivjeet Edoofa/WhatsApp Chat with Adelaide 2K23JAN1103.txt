Network zone this side is not guaranteed
19/12/23, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes I am
19/12/23, 9:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow at our scheduled time that is 2:00 PM. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 2:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I am ready
20/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes
20/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I have a question though, you said my results are sent to various universities meaning there is a chance of other universities to send offer letters which i can choose from besides GGI
20/12/23, 2:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
20/12/23, 2:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.
20/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok then we can proceed
20/12/23, 3:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/12/23, 3:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Tuition fee is $1 200 annual
Accomodation is also $1 200
Then the registration fee is $750 which will be reduced to $650 due to endowment plan
20/12/23, 3:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok, so the on campus hostel is what amounts to 1 200 per year
20/12/23, 6:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
20/12/23, 6:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
20/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 2:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session of your offer letter discussion?
25/12/23, 5:56 PM - +91 78278 47624 left
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Adelaide. I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you by the time you were online as it was past my available hours and hence comes the Christmas holiday. In relation to this, I am now active to take on your session. Hence, May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our session for your Offer Letter Discussion?
26/12/23, 3:09 PM - +263 78 057 5394: We can continue sir

Greetings ladies and gentlemen
26/12/23, 3:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
26/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes
26/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
26/12/23, 3:17 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please elaborate
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
26/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Noted it's clear
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I am in Bulawayo sir
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please share with me the alternative modes
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
26/12/23, 3:30 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok noted thanks
26/12/23, 3:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
26/12/23, 3:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please share just in case I'm not sure which one of the methods my father will prefer using , he is not available on WhatsApp these days
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Is it possible for me not to pay yet and wait for offer letters from other institutions??
26/12/23, 6:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
26/12/23, 6:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
26/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Not really clear
27/12/23, 10:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was not able to have a meaningful conversation today as I was occupied with the university official. Hence, I would like to continue our session tomorrow at 1:00 PM. Please let me know if this time is convenient for you. If not you can share your comfortable hours with me within the time frame from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM as well
