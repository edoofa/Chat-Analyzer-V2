19/12/23, 7:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 9:14 PM - +263 77 455 3293: 3.How are the theories aerodynamics used in the aerospace engineering field

Theories of aerodynamics play a cruicial role in the aerospace engineering field.
Engineers use these theories to design  and analyse aircraft , spacecraft and other aerospace vehicles.

These principles of aerodynamics,engineers can optimise the shape ,size and performance of these vehicles.They use such as Bernoulli's principle, Newton laws of motion and the concept of drag to predict and control the behavior of air and fluid flow around the vehicle.
 They also play a crucial role in the aerospace engineering field.They are used to understand and predict the behavior of aircraft and spacecraft in various flight conditions
 
The theories of aerodynamics are designing aircraft,performance , stability and control, wind tunnel testing and computatoral fluid dynamics  

1. Designing aircraft: Aerodynamics theories are used to design the shape and configuration of aircraft wings, fuselage, and other components. The flow of air around these structures, engineers can optimize their design for efficient lift, reduced drag, and improved stability.

2. Performance analysis: Aerodynamics theories help engineers analyze the performance of aircraft and spacecraft. They can predict factors such as lift, drag, thrust, and fuel consumption under different flight conditions. This information is crucial for determining the aircraft's range, speed, and payload capacity.

3.

Stability and control: Aerodynamics theories are used to study the stability and control of aircraft.These  forces and moments act on an aircraft, engineers can design control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and rudders to ensure stable flight and maneuverability.

4. Wind tunnel testing: Aerodynamics theories guide the design and interpretation of wind tunnel tests. Wind tunnels are used to simulate the airflow around an aircraft or spacecraft at different speeds and angles.
The data collected from these tests helps validate and refine the aerodynamic models used in the design process.

5. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD): Aerodynamics theories are implemented in computer simulations known as CFD. These simulations use mathematical equations to model the flow
19/12/23, 9:14 PM - +263 77 455 3293: 4: Lift augmentation
Devices are used in aircraft to enhance the lift generated by the wings .

Flaps 
These are hinged surface on the trailing edge of the wings that can be extended or retracted .By extending the flaps the wings surface area increases creating more lift at lower speeds such as during take off and landing

Slats are movable surfaces located at the leading edge of the wings when extended .

The most common high lift devices are flaps ,stats and Krueger flaps but the category also induces less common installations such as leading edge root extensions which are found on high performance fighter aircraft and boundary layer control devices inclusive of blown flaps .

20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tendai!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Afternoon sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Evening sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Thank you for providing the details with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Sir the payment we were supposed to do isn't it $350 ? If so we have paid in full . We can resend the proof of payment.
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. There was a clerical error on our end. Yes you have paid the full amount, please.
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok sir thank you
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir you can elaborate further
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:53 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok l understand. So how does this plan work <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tendai !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Good evening sir ,yes we can proceed
21/12/23, 6:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 6:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes we agree . And that after  20 months we could have saved $3000
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 8:09 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Yes yes i see but isnt b tech aerospace a four year course . Using information we received earlier when we got the explanation of the course
21/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 71 338 7901: We were of the opinion that tendai starts her EWYL in November 2025 after she sits for her final exams . Shes in a school where use of phones is prohibited and the EWYL will not be conducted smoothly because of this . But after shes done she will have access ro a phone .
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 71 338 7901: However during holidays which are a month long she will have access to a phone . I dont know if the EWYL can be done during her holidays which are at most 30 days .
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, please excuse me for the error here.
21/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Okay
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: About the EWYL process that is completely possible and we shall have a detailed explanation about the same once we have shared you with the details. May I know if you are clear with me now?
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 71 338 7901: Thank you sir . Same to you .
27/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Tendai. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Good evening we are ready
27/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir understood
27/12/23, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 455 3293: We  will be done by tomorrow morning so next session can be done tomorrow anytime
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you sir
