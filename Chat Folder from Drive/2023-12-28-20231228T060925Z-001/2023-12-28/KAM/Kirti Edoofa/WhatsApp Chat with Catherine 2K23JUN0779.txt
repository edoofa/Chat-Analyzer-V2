I trust you are all doing well and had a productive weekend. Following up on our previous conversation, I'm reaching out to see if you are currently available to engage with us. This would allow us to proceed with our discussion as planned. <This message was edited>

18/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your situation with me. I can understand that network challenges, especially during the festive season, can pose communication difficulties, particularly if you are visiting family in areas with limited connectivity. Additionally, I want to address the concern you raised regarding the deadline, @263773031875 If a student misses the university's specified due date, they may lose the opportunity, making it crucial to adhere to the deadline.
