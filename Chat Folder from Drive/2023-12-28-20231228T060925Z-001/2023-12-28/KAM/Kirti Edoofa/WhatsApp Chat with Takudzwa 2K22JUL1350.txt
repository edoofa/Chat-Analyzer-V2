I trust this message finds you well.

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been expecting a response from your end so that we can complete the remaining university admission formalities. I am sure you are aware that we have been working towards Takudzwa's application since July 2022 and now that you have your offer letter and you were able to complete half of the registration formalities you are now to complete the remaining registration formalities. We tried to reach out for an update, especially since our last conversation where you planned to make the fee payment through Mama Money and requested an order for it. However, we haven't heard from you since then. <This message was edited>
