I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the holiday season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?

I hope this message finds you in good health. I'm getting in touch to ask about the specific date you intend to pay the final portion of the registration fee. The university officials have requested this information, and I need to provide them with an update. Could you kindly share your planned payment date with me? This information would be very helpful.
