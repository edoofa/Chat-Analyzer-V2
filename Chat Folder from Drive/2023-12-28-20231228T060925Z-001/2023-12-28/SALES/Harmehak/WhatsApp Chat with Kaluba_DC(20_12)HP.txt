*I am Ms.Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

I am here to evaluate Kaluba Kaluba's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
20/12/23, 9:51 am - +260 774124400: Yes
20/12/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 9:53 am - +260 774124400: Thank you
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..


Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 9:17 am - +260 774124400: Alright thank you
21/12/23, 9:18 am - +260 774124400: What are the requirements for one to obtain a 100% scholarship?
21/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Kaluba?
21/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 774124400: This is a fully funded scholarship
21/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 774124400: Apologies, let me rephrase my question
21/12/23, 9:39 am - +260 774124400: How are scholarships allocated?
21/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
21/12/23, 10:18 am - +260 774124400: Thank you for the clarification
21/12/23, 10:23 am - +260 774124400: When a person is accepted to study in India, who covers the cost for accommodation, food, and transport? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 10:25 am - +260 774124400: Does the ewyl program cover these needs?
21/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Before I address the same, Kaluba. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Did you understand that Edoofa offers scholarships?
21/12/23, 11:06 am - +260 774124400: Yes
21/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: So are you clear that Edoofa helps with 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee, Kaluba?
21/12/23, 11:27 am - +260 774124400: Yes
21/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.

26/12/23, 12:09 pm - +260 774124400: Wow this is so inspiring
26/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Kaluba

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
26/12/23, 12:29 pm - +260 774124400: Not entirely
26/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
26/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:33 pm - +260 774124400: For the entire course?
26/12/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Kaluba, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 80- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Kaluba?
26/12/23, 1:19 pm - +260 774124400: I believe that this is really going to help me a lot. And I would like to apply for your ewyl program
26/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
26/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
26/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

26/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 774124400: Thank you
26/12/23, 1:56 pm - +260 774124400: Is it possible for me attend any upcoming webinar?
26/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: You get to participate in all of them as well please.

You would begin with your Earn While You Learn Program while you are still in Zambia.
26/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 774124400: Okay, when is the next webinar likely to be held?
26/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 774124400: Does it also mean that I'll be given tasks to complete?
26/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Once you are a part of the program, your mentor will inform you regarding the same.
26/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
26/12/23, 2:30 pm - +260 774124400: Okay thank you 😊
26/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
26/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 774124400: Wow Okay
26/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 774124400: Are deadlines given to when the tasks must be completed?
26/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Your assigned projects and your EWYL mentor would guide you throughout the same and make a thorough schedule for you as well
26/12/23, 2:37 pm - +260 774124400: Okay
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 774124400: If I were to choose to study here in Zambia ,would I be still able to apply with edoofa? As in would I be taken the same way as someone who's studying for the first time?
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Kaluba, from the same are you clear that Edoofa is only for those who wish to study in India?
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 774124400: What about those applying for masters or PhD?
26/12/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: That is also in India only
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - +260 774124400: Okay
26/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Now Kaluba, do you believe you would get such a great Opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program in Zambia  along with the quality education?
26/12/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Kaluba.
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 3:33 pm - +260 774124400: I will 🙏
26/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Do you understand the difference between the quality of education in India and in Zambia, Kaluba?
26/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 774124400: Not really but I think I have an idea
26/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
26/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Kaluba, I would like to have a proper understanding if you wish to study in India, Kaluba?
26/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 774124400: I do wish to study in India
26/12/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
26/12/23, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Kaluba?
26/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 774124400: Yes apologies for the late reply
26/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand
26/12/23, 4:35 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Kaluba, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
26/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 4:38 pm - +260 774124400: It would cost more but increases the chances of admission
26/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: How much would it cost considering $300x5 and $450x5?
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - +260 774124400: $1500-$2250
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
26/12/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - +260 774124400: Yes very much
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/12/23, 4:51 pm - +260 774124400: When are reservation letters likely to be sent out to eligible students ?
26/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: After the interview please.
26/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
26/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
26/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 4:53 pm - +260 774124400: When is the interview please?
26/12/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Going through the Edoofa cycle would help you have a better clarity.
26/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 774124400: Yes
26/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 774124400: Oh I now understand thank you
26/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
26/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

26/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Penmal Connect.vcf (file attached)
26/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Are you connected with Ms Betty at the Penmal Connect, Kaluba?
26/12/23, 5:34 pm - +260 774124400: Yes but she has not yet responded
26/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: She will get back,

Do connect your parents with Ms Betty as well.
26/12/23, 5:49 pm - +260 774124400: Should I create a group  with her and my parents?
26/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: They can have a direct call itself.
26/12/23, 5:52 pm - +260 774124400: Oh okay
26/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
26/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. Tomorrow, on *27-12-23* at 10:30 P.M. CAT, *Mr. Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*, will meticulously evaluate your application.

Prepare for a series of interviews with *Mr. Sahil and the Director*, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as Mr. Sahil's time is valuable.
