What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
~ You can get a 100% scholarship with Edoofa program but it does not cover all costs from transport to flight. There's an earn as you learn program that helps you get funds to pay for your fees and credits. This sponsorship program is based in India. For help I can contact Miss Jasmine or Miss Saloni

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I am a young,ambitious and full of potential.  My passion is deeply grounded within the engineering sector and in the need to make the world a better place through engineering solutions that make life easier. My parents can't fund for my education, because they earn very little.

23/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 419 0078: Let me say it was really an eye opener. I got to learn that it is possible to  earn credits to cater for my education whilst I am learning. On my side that'll be killing two birds with one stone. 

I also learnt that India is such a welcoming country, filled with warm hearted people, nurtured by different cultures.I also loved that there are Mentors who are always motivating Edoofa students to follow a good path, to work hard and also to continuously mould their characters for the better
23/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to see you were intrigued by the shared video and you got to learn more about the program and students.
23/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

23/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
23/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 419 0078: I have  some questions please✋🏽

What are requirements for one to find a seat in the Edoofa program? 
And what is the selection process like?
I would also love to know  the cut off points for specific programs . If you  can share with me some templates for certain universities with their offers please.
23/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Duly received please.
23/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Yes I am confident Ma'am.
23/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great
23/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
23/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Following..thank you
23/12/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Since we celebrate Christmas on Monday, *Hence, We will now connect on Tuesday at 9:30 AM CAT*. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

Yes we can start please
26/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Cecilia, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Innocent better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
26/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?
26/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Hello Ma'am

The both of us are partly educated. I , Cecilia Chiroro never sat for Ordinary level . My highest level of education is form 3 , which is the 10th grade. Mr Kandoro's highest level of education is 11th grade . 

What pushes us to support Tendai  is the potential we have seen in him since he was a child. He has always been hard working, ambitious, he's very innovative. I believe that the success we never attained as parents can still be attained through our own fruit. We look up to him as our first born child. We wish the best for him
26/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Cecilia, Its a pleasure to know about you and Mr Kandoro!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

What is your and Mr Kandoro's current profession please?
26/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Mr Kandoro works as a security guard. I am a vendor .
26/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

26/12/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

It's a pleasure to know about them, Mrs Cecilia.
26/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 419 0078: 🙏
26/12/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know more about Tendai as a student,

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies along with his O and A level results please?
26/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Tendai is anxious and loves learning new things.  He is very intelligent. He loves music very much,  that is his dearest hobby. He is in the church choir( The Catholic Church). He even composes his own songs.
 
For Ordinary level he learnt at a C school Mkoba Number 3 High and he passed with flying colours . He had 10 As and a B out of 11 subjects. 

For A level we decided to get him enrolled at an A school, Fletcher High School. He did Pure Mathematics , Physics and Chemistry and he passed. He had 2 Cs in Chemistry and Physics and an E in Pure Math

Surely seems to be a great student.

Can you please share his results in a picture format?
26/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 419 0078: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: Remarkable.

Do share A level results as well.
26/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 419 0078: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Received and noted.
26/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 419 0078: 🙏
26/12/23, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Cecilia, since Tendai appeared A level last year, 

May I know why didn't he pursue higher education after A level?
26/12/23, 6:19 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Well, since we earn little. Tendai suggested that he takes a gape year so that we get time to gather and save money for his tertiary education. He got a job in June and has been working at a cresh named Rutendo Heart for Children Nursey Centre till now
26/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I do understand.
26/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Cecilia, are you aware that Edoofa is proudly associated with Fletcher high school as we have students from the school currently in India too?
26/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 419 0078: I was not aware
26/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Is it exciting to know the same now?
26/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Yes it really is.
26/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 419 0078: I would like to clarify something about my family if you can allow me Mrs Harmehak
26/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 419 0078: I was initially married to Mr Innocent Kandoro and  we  had Tendai and Tinevimbo. Our relationship did not work out so we divorced.  I then remarried Mr Trust Dube and we had Thembelani and Tanyaradzwa . We live together. Mr Dube is a peasant miner, (he does gold panning) so our income is never certain. There are good times and some really tough times when we can have a long dry season. We were able to send him to a Secondary school with difficulties and he got a scholarship for advanced level that got him enrolled at Fletcher high school . He was under the Delta Bursary but as a day scholarship. We have been in a dry season for quit some time  and his biological father can't support him since he also has another family to take care of and he is empolyed as a security guard which means he earns enough to support his family. Well I just thought it was neccessarry that you know our actual family set up
26/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Tendai couldn't carry on under Delta Bursary because their condition was that he attains 15 points which means straight A passes for A levl
26/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Mr Dube 's highest level of education is grade 7. The problem was that we misinterpreted the first Form that we filled and thought we needed to enter biological father's details. His guardian father is Mr Dube and he has been supporting his son ever since with all he  has
26/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
26/12/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your honesty please.
26/12/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted and I understand.

It's a pleasure to know more about Mr Dube.
26/12/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Thank you for understanding🙏
26/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
26/12/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Cecilia, I would like to have a better understanding regarding the financial support for Tendai's higher education!

Can you please address the same?
26/12/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 419 0078: Honestly tertiary education is expensive for our income. Tendai has siblings who are also growing up , to mention his younger sister Tinevimbo just finished ordinary level . We have been serving but we are really behind time . Tendai wants to liberate himself financially and he was suggesting that if our first plan of serving does not work out he will look for a job and send himself to university while working so that we do not disadvantage his siblings. On the other hand we were also hoping for a scholarship opportunity but we were not really counting on this one since its not obvious, it is uncertain and with very low chances
26/12/23, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
26/12/23, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: However, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
26/12/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
26/12/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared document as well.
26/12/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Thank you for explaining. 

Therefore in this case we're applying for a scholarship, right? Meaning we cater for accommodation and feeding
26/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers scholarship itself please.
27/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Good morning, I'm alright thanks and you?
27/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Yes we can start please
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well please
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to follow my discussion with your mother please?
27/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 156 1612: Yes I did
27/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So far do you have any queries for me?
27/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 419 0078: I've switched to this number.  

No I do not have any queries.
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the document?
27/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 419 0078: I went through it but I have not finished yet
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
27/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 419 0078: 1I have understood that Edoofa is a social, for profit organization that aims at helping the most deserving students across the globe with affordable higher education, life changing   internship opportunities.Edoofa also makes sure that students are skilled and employable through structured and practical training and internship programs.Students also get to earn scholarship credits right from their first year by engaging in online part-time projects and tasks along with their degree program. This helps the students lower their educational fees and more over , it increases their experience with working online. There are limited seats and therefore the program carefully select the most deserving students .

2 I have undestood that;


 The more success stories Edoofa makes with its program, the more credibility it gains and the community grows  and the more value Edoofa parent company adds to the partner schools, colleges and universities. This gives Edoofa more relationships and partnerships and thus helping it to grow its  financial muscles.
