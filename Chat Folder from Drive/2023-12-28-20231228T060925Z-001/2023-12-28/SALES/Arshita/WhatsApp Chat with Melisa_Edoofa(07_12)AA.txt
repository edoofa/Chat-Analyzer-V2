07/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 251 5201: I'm glad you're  familiar  with my province
07/12/23, 1:07 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You expressed yourself genuinely. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of medicine?
07/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 251 5201: I studied biology since form one till now and my performance is quite good
07/12/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.

Pictures will be better
07/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 251 5201: Olk let me look for my portal
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: May I know when will you be sharing?
07/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 251 5201: Maybe at 5 when l receive the portal

Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level?

07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Arshita: Noted
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 251 5201: I'm very confident  l'll definitely achieve  it
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 251 5201: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 251 5201: I haven't  applied to any university  as of yet but definitely  I'm looking  forward to it
07/12/23, 1:51 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
07/12/23, 1:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:51 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done

There are a lot of applications in the waiting list from different schools of Zimbabwe. Thus I want you to be very active in these sessions so that you don't miss it. 

Let me know if there is any challenge.
07/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 251 5201: I'm done reading
07/12/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

07/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 251 5201: What if one has biology and geography with no Chem
07/12/23, 2:39 pm - Arshita: For medical field Biology, chemistry and physics is the perfect requirement

07/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 251 5201: Can you please explain more on these fields
07/12/23, 2:40 pm - Arshita: May I know which course shall I Explain? <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 251 5201: Physiotherapy

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
07/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 251 5201: As of yet l haven't  got much information  on Indian educational  facilities but l'd like to say that I'm looking forward to injecting more knowledge based on Indian universities
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

08/12/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 251 5201: Iam not familiar
08/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
08/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 251 5201: They can afford
08/12/23, 2:26 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
08/12/23, 4:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 10:45 am - Arshita: Greetings! 
Hope you are doing well!
