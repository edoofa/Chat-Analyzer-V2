22/12/23, 9:56 am - Tushti: Noted
22/12/23, 9:56 am - Tushti: I would now like for the mother or sister to come online and help me understand how the family has planned to manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad
22/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 218 9182: Hi there it's a bit complicated because initially we were of the idea that the scholarship will cater for costs because honestly it's me alone n am a struggling teacher who has a load on her shoulders. We will have to work extra hard
22/12/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: @263712189182 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 218 9182: I now understand then we will have to weigh the costs and make a way forward
22/12/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: Will the family be able to raise around $2000 for the annual fee after scholarship?
22/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 218 9182: Annual it's reasonable
22/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 218 9182: Can it be paid in installments
22/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: Yes, it can be made in two installments
22/12/23, 10:09 am - Tushti: I would now like to have the O LEVEL and L5 result pictures for evaluation
22/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 218 9182: Unfortunately in the mean time those results are not available. She is visiting me in Gwanda but stays in Bulawayo. Theycan only be available in January
22/12/23, 10:21 am - Tushti: I see

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:
*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.
*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.
*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.
*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.
*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.
*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.
*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.
*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
22/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Ok
22/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 262 2090: I will go with social works
22/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
22/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 262 2090: As a social work professional, I see myself making a positive impact on the lives of individuals and communities in need. I want to use my knowledge and skills to help people overcome challenges and improve their quality of life. Edoofa's Program would enable me to achieve my dreams by providing me with the resources, support, and connections I need to succeed. I believe that with the right opportunities and guidance, I can make a meaningful difference in the world.
22/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: That is really great Tracy, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

22/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Thank you for your insight.

22/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 262 2090: I believe in broadening my horizons not necessarily undermining my country. Also, want to experience life outside my own country
22/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: I see
22/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
22/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 262 2090: I heard that it has the following:Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing- The Indian Education system is vast in size, as well as its academic offerings. A vibrant and diverse education system means a wide variety of courses are available - from the modern and cutting edge to the traditional. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education Systemwith more than 800 universities, 39,000 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education.

22/12/23, 2:38 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
22/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 218 9182: It's a struggle but we have to make regardless of the status quo hence the scholarship comes at an opportune time. If l succeed l will be the first in the family.
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: In simple words Tracywhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/12/23, 3:56 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Edoofa's Earn While You Learn program is an amazing opportunity for students to offset their education costs. The program provides students with flexible, paid work opportunities that allow them to gain valuable experience while earning money to help cover their expenses. This is a unique and valuable resource for students who want to reduce the financial burden of their education.
22/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Wow this is a great opportunity
22/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Ok thank you Mrs Tushti
22/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 218 9182: This message was deleted
23/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 262 2090: Good morning ..yes we may continue
23/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
23/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/12/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
23/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 262 2090: Wow this is very impressive
23/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 262 2090: Yes ...so The EWYL program helps to lessen the burden again from your family...I have a question does one qualify for it when they are doing their higher education or before
23/12/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: You may start earning as soon as you enroll with Edoofa
23/12/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
23/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 262 2090: Wow, that's really interesting! I had no idea that there was a program like the EWYL Program that allows students to earn scholarship credits while gaining real-world work experience. It sounds like a great way to help students prepare for their future careers while making their education more affordable. How does the program determine how many scholarship credits a student earns based on their performance?

I'm curious to learn more about the 21st-century job skills that are taught in the program. It's great that students are being prepared for the modern workforce. What kinds of projects do students work on
23/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 262 2090: Yes I'm ready but my parents are currently offline
23/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 262 2090: Ok
23/12/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: Please ask them to join us
23/12/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: Tracy, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/12/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Do calculate the answer, Tracy
23/12/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
23/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Tracy, may I know what's going on?
23/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 218 9182: Tentatively a student might need to use between the ranges $1500-$2250 respectively
23/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/12/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: Do answer
23/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 218 9182: Yes it is
23/12/23, 5:19 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 262 2090: Thank wish you happy festive season... will go through the links
26/12/23, 9:34 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
26/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 262 2090: Yes we may
26/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Tracy, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 10:23 am - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
26/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 262 2090: No
26/12/23, 10:28 am - Tushti: Do let me know what question you have?
26/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 262 2090: $350 is for the reservations ... what happens when you do EWYL program and are not competent for the scholarship
26/12/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: If your application gets rejected from all Universities, the mobey would be refunded to you
26/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 262 2090: Oh ok
26/12/23, 10:45 am - Tushti: Does your parent have any questions?
26/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 262 2090: Non of them are online
26/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Noted
26/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Shall I continue?
26/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 262 2090: Yes but I'm worried my parents can't make $350 in 7 days
26/12/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: In that case, how would they raise $3000 per year?
26/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 262 2090: Mom said she would but I don't want her drowning in debts because of me. I'm very grateful for the opportunity, but I've decided to decline the offer. I'm sorry Mrs Tushti for any inconvenience this may cause.
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: So, the family wishes to withdraw this application?
26/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 262 2090: Yes Ma'am and I'm sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
27/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 262 2090: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Whats going on Tracy?
