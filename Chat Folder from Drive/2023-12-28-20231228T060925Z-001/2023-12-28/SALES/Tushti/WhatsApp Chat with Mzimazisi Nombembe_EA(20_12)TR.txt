26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: Noted with thanks
26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
26/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes its quite challenging for them
26/12/23, 5:33 pm - Tushti: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you  again at *09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
26/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Noted with thanks, God bless you too
27/12/23, 9:23 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Good morning
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we can start
27/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning Ms Tushti
27/12/23, 10:26 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: We have a  poultry project that supplements the  salary.
27/12/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: Would the family be able to raise around $2000 per year for the tuition fee?
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 634 2169: Even though they are struggling to raise our school fees, one or the other they would manage to get through. They kero some chickens and sell to supplement their earnings. With the fees needed for higher education , well it depends with the amounts rquired
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 693 3511: Truly speaking anything above $1200 will unaffordable looking at the current situation.
27/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 693 3511: If we put aside $100 aside every month it's much affordable.
27/12/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: Well, is there anyone in the family who can provide financial assistance for the remaining part of the fee?
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: I wish there was.  If our elder children were employed definitely we would manage to pour in together to raise the whole amount.  But currently we don't have anyone reliable to assist
27/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: In that case, do you wish to withdraw this application?
27/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 693 3511: No. We don't wish to withdraw Mam. Attaining a scholarship for our son due to financial constraints had always been our wish.
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 693 3511: I'm kindly asking if you could adjust the required top_up amount if possible.
27/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 693 3511: ...to a figure that is lower than 2000usd.
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Tushti: WE do have the EWYLProgram that helps the student self sponsor their education
27/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Okay Mam. How does this one work?
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh I have just checked on the EWYLProgram. If it's possible for our son to work and raise the remaining $800  while he learns we would really appreciate
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I would love to learn and work to reduce a burden from my parents
27/12/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: However, if the student is unable to earn the amount, the family would have to pay
27/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Its alright. In that case we will have to go beyond our means. What we don't want is our son to lose this opportunity
27/12/23, 5:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Noted with thanks
27/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Noted, good night.
