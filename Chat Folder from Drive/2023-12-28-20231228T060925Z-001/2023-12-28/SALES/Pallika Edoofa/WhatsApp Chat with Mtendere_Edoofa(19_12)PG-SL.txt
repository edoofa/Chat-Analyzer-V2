20/12/23, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Kachere, As you mentioned that it is your child's desire to work in the Medical Field, but, unfortunately, we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible for Nursing. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy
2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology
3) Bachelor of Pharmacy
4) Bachelor of Optometry
5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
20/12/23, 12:13 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Yes, explain more on medical Lab technology
20/12/23, 12:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Mrs. Kachere

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
20/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope this course might alings with what you are aiming for Mtendere.
20/12/23, 12:32 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Do you also have public health
20/12/23, 12:33 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Bachelor's degree in Public health
20/12/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mtendere, We do offer BSc health care and clinal research  but the courses offered above have higher scope and opportunities in front of your after graduation, Therefore it is more advised and recommended for your career

20/12/23, 1:06 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Will go for Lab technology
20/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
20/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
20/12/23, 1:12 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Am sure that my achievement will also provide for the nation achievement through a better and healthy living
20/12/23, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mtendere, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Will try to be more focused and work hard through the Grace of the Lord.
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Kachere, So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
20/12/23, 1:26 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: No
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Mrs. Kachere, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.






*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to you and your family?* <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 1:32 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: I would first find out how much it is with our Malawi Kwacha
20/12/23, 1:50 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Mmmm but I can't afford sir
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Thought it's fully funded scholarship
20/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Kachere, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
20/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand!!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/12/23, 1:54 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Tell us
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you and Mtendere will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?* <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:12 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Will try to do the same
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/12/23, 2:25 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Ok
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mrs. Kachere, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: All of them are fine.
But 4 eases the situation
20/12/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

20/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work However may I know, you will be helping Mtendere with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: If need arises
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/12/23, 3:14 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: It  is a joyful feel
20/12/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Kachere, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
20/12/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: So it is
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
20/12/23, 3:21 pm - +265 999 27 39 45: Do so

How are you doing today?
26/12/23, 4:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mtendere, I've noticed that you haven't been actively participating in our chats, and it's important to emphasize that active engagement is a crucial aspect of this program. Your current level of participation is not in line with our requirements. I will monitor your application for two more days, and if there is no improvement in your activity during that time, we may have to consider revoking it.

27/12/23, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mtendere, May I know that have you considered the payment plan?
27/12/23, 4:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Mtendere, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Thursday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
