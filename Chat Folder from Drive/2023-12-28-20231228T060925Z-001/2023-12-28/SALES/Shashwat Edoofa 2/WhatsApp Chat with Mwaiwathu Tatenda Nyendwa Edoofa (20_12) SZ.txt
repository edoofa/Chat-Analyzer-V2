20/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 977 5216: My Ordinary level standing is
2A’s 5B’s 3C’s
I could send the certificate if you like..
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I wrote my Advanced level this year and my results come out on the 10th of January..
I was doing *Mathematics Chemistry & Biology*
And had hopes of starting *Physics* this year and writing it in June..

But due to financially crippling situation I was only able to write *2 subjects, Math & Chem*
That it to say, I am awaiting results for those those 2 subjects
20/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I completed my Alevels at Smit Academy..
I want help people on the largest scale possible..
I’m interested in learning about other religions & reading books
My mothers highest qualification is Ordinary level.. she had a very successful business but went bankrupt more than half a decade ago.. now she lives and works odd-jobs in South Africa..
I’m the youngest of 3, and the only one inmy family to Advance to A level..
20/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 977 5216: That should be all..
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tatenda. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. Your aspirations to help people on a large scale and your genuine interest in learning about other religions and reading books are truly commendable.

The curiosity and openness you demonstrate in exploring diverse religious perspectives through reading underscore your intellectual curiosity and respect for different belief systems! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed illumination on "Financially Crippling Situation", please?
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Thank you very much..
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Currently, I mostly live with relatives but my mother has a house in Harare. Just before the time the exam fee was announced my mother didn’t have the money and she made a decision that wasn’t easy to sell the house, she figured the money would go a long way besides my exam fee. She received the downpayment for the house and within the same week, as if fate were against it, she got robbed of all the money and injured to a very saddening state..

A few weeks later the exam fee was announced, we couldn make the due date. The people who had bought the house started giving excuses and we eventually lost hope in them. The only reason i was able to register was because of the late registration extension and we were barely able to afford to register those 2 subjects..
20/12/23, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about the challenging circumstances you and your family are facing, Tatenda. Facing such adversities requires great strength, and I commend you and your family for navigating through these challenges. I sincerely hope that despite the setbacks, you find the resilience to overcome these difficulties.

20/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
20/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 977 5216: My mother will, the situation is more or less stabled..
And from what I understand, the Edoofa programs assists candidates with finding part time jobs to pay off the rest of their financial needs.. or is that no longer the case?..
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that we offer a distinctive program that allows students to engage in internships and self-finance a significant part of their fees while completing their coursework. I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Smit Academy* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education? <This message was edited>

27/12/23, 9:46 am - +27 84 881 9934: Tatenda is offline I think there's a problem of network that side. I hope he will be come as soon as possible
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Rosemary! May I know whether you are available for the session right now, please?
27/12/23, 10:19 am - +27 84 881 9934: I am
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding Tatenda's career aspirations more vividly, please?
27/12/23, 10:22 am - +27 84 881 9934: Tatenda told me that he want to study medicine
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Rosemary, could you please share why Tatenda didn't pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +27 84 881 9934: I think it's because it's a science subject since he want to become a medical doctor in future
27/12/23, 10:37 am - +27 84 881 9934: It's a critical subject but Tatenda is a hard worker according to study
27/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/12/23, 11:29 am - +27 84 881 9934: He was studying physics, chemistry, biology and maths. But due to financial problems he wrote only 2 subjects
27/12/23, 11:29 am - +27 84 881 9934: And I hope he will write on June
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Rosemary. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Tatenda's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Go ahead please
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Number 7
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have some prior knowledge regarding the program, please?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I don't have any knowledge I think I just like it
27/12/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Physiotherapy
*Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

27/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I do however have a question..

I previously heard that 8pts would be the minimum for a 50% scholarship for someone who wrote 3 subjects..
Given my situation having written only 2 subjects.. isit allthe same or does it work logically as half of fifteen is 8 and half of 10 is 5..
So 5pts is a 50% scholarship ooor???..
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
27/12/23, 4:45 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I hope so
