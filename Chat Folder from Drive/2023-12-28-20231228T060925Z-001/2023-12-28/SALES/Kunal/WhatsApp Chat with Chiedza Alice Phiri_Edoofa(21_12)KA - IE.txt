I had totally given up on my studies but then kelvin told me that edoofa is where I can actually start from til I reach the point I really want
23/12/23, 10:51 am - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
23/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 779 8387: Well last year that's when I did a little research on the education in India. According to my sources, India is on number 5 when it comes to tertiary pass rates. Half of the millionaires attended their studies in India. It creates a vacuum whereby everyone can pursue their dreams without any restrictions. Unlike in some universities that I know, India emphasizes on talent recognition,..what I'm just trying to say is that it makes one know their strength and weaknesses. In India , dreams become true

27/12/23, 9:48 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

Shall we proceed with the session?
27/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 779 8387: Morning
27/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 779 8387: Yea
27/12/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
27/12/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: Please address this
27/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 779 8387: Well I think by studying in India I'll be  exposed to many opportunities. In other countries, law is nolonger being recognized...so according to my research, a certificate from Indian education proves attracts many law firms in India. My dream is to come home with a degree and then work full time in India
27/12/23, 11:18 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 779 8387: No sir
27/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
27/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 779 8387: Ok I understand
27/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 779 8387: Ok ok
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/12/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 779 8387: Ok
27/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 779 8387: Yes I'll be benefiting a lot sir . Work experiences and I'll be able to fend for myself
27/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 779 8387: I'll also be helping my parents too
27/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
27/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 779 8387: I'm really loving this idea sir ......it's just splendid
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 779 8387: I like the idea number4
27/12/23, 11:36 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

27/12/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 779 8387: My dad and my brother
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 779 8387: They are scared of course but they also respect my decision. This is what I think is best for us all
27/12/23, 11:52 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
27/12/23, 11:52 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
27/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 779 8387: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: I would suggest you to type your response ahead
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 779 8387: Ok sir
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 779 8387: Ok fine .....so you mean I have to pay 350 just for the application? What if I don't get enrolled, will I be given back the money or not? I do not want a situation whereby I'll be blamed for wasting money by my parents. Here in Zimbabwe it's really hard to get that money in a short time ....both my brother and my dad are given their monthly salaries at the end of the month so that means inorder for us to have the money within a short space of time , they'll both have to be involved in some debts.
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 779 8387: I hope you understand what I'm trying to say sir
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Kunal: I completely understand
Let me tell you that you only have to pay the enrollment fee if you found eligible for the program and receives an acceptance letter from our board
Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
27/12/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 779 8387: Ok sir ..I understand
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 779 8387: Yeah sure it really makes sense
27/12/23, 12:13 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 779 8387: I think we are now on stage 2.
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 779 8387: I believe all that we have been doing was counselling and guidance session
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 779 8387: Yes sir go on
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
27/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 779 8387: Yeah it's very clear sir.
27/12/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
27/12/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
