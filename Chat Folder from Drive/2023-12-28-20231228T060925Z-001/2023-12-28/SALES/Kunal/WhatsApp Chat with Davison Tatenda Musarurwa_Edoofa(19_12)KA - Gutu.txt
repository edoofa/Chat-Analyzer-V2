I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 481 7854: Yes iam
26/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

May I know with his interests towards Medical field, why didn't he opt for science subjects?
26/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 481 7854: He didn't get A or B in some subjects
26/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kunal: Alright, let me tell you that since he is not having science subjects at A level, he is not eligible for the Medical field
At the same time, may I know he is having any alternate career aspirations?
26/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

As we've thoroughly covered the course details, and since you are aware Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
27/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 481 7854: Their System believe that university education should be affordable, accessible and should lead to employment
27/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 481 7854: No
27/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 481 7854: Will respond to this tomorrow after I have talked to Davison s father he is not with me at the moment
27/12/23, 1:26 pm - Kunal: That is fine
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
27/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!
