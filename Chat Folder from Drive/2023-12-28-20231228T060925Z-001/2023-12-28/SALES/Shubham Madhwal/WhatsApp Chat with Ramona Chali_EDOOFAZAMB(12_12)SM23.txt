     Iam a person whose optimistic,goal oriented and persistent at any interest of my work.I  do play football not taken as a career but a way of exercising my mental and physical body.looking at how people in the society live,many have conditions or heart related issues which hinders one to do or achieve work effectively.I was compelled to the matter and thought of persuing a course under Technology which happens to be cardiovascular Technology.
     Secondly, My highest level of education is O level/grade 12 ,I completed in 2018 at kafushi secondary school graduating with good results as a consequence of quality education offered there.
     Therefore,The course of study as stated in introduction I would like to persue is cardiovascular Technology,This course will not only help me as an individual but the globe at large, contributing to the industry under Technology through gathered information and research.
     However,my parents and myself are business oriented people.We have a poultry on which we depend on for our survival and I do sell electronic gadgets and apparel for my upkeep.
      Neverless,my father's current level edubcation is A level.He persued a course in Adult Education graduating with a degree but still not employed.                      My Mother's level of education is currently O level.
      My father and Mother have been sponsoring me since childhood untill date.They have supported me with everything they had untill my graduation to grade 12
   However,Out of 100% I rate only 20% can my parents afford concerning finances .At the look of our situation at home my parents cannot meet the requirements needed to cover up my finances.
      Further more, come from a family of 6 of which children we're 4 and I Am  the second born.two of my siblings are still doing there O level education and My elder brother just graduated from school with a diploma in clinical officing.
    Lastly I am currently not in any academic activities due to insufficient funds,that's more of a reason why I applied for Edoofa scholarship program.

18/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 1819712: Kafushi secondary school is Located in central province of Zambia,in a town called kabwe.This boarding school stands on a motto which says,"decipline and hardwork lead to success" and that's so true to the fact that the school priortises every students to work hard to there ability.During my academic nurture,
I have witnessed the school producing Elite students graduating with flying colors and earning schorlaships at the end of there study.
      Nevertheless,the school has/had desciplined and dedicated teachers, working on extra hours in order to make the best out of students.
  Kafushi boarding, despite being in a rural area it provides the condusive studying environment and the Library for research work.
    

Kafushi secondary being a boarding school kept me bound on my academic work, with the provision of sufficient lessons and studying time did I find myself an opportunity to do my very best.
Kafushi secondary board encourages students to form study groups,of which I indulged  myself into.It has been understood that forming study groups contributes to the growth of one struggling with academic work.

The school activities that I indulged myself into where, the maths club,footall and singing in choir.

20/12/23, 12:53 pm - +260 97 1819712: Thank you for the helpful information Sir.I'm so impressed and motivated about India's achievements through out it's course of history,it shows that the country all along had the vision of spreading academics and skill building across the country and globe at large.Hence It brings clarity to my mind why India is recommended as a higher education destination.
I'm inspired once more.
20/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 1819712: The reason I want to study Abroad and not in my country is because Abroad there is a provision of profound quality education,high odds of job employment and a privilege of experiencing a whole new culture.
Studying abroad will    offere me an opportunity to experience practical skills.
Studying abroad will help in taking care of financial issues depending on extracurricular And academic records.
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 1819712: No Sir,I've never applied to a university abroad nor did I make research about foreign education.

20/12/23, 4:52 pm - +260 97 1819712: I'm not well aware Sir.
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food

20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - +260 97 1819712: I don't have any question Sir.may we proceed please.
20/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn WHile Yoou learn Program?
20/12/23, 5:28 pm - +260 97 1819712: Yes please !!
20/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/12/23, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

20/12/23, 5:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/12/23, 6:26 pm - +260 97 1819712: The EWYL program seems to be a Helpful platform,
At the look of it I think it's not only helping students  achieve there dreams but also providing other alternatives to grow there Career .I believe this provision coming from EWYL program  is overrated and it will be beneficial indeed.

20/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
21/12/23, 7:06 am - +260 97 1819712: Yes Sir, it is.

21/12/23, 10:41 am - +260 97 1819712: I understand the edoofa cycle to be the Edoofa students procedure of Enrollment starting with the personalized counselling session which I'am at.
Secondly is the Eligibility check test & interview.following up is the acceptance in the edoofa program.later comes the enrollment into the edoofa program,then admission after enrollment and lastly,admission Letter and visa. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/12/23, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/12/23, 11:05 am - +260 97 1819712: Quite understood.
Thank you!
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
21/12/23, 11:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
21/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 1819712: Not to despise other  options but I find the Earn while you learn an interesting feature,this is because the EWYL seems to agree with  the fact that Experience Is the best teacher,unlike learning without practical experience.
The EWYL does not only promise quality Education but has a scheme that assures students through hardwork and consistent effort might earn scholarship credits,which definetly helps in reducing financial funds and help further finance their higher education.
21/12/23, 12:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
21/12/23, 3:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
21/12/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 1819712: Honestly,I don't have a mentor neither any financial help, That's part of a reason I did apply for this scholarship.
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - +260 97 1819712: My apologies sir.I was a bit occupied at the moment.
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So will your parents not support you?
21/12/23, 3:40 pm - +260 97 1819712: Currently both my parents are not working but obviously they can afford to pay for the enrollment fee.

May we start please!. <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
22/12/23, 11:50 am - +260 97 1819712: Yes you did mention about it.
22/12/23, 11:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
22/12/23, 11:58 am - +260 97 1819712: Well understood Sir.
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
22/12/23, 12:16 pm - +260 97 1819712: Duly noted!.
22/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
22/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
22/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/12/23, 12:31 pm - +260 97 1819712: Quite understood.
22/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
22/12/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 1819712: Understood.
Thank you!
22/12/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down
