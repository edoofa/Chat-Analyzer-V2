We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

Im now ready to discuss with you

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 828 3084: Oka Mr Gurvinder

It's an honor to meet you sir Shubham... Senior Academican and Mr Jyotishman,Head of Admissions
12/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tadiwanashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Precious, is that correct?
12/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 828 3084: Yes that is correct
12/12/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Precious, also do tell me whether you learnt about Precious’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 828 3084: Okay through the journey with precious i learnt that through edoofa's network of higher education institutions, colleges,universities and employers that they share an aim to make quality higher education accessible and affordable, so that we students can pursue our dreams

It helps in scholarships with guarantee of 50% to 100%
Edoofa attachments,internships, and projects help you earn $50-$100 scholarships credits per month
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes Mr Gurvinder seeing my mom troubling to find money, she is a widow my father died when I was in fourth grade i had to look for something like this for myself
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: I am sorry to hear that.
12/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tadiwanashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes i have Mr Gurvinder
12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tadiwanashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Actuarial Science indeed relies heavily on these subjects, making them fundamental to understanding and excelling in the field. Your affinity for problem-solving indicates a natural aptitude that aligns well with the demands of Actuarial Science.
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Additionally, having your father pursue the same program serves as a great motivation. His experience and journey in Actuarial Science likely provide valuable insights and encouragement for your own aspirations. It's fantastic to have that familial connection and guidance when venturing into a field that your father has expertise in. Following in his footsteps can provide you with a unique perspective and support system as you pursue your goals in Actuarial Science.
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

13/12/23, 8:10 am - +263 78 828 3084: Good morning to you too Mr Gurvinder  and everyone
13/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
13/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 828 3084: Yes i understood the course
13/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 828 3084: Okay in five years time after completing a B.Com degree, I want to pursue a career in accounting. In that case, I would see myself working in the field of accounting five years after completing my degree. I would have gained the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the responsibilities of an accountant, such as preparing financial statements, maintaining records, and providing advice on financial matters. I would be using the resources available to me, such as professional organizations and networking events, to continue my professional development and advance in my career.I would be happy to help Edoofa program that provided the scholarship in any way I can. One way I could help is by being a positive ambassador for the Edoofa program and sharing my experience with others. I could write testimonials or provide references for the Edoofa program, or I could volunteer my time to help with events or outreach efforts. By helping the program, I would be showing my gratitude for the opportunity and giving back to the community
13/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tadiwanashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 828 3084: Im willing to give everything in my power in order to transform my career Mr Gurvinder
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I want to study abroad because i want to develop a global mindset which can beneficial in my career and life because when studying abroad Mr Gurvinder i am  exposed to new cultures,ideas and even the way of thinking
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I would aim to use my learnings Mr Gurvinder to help improve the education system in my home country Specifically I would focus on three areas: curriculum development, teacher training, and technology integration. By updating the curriculum to include more global perspectives and teaching methods, I would help students gain a more well-rounded education. By providing professional development opportunities for teachers, I would help them learn new teaching strategies
13/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tadiwanashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I agree with you Mr Gurvinder but from the hardworkings   i will put in my education i also see myself as a reputed personality in my country to help boost the educational system
13/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
13/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes it's correct
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Thank you Mr Gurvinder 🙏🏽
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

14/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 321 0600: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder and everyone my other phone has no power I'm going to use this one
14/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
14/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 321 0600: No Mr Gurvinder we are not familiar with cost. The one who was familiar was my father but he died 8 years ago
14/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear about your father.
14/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Tadiwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Are we still conneccted?
14/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 321 0600: Yes we still connected Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
14/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 321 0600: Yes Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Tadiwanashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

14/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

14/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
14/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
14/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 321 0600: So Mr Gurvinder if you get the scholarship and you have an average fee of $1500
Is it needed right away or you can make a payment plan were you can pay monthly half of the money
14/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: yes Tadiwanashe, the fees is always paid in installments.
14/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
14/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 321 0600: Definitely Mr Gurvinder i think this will help me
14/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tadiwanashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 321 0600: Now I get it Mr Gurvinder... This message explained it wonderfully
14/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 321 0600: You are so different and helpful... This was one of my dreams regarding my international education Mr Gurvinder im amazed
14/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Alright Tadiwanashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
14/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 321 0600: Mr Gurvinder i would say my mother as for my other family they abandoned us
14/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
14/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
14/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Yes i have discussed with her
14/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 354 4503: Good afternoon Mr Gurvinder and everyone

Surely sir i have discussed international education with my son and also from your previous counselling i saw that its beneficial
14/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
14/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Im ready Mr Gurvinder <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: Tadiwanashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 321 0600: He will end up spending almost $1150 to $2250 <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tadiwanashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 321 0600: It's okay Mr Gurvinder i understand
14/12/23, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 321 0600: I think so
14/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Tadiwanashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
14/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Okay Mr Gurvinder so this means that for the phase 1 you have found me competent for the program?
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Tadiwanashe, I am just explaining you the payment plan, the counselling session and the eligibility check evaluation are still left before we decide that, but we can finish the counselling session in 5 minutes if you stay active.
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Yes im still active Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 321 0600: No Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tadiwanashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
14/12/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 321 0600: I have understood Mr Gurvinder <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
14/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Okay so when will you give me the countdown dates for the $350 enrollment fee
14/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: After the eligibility check evaluation, if you are found eligible for this program, only then you will be asked to pay the enrollment fee.
14/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Okay Mr Gurvinder i don't have more questions
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
14/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 321 0600: So we are continuing the session tomorrow with my parents at 12pm
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, make sure you have a discussion with them about the program and please make them go through the Edoofa FAQ document.
14/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Surely Mr Gurvinder i will do so
14/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Thank you for the counseling session Mr Gurvinder have a blessed day🙏🏽

15/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.
15/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?

15/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 321 0600: Yes Mr Gurvinder my mother has some few questions.... I think she asked one of the question
15/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mafuse, the universities have affordable accommodations inside the campus only and moreover, if you want cheaper accommodations, you can stay outside the campus too.
15/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 354 4503: okay i understand what about if they finish their degrees do they have a chance to work in india or you sent them back home like other scholarships do
15/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mafuse in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 354 4503: ok its now make sense to me Mr Gurvinder
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 354 4503: im done Mr Gurvinder these are the only questions i had
15/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
15/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 354 4503: im aware Mr Gurvinder i will try my best to find it but as a single parent its gona be hard
15/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your situation, Mrs Mafuse.
15/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: So @263773544503 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263788283084 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
15/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 354 4503: 1) Bachelors of Accounting
2)India
3)6000 to 8000 usd
4)2000 to 3000 usd
5)the enrollment fee is 350 and it is paid in 7 days
6)Sure thing Mr Gurvinder ! From what I understand, the Earn While You Learn program Mr Gurvinder is a unique program that provides students with both an education and real-world work experience. The program helps students develop 21st-century job skills through live projects with industry leaders. These projects help students gain experience in the digital world, and provide an opportunity to apply what they've learned in the classroom. The program also offers scholarship credits, which can be used to offset the cost of education. Overall, it seems like a great way for students to gain practical experience and make their education more affordable.Additionally Mr Gurvinder the Earn While You Learn program seems to have an impact beyond the individual student. By connecting students with industry leaders, the program helps to create a network of professionals who are invested in the success of the program. This can lead to more opportunities for students, both during and after their time in the program. It's a win-win for everyone involved! I think that's what i understand Mr Gurvinder as a mother
7)Yes im following you i understand that the registration fee is essentiallu a part of the first year tuition fee
15/12/23, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: @263773544503 the course is called Bachelors of Commerce not Bachelors of Accounting.
15/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 354 4503: ok Mr Gurvinder  l understand
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 354 4503: Mr Gurvinder are we still connected ?

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

16 years after the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress. The country has rebuilt its infrastructure and economy, and has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting reconciliation and healing. However, there are still challenges that the country faces. In terms of infrastructure, Rwanda has made significant strides in rebuilding roads, hospitals, and schools. The country has also seen a significant increase in foreign investment, which has helped to boost the economy. The government's policy of "reconciliation villages" has been particularly successful in promoting healing. In these villages, people who committed genocide and people who were victimized by the genocide live together and work on rebuilding their communities. This policy has helped to break down barriers between people and has allowed them to learn to trust and respect one another. However, the country still faces a number of challenges. One challenge is the high level of poverty. Although the economy has grown, many people still struggle to make ends meet. Another challenge is the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which has affected a significant percentage of the population.Another challenge facing Rwanda is the issue of justice and accountability. Many of the perpetrators of the genocide have not been brought to justice. This has caused some victims to feel that their voices have not been heard and that justice has not been served. Additionally, there is a lack of trust in the government and institutions, as some people feel that the government has not done enough to address the root causes of the genocide. Despite these challenges, Rwanda has made remarkable progress in the 16 years since the genocide. The country has shown that it is possible to rebuild and move forward, even after such a devastating event. Rwanda's experience is an inspiration to other

My inspirational story

"I'll never forget the day my father died. It was a warm spring day, and everything seemed normal, but then my mother's face turned pale as she answered the phone. I could tell something was wrong by the way she spoke in a quiet, serious tone. My heart sank when I heard the words 'died' and 'hospital.' My father had passed away from a sudden heart attack. The grief was overwhelming, but my mother and I had to face reality and find a way to move forward. We had very little money, and paying for school fees became very hard The days and weeks after my father's death were difficult for my mother and me. We had to learn how to live without my father's income, and it was a struggle to pay for the necessities, let alone school fees. My mother tried to keep our lives as normal as possible, but there were many nights when we went to bed hungry. She did everything she could to make sure I had what I needed to succeed in school, even if it meant going without food or other comforts. My mother's sacrifice and determination were an inspiration to me and i vowed to make the best of my life and make something of myself. I am determined to make my father proud and live a life that honors his memory

The difficult times my mother and I faced after my father's death taught me many valuable lessons. I learned that resilience and determination can overcome even the most difficult challenges. With hard work and perseverance, we can achieve our goals, no matter what obstacles we face. As I look back on this experience, I am grateful for the strength and courage my mother showed, and I know that I can overcome any obstacle that comes my way. I am proud of what I have accomplished, and  I know that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and never give up.

The final scholarship percentage will be decided once you finalize the university you wish to study at. After this, our Academic Board and the University you choose their scholarship grant committee will then sit together and discuss your performance academically, in the Edoofa Eligibility process and then decide your final percentage!

*But for now, you have received a guaranteed 50% Scholarship*

25/12/23, 9:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any ther questions please/
25/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 354 4503: Yes Mr shubham if he has a 50% scholarship so that means i will pay the half right so when i pay the other half is accommodation and food included

25/12/23, 9:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: The Remaining fees will include their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
25/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 354 4503: Okay Mr shubham

25/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes i would like to ask about the cut  off points for B.com and points needed
25/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 828 3084: <Media omitted>
25/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Mr Shubham which combination do you want for someone to do a B.com degree
25/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me assist you with the same
25/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
25/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Thank you Mr Shubham now i understand
25/12/23, 3:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-2026.
25/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Okay i get it Mr Shubham.... So let us say my mom has paid the $350 and then when i get the final percentage of the scholarship, my mom sees that she cnt afford the rest of the tuition left 

How do you it does she get refunded?
25/12/23, 3:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please did you go through the phases of enrollment Tadiwanashe?
25/12/23, 3:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We will assist you and help you financially plan your education in such a way that your family will be able to pay your fees. So you need not worry about the same
25/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Okay thank you sir 🙏🏽
25/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I think im done sir with the questions
