14/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Sibanda D
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Adrian*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
14/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay thank you
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm now online
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Sibanda, How are you?
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm good thanks and how are you
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Adrian?*
14/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 1) My dream to pursue law. Going to university to do my tertiary education might prove to be a very challenging problem to my parents considering the hiking school fees and the drastically changing Zimbabwean economy. An Edoofa Scholarship is something that might definitely change my life forever since I would be granted an opportunity to pursue my dreams
14/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 2) from the discussion I had with Adrian I figured out that Edoofa is not just a scholarship program that offers and ensures accessible education for all despite nationality and race but it's definitely a life changing program that probably endows students with life changing skills since they even allow a platform whereby a student can learn while working as well. This not only builds a student academically but it also helps them be able to balance things in life given the scenario that they earn while they learn. It also helps them learn to depend on themselves hence destroying the dependency syndrome whereby students have to rely on their parents for everything which I believe is something that builds responsible and better human beings. I therefore believe Edoofa is not just any ordinary scholarship program but it's a life changing and extraordinary program
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Ok thank you
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*.

16/12/23, 11:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 318 4969: Yes we can
16/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Good afternoon. Yes we can
16/12/23, 12:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes I'm very much confident

16/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay thank you very much
18/12/23, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we can start
18/12/23, 11:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
18/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 440 8694: My apologies sir for not responding sooner I had challenges. There was no electricity and I had not charged the phone
18/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 440 8694: The reason why I want to study abroad is that I want exposure to the world outside my native country. Also fees for tertiary education in my country are hiking while the employment rate is super low hence studying abroad would probably guarantee me a good job and above all a platform to fulfill my dreams
19/12/23, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
19/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we can start
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Why are you replying so late?
19/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I had no data
19/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I only purchased it now
19/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please!
19/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we can start
20/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Not yet I have not really done any thorough research nor have I yet applied to any university abroad
20/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 440 8694: No I do not have any knowledge at all
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 440 8694: This is so much better and it's actually good considering the earn while you learn program
20/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Wow this is actually great and it lifts a heavy burden on both the parents and the students
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn  Program?
20/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes you can
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay this is really great
20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 440 8694: It definitely will benefit me so much. Being exposed to the industry whilst I'm still learning makes me 10 times better than my mates and the experience I get while working at the same time studying gives me a platform to learn how to balance my things . At the end of the day after I've graduated I believe that I definitely will not be in the same level with the people I might have attended classes with and done the programme with hence this working while learning program is an added advantage to the student, elevating them to an even higher level

20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
20/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 440 8694: This definitely something I would love to adventure into. I was honestly looking for an ordinary scholarship but this Edoofa program is just more than your typical average and normal scholarship but it has so much more to offer and something I would love to be part of
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we can start
21/12/23, 10:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 10:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 10:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
21/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 440 8694: Okay
21/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
21/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes we are
21/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 440 8694: This picture shows the stages that one undertakes in the journey of working to be admitted in the program. It shows the clear order of all the processes taken by one in the journey of being admitted. All the processes and stages are definitely important and missing one of the stages would mean serious disturbances and problems in this process of being admitted into the program
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay I understand
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
21/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?

21/12/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

22/12/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 440 8694: No you had not get told me😊 this is really great
22/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
22/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Wow that's actually awesome
22/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
22/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
22/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay I understand
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay I understand
22/12/23, 12:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
22/12/23, 12:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay clearly understood
22/12/23, 12:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down
