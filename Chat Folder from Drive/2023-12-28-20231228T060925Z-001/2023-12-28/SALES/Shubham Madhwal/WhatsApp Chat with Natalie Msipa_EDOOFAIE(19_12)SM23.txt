19/12/23, 7:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Since you *have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Kelvin, please reach out to your friend* to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?

19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I am a lively, confident and caring young woman. I am an avid reader of novels, a singer, artist and a good essay writer. I come from a family of six and I am the eldest. My family especially my mother, has been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me. I have been fascinated with studying in a field of science for as long as I can remember. I want to take up a career that would allow me to apply  the knowledge from school to make useful products in a clean, green and effecient way, to solve practical problems especially those that are health related and improve my communication skills. I aspire to pursue a program in the health sector  particularly, pharmacy.
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: 1. Partial funded

19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Theoretical knowledge is limited because one doesn't get to apply any skill practically causing confusion and a lack of understanding of knowledge.
Practical knowledge allows one to know whether or not they have understood what they have learnt and especially how to apply that knowledge.
The problems people face requires us to have practical knowledge not just theoretical knowledge
19/12/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I aspire to pursue a career in the health sector, particularly pharmacy. I am from Zimbabwe and main challenges students are facing is the issue of lack of jobs that one would have studied for at a university. Most people who are employed for a particular job that they did not train for that particular job in the first place. So pursuing a degree is risky because you might not get employment for what you would have studied. Learning abroad is an advantage because you can get a job for a program that you pursue. The quality of education is better in terms of advancement in technology and enrichment of knowledge. There are more job opportunities and a decent salary that accompanies it. For pharmacy studying abroad especially Studying in India is a greater advantage especially with enrichment of knowledge and practical skills

I want to pursue a  career in the medical field particularly in pharmacy, not for fame, but to create gender equity and to challenge myself and have confidence in my own ability especially in an industry that is male dominated. Furthering my education in chemistry will allow me to make a difference, produce produce an effective change for society's benefit and improve in my communication skills. The Edoofa scholarship will be the financial aid I need to do this.

20/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Hailing from a working class family, my name is Natalie Panashe Msipa. I am a lively caring young woman. Im an avid reader of novels and I enjoy drawing, singing and writing. I come from a family of six and I'm the eldest child. I have three siblings, two sisters and one brother. They are all still in school .My  mother is a teacher in Kwekwe and my dad is a miner and they  reached Advanced level in their schooling and also in further studies, they will be supporting me. My family especially my parents have been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me, to dream and work hard in life knowing that the sky is the limit. My parents have been financing my studies since first grade up to Advanced level in high school. I completed my Advanced level at Thornhill in Midlands province this year ,2023, were I was the Headgirl, public speaking and debate president and a member of the science club.  I'm currently waiting for my  Advanced level results. The school fees  was about  90 USD and RTGS depending on bank rate.l aspire to pursue a career in the health sector, particularly pharmacy. This is a sector that is a good investment and that would be needed by people for a lifetime. I desire to open my own pharmacies in my country to create employment and ensure community around are well served. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth? <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 235 7517: For grade one to grade 7 I attended Cecil John Rhodes school, in Midlands province. It was the building block for my life because I was elected as headgirl at seventh grade, this made me more responsible and self aware of my abilities to lead and work well with others.When we wrote Gweru District exams for grade seven, I was topper in my class, this awakened a hunger for studies which I have carried till now. For high school I was at Thornhill high school from form 1 to form 6. In form 1 I was in the schools girls soccer team and I learnt how to coordinate with others, in body language and verbal communication. Then for my fifth and sixth form my chemistry teacher, elected me to be the class rep, were I was the one responsible for organizing  experiments for chemistry, ensuring we had all the chemicals needed and that everyone else was fully prepared for the practical. For me that experience made me more responsible and conscious about the needs for others because if there were absence or depletion of certain chemicals in the experiment, I would report to my teacher and the lab technicians. In  my sixth form which was my final year, I was elected to be the Headgirl, which was an honor and a great responsibility. I learnt that being a leader is not always about dictating your own views but communicating with others well and representing and serving them well. It wasn't easy having to be strict and tough but it taught me the necessary skills of leading and helped me grow into a responsible, caring person. Being a member of science club for my fifth and sixth year taught me to be creative in the most unimaginable ways for example when we created a board cleaner using wash soap, vinegar and water. It was heart warming when the lab technicians encouraged us to always be creative. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to pharmacy, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Initially I wanted to go for medicine but the sight of blood gave me chills down my spine, thats when I decided to go for pharmacy, I get to help people but without having to view them. It allows me to communicate with people about their health and another advantage is that, I can start as an employee and after some time of experience and gain of knowledge, I can have my own pharmacy and create employment for others
20/12/23, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e the picture of results for O-Level and Upper-6 last term

20/12/23, 2:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Natalie, After understanding your interests and motivation
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Pharmacy*
20/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Thank you
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* is a 4 year undergraduate program which is compulsory for anyone who wants to practice as a pharmacist. B. Pharmacy is study of preparing and conferring drugs and medicines for a number of illnesses and deficiencies.

20/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Thank you for the information
20/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
20/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Yes I am confident
20/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So @263782357517 , Earlier you shared with me that you are aware of the fact that the Edoofa Program Recommends India as a higher education destination for higher education, So I am sure your friend Kelvin must have briefed you about the same?
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Yes he did
20/12/23, 3:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So please share your understanding of the same with me!
20/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 235 7517: The Edoofa program helps students like myself from Africa to pursue higher tertiary studies in India
20/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Thats what I had understood from the word go
20/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, And why do we recommend India for your higher education?
20/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please you are totally correct, 
Let me also show you some facts about India and several global leaders who are Indian graduates.

20/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Wow India is country to consider for sure
20/12/23, 4:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Natalie, as you are now aware, the reason why we recommend India as a higher education destination for your higher education, So I am sure your friend Kelvin must have also briefed you about the cost of Education here in India after you were aware of the Edoofa scholarship and also about the Earn While You Learn Program.

Can you comment about them in 100-200 words, So that I can get your understanding about the same and assist you accordingly?
20/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 235 7517: The Edoofa scholarship is partially funded and funds about 50 to 80 percent of tuition fee. Studying in India without a scholarship costs about $7000 to $8000 but when you get Edoofa scholarship it's about $2000 to $3000. What I understood about the Earn while you learn program is that you can get an internship that allows you to work and study at the same time. You also get scholarship credits while you are on an earn while you learn program
20/12/23, 4:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, And I really appreciate and admire your enthusiasm for the same. 
My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
20/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 235 7517: So what kind of projects and assignments embark on
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 235 7517: It is something to look forward to
20/12/23, 5:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
20/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 235 7517: I think the first step of personalized counseling session  is the step I'm on
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Sure thank you
20/12/23, 5:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
20/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 235 7517: My parents
20/12/23, 6:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
20/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Really thats a lot
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
20/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 235 7517: That is a financial relief
20/12/23, 6:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
20/12/23, 6:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
20/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 235 7517: So the guaranteed scholarship of 50 to 100 % depends on the number of points I get
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Okay
20/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
20/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
20/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
20/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Okay
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 235 7517: Noted
20/12/23, 6:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
20/12/23, 6:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

27/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263712736937*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
27/12/23, 2:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263712736937* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Natalie's* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Natalie's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
27/12/23, 2:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *04th or 05th of January 2024* for $200 and the *04th or 05th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *04th or 05th of January 2024*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
27/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 273 6937: Noted with thanks.
