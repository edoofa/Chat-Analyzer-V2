04/12/23, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

09/12/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 441 5087: I'm very confident

12/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 441 5087: @918527919212  can you highlight on this....Kelvin didnt highlight any of this
12/12/23, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: This is the net thing that we will be discussing in detail
12/12/23, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: OR
As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
12/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 294 4709: We do not know sir and tht is the reason why we are asking
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 294 4709: This is commendable considering that school are expensive here in Zimbabwe we will be greatful to get this sponsored program.

13/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 441 5087: Yes
13/12/23, 10:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
13/12/23, 10:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/12/23, 10:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Definitely!
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
13/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Its a process to get to admission and visa applications. But hw are the visa applied for.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
13/12/23, 2:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
13/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Noted
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
13/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
13/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 441 5087: First and last
U really get to know what u want to specialise on and not take the wrong program 
And the last point getting support is the most interesting aspect of edoofa
13/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
13/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 441 5087: My parents
13/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
13/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Yes u did mention that
13/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
13/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Noted
13/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
13/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 441 5087: What letter?
I understood
13/12/23, 4:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the acceptance letter!
13/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Okay
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 441 5087: That's so nice of the edoofa program to be considerate
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Understood
13/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

*What I want you to do is go through the letter along with your family so that they understand the process better. We will then again connect tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT to continue ahead*
21/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 294 4709: I see the letter only mentioned that  Chantell scored 90% but it doesnt mention the percentage of scholarship it only said btwn 50 to 100%. Is it not possible for us to know the percentage now so that when we discuss as a family we know exactly the figures tht we will be talking about
21/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Please for now you are guaranteed a 50% Scholarship*
The final scholarship percentage will be decided once you finalize the university you wish to study at. After this, our Academic Board and the University you choose their scholarship grant committee will then sit together and discuss your performance academically, in the Edoofa Eligibility process and then decide your final percentage!

*But for now, you have received a guaranteed 50% Scholarship*
21/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 294 4709: So the acceptance letter is based on the interviews tht you did. Are you still going to consider her A level results or they do not matter anymore
22/12/23, 10:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Chantell and Mr Zvenyika @263774415087 @263772944709 , How are you?
22/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 294 4709: Im good thanks
22/12/23, 11:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
22/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 294 4709: Im here
22/12/23, 11:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: So can you elaborate on your question/
22/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 294 4709: I was asking if the acceptance is only based on the interview that you had with chantell or she still have to bring her A level resuluts
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/12/23, 12:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you understand better now
22/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Understood
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.
22/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
22/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Well noted
22/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions you would like toa sk?
22/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Not now
22/12/23, 3:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in the acceptance letter?
22/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 294 4709: There is no deadline mentioned in the acceptance letter but according to my understanding it must be 7 days. Its unfortunate that its holiday season and banks are all closed for the christmas holiday. The only 1/2 working day is tomorrow thereafter public holidays until the 27th of December
22/12/23, 5:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Did you not  go through page 3 of the acceptance letter please

23/12/23, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the deadline is due  on 28th of December and the results  will not be out by February can you elaborate?
23/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Day Everyone
Please don't get me wrong but this is not the first time I am counselling any student, I have been doing the same for the past 4 and half years. I can see that you all are facing certain apprehensions and concerns about the scholarship process which you are not clearly sharing with me and hence are going inactive during your sessions for the same reason.
23/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.*
23/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This is a festive season for you all in which your entire family would gather around to celebrate. So I would request you all to take some time out for your child's education. Because inside you all know how this opportunity could benefit in shaping your child's career. Do give it a thought and note down all your concerns. *So that once we connect for our next session on Monday, at 08;00 AM CAT. then you can share the same with me and I could assist you accordingly to the best of my abilities.*
23/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 441 5087: He's driving currently he will get back to you
23/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 294 4709: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 294 4709: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Im here now
25/12/23, 8:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
25/12/23, 8:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning Everyone,  Merry Christmas to you all!

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application process, so shall we start?
25/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 294 4709: Good morning its difficult to make a meaningfull conversation on christmas day, a lot of events are lined up for the day
25/12/23, 8:46 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, please! So are you available for the next 30-45 minutes then?
25/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Im here for a few minutes
25/12/23, 3:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr Zvenyika. What is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in Chantell's acceptance letter?
25/12/23, 7:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *I personally feel there is actually something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with the process, And I am still willing to assist you with a solution if you wish to continue ahead and get your child enrolled in the Edoofa Program*

Otherwise, I am not forcing the scholarship opportunity on you at all, *If you do not wish your child to proceed ahead and succeed with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity then please come forward and confirm so that I can provide a formal closure to your application!*
25/12/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 294 4709: I write to propose that we start this process after Chantell's results end of January to early February.
26/12/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning Mr Zvenyika. 

Like the details mentioned in the acceptance letter. After 28th of December Chantell's acceptance letter will be revoked. 

That is her application will not be valid for the next 6 months and by then the enrollment fees will be raised to $750
26/12/23, 9:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: The minimum passing criteria for A level is 2 passes. Ie minimum D grades in 2 subject to be eligible for the 50% scholarship. If you do not think that Chantell will not be able to attain such an easy grade then. I believe we have maken a mistake in evaluating to consider Chantell in the first place. As her scholarship was on basis of her test and interview.
26/12/23, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: It turns out that We trust Chantell more Mr Zvenyika
26/12/23, 9:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Because @263772944709 As you may recall from the counselling session, the I informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with my special recommendation, as indicated, Chantell was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
26/12/23, 9:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Chantell's potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
26/12/23, 9:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: But the rest is upto you. If you still don't think that Chantell is capable then. I guess you are underestimating her potential
26/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 294 4709: Good afternoon, l will spend most of my day driving and l wont be able to attend to this conversation. I propose we continue with this conversation tomorrow
26/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted. I will request you to go through all the Messages I sent today first before we connect tomorrow.
26/12/23, 8:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
