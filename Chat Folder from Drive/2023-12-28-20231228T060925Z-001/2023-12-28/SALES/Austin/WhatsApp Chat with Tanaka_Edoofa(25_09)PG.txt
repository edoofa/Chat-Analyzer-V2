I hope you are confident about your child securing it!
05/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 398 6437: Yes I have more confidence, I'm sure he will score many points than what we expected

05/10/23, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Susan, I appreciate your belief in the potential for higher education through hard work, especially considering the current state of the educational system in Zimbabwe. Regarding Edoofa's recommendations for higher education, I'd like to inquire if you've already discussed with Edoofa which country they recommend for pursuing further studies,
05/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 398 6437: India
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Ms. Susan. So now as you are aware Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education destination.


I would be interested to hear your perspective on why you believe studying in India and within the Indian Education System would be instrumental in achieving your dreams. <This message was edited>

05/10/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So, can you now tell me

The first thing that I want to share with you is , we don't have much knowledge about Idea but we will follow your recommendations and encouragements because you are the one who knows better than us so as a guardian I will encourage my brother to work hard so he will pass his A level course so that he will pursue with his career and also on the other side of a coin I will show him the goodness of your progrem so that he will work towards it to achieve his goals.
05/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 398 6437: **about India not  idea****
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Susan, I'm delighted to hear that you found the information helpful. Your support and encouragement for your brother's education and career goals are truly commendable. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 398 6437: Without a scholarship it became hard for me or any of our family members to believe they is higher education in India . Our pockets are empty so it became more expensive to pay for our brother to proceed.
05/10/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!!!

Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

07/10/23, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin our session,

Shall we begin the session now?
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 858 3027: Morning sir
07/10/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 858 3027: We can start
07/10/23, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!



Please acknowledge this.
07/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 858 3027: Yes sir
07/10/23, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: It's good to hear that, Tanaka,

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
07/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 858 3027: I dont know . Do you tell me how to do this
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Tanaka, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 858 3027: My sister will
07/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 858 3027: And aslo brother
07/10/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, Tanaka,

So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 858 3027: They are encouraging me  to do so .
07/10/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanaka, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
07/10/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
07/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 858 3027: Yeah thts all i know
07/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 858 3027: And also reasults for a level
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Tanaka, 

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 858 3027: Yes sir
07/10/23, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tanaka, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
07/10/23, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/10/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.

*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).

*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
07/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 858 3027: Oky l understand
07/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 858 3027: Its oky l understand it

10/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 858 3027: Stage 1
10/10/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Tanaka.
10/10/23, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
10/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 858 3027: Oky sir l understand

10/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 858 3027: Yes sir yu can explain
10/10/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tanaka, *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
10/10/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
10/10/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
10/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 858 3027: Can you explain further on day to pay  registration fee
10/10/23, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tanaka, please note that the registration fee is supposed to be paid after you receive the offer letter/provisional letter from the University which would be towards the end of A level or after A level
