30/11/23, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?

01/12/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Are you ready for the same?
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - +265 887 79 80 08: Yes l am
01/12/23, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the financial issues, Faith, However, I would like to know will your parents not be able to save the amount of term fees they used to pay? and Have you compared the cost of education there in Malawi and through our program?
01/12/23, 1:19 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: U mean the amount we were paying in secondary school or?
01/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon, Ms. Connie,
I hope that you are doing well <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 1:32 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Am good thanks how are you
01/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Connie, The per-term fee that you used to pay Have you compared the cost of education there in Malawi with our program?
01/12/23, 1:35 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes we have
01/12/23, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Ms. Connie, Please note that it is a one-time investment once Faith is found eligible for the program. Once she qualifies and enrolls, she'll kickstart the process of earning valuable scholarship credits. These credits, averaging around 50-100$ per month, provide a significant opportunity for him to independently finance your higher education before she embarks on his journey to India. It's an investment that pays off in more ways than one. 

Also, you are cognizant of the employment challenges in Malawi, where many youths find themselves in low-paying jobs and endure difficulties. However, our program ensures that your child is well-prepared for employability and provides a guarantee of secure employment.
01/12/23, 2:08 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Okie we wil be able to save that amount
01/12/23, 2:10 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Now I understand
01/12/23, 5:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kindly excuse me for the delay.
01/12/23, 5:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, 

So, Are you willing to support Innocent for her higher education?
01/12/23, 5:34 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes we are
01/12/23, 5:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms Connie, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/12/23, 5:36 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Well noted thank you
01/12/23, 5:37 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Can I answer on her behalf?
01/12/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure Ms. Connie
01/12/23, 5:49 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: We have no issues with her studying abroad...... All we want for our child is to get the best education and we she has our support
01/12/23, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Connie, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at an even greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting your family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents.
01/12/23, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
01/12/23, 5:54 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes that's the requirements
01/12/23, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
01/12/23, 5:57 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes please
01/12/23, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
01/12/23, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 6:02 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Well noted
01/12/23, 6:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Stage 1 I think....
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Connie, That's right!!!
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes please
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
01/12/23, 6:16 pm - +265 885 17 63 51: Yes it is clear
01/12/23, 6:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
01/12/23, 6:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
01/12/23, 6:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
