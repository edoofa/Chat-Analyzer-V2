11/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 197 9498: Well  my main drive for studying abroad comes from the issue of Market... growth abroad.  Looking at some of the programs or degrees done in universities for example sociology....in economies like the one in Zimbabwe or most of the African countries it is very difficult to find real market for that kind of a job here . According to my research I have discovered that programs such as law , engineering,  tourism.... these ones still have a grip on the market especially abroad in countries with huge  economies
11/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 197 9498: Hence I think it is best to study abroad to have an advantage in market as well as due to technology advancement it is very easy to carry out researches as well as projects in these programs

11/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 197 9498: Well honestly speaking from childhood I have always loved tourism... I have always loved to travel. Going on a school educational trip to the Eastern Highlands in Zimbabwe can also be described as the fuel that generated more love for it.
11/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 197 9498: Through seeing different documentaries concerning the different parts of the world I have also loved the idea even more... however due to the still heart for others I intend to make it a dream come true for the less privileged

So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
13/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 197 9498: Mmmmm no not really
13/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 197 9498: All I know is its very expensive
13/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: What all did your friend Taisha discuss about this with you ?
13/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 197 9498: She  actually mentioned that the scholarship covers a certain percentage of the needed amount depending on the pass rate as well as cooperation of the willing student in this case me
13/12/23, 12:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Blessed! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
13/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Let me  ask
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Blessed. I will be waiting for your response.
13/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Thank you
13/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 197 9498: So is there a chance whereby I could be expected to pay less that maybe 2 or 3 thousand dollars
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessed. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 197 9498: I actually have a question on that
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 197 9498: How does that work or should I say what's the process  ...how is it done
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessed. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Well I wanted to ask....is there a chance for me to be working in a Job that is in line with my study program
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Also so I will be going to school at the same time going to work ?
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to inform you that EWYL won't conflict with your classes. You will have the opportunity to take on projects during your free time and create a timetable for these projects based on your convenience. Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 197 9498: So I will be working during My Semester breaks and then come back for classes at the appropriate time
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessed. You will get to work on assignments on a daily basis at your convenience.
13/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 197 9498: So on this I will be working in line with my study program ?
13/12/23, 1:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Blessed. The Assignments will be relevant to your course, please. May I know whether you think think this will be beneficial for you, please?
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Am sorry I just wanted to have a better understanding of it
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Yaaa I think it will be beneficial yes
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

13/12/23, 2:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
13/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Yes
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 197 9498: So I wanted to ask on issues to to with transport cost ....am I responsible for my traveling costs or the scholarship covers that as well
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessed. If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not flight tickets because the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe once or twice, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So, they learn and do internships during breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
(air fare :-around $400) is to be borne by the student which is mostly a one time investment.
13/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Oh I see
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 197 9498: I understand yaa mostly there is no travelling unless when one is fully settled
13/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Well to be honest they are all so so unique and really interesting and worth of double appreciation  and its a bit hard to select the best from them but I think I will appreciate at this moment the issue of Employability through practical training where one is equipped with necessary skill and knowledge through both information as well as gaining experience to dealing with different people and situations.
13/12/23, 2:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Blessed! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
13/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 197 9498: True
13/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Well me being the first to engage in such ...I think its a bit overwhelming but if am not mistaken they seem to be also interested in the issue
13/12/23, 2:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate their concerns, please?
13/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Well I just asked my Mom and she said yes we are interested
13/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Yes we are interested
13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 197 9498: 🔥🔥🔥 this is amazing
13/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Actually know nothing much about this but yaa I think these are the things mainly checked
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
13/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Wow this is amazing
13/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
13/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Oh ok this sounds better
13/12/23, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
13/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 197 9498: The program enables one to have easy access to education by helping them with tuition, food and  accommodation , as well as visa applications ... it also helps the student through employment while in education as well . This henceforth decreases the financial pressure on the student.  Which actually  places the student steps ahead in as far as financial issues are concerned
13/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

13/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Thank you
13/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Ok
13/12/23, 3:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly answer the question, please?
13/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Sorry the picture was still downloading
13/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 197 9498: I think I am on stage 2
13/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 197 9498: About to go on stage 3
13/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Yes please
13/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Wanted to ask on the $500-1000 ....is this different or separate from the 350 or what
13/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessed. This registration fee isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself ($2000-$3000).
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Oh ok....so the whole 2000 is paid in installments but the 500 part of it is the one that is needed first to secure my place at the university?
13/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Blessed.
13/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

13/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 197 9498: Well for now I think I don't have ...but if any I arises I will surely ask 🙏
13/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Blessed!
13/12/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
13/12/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

14/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 197 9498: Yes
14/12/23, 9:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

14/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 799 7049: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st or 22nd December 2023 for $200 and the 21st or 22nd of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st or 22nd December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
14/12/23, 9:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for Saturday at 10:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day.

16/12/23, 2:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Regina. I wish to draw your attention to the fascinating parallels between Indian and Zimbabwean cuisines, underscoring the shared elements that reflect a delightful convergence of culinary traditions. Despite the geographical expanse that separates our cultures, both Indian and Zimbabwean culinary landscapes celebrate a rich tapestry of flavors. The use of aromatic spices, the incorporation of fresh and seasonal ingredients, and a reverence for communal dining are notable commonalities. From foundational staples such as rice and bread to the diverse array of vegetables and meats, the similarities in essence are unmistakable. While each culture exhibits its unique spice palette and culinary techniques, the fundamental spirit of uniting people through delightful and nourishing meals is a shared value. Exploring the nuances of Indian cuisine may offer a profound appreciation for the cultural resonance it shares with Zimbabwean gastronomy!

19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly provide more details about your concerns regarding the financial dates, Mrs. Regina? I assure you that I am here to address any issues, and I will make every effort to devise a more accommodating financial plan for you. There have been instances in the past where parents expressed their concerns to me, and in response, I advocated to the board for an extension of the deadline to ensure greater convenience for them.

19/12/23, 5:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that there are some challenges for you in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
19/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 191 3896: Thank you for taking our challenge to the Academic Board. We really appreciate.
19/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 191 3896: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Blessed's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Blessed's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
19/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 09:00 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session

How are you doing today ?
26/12/23, 8:23 am - +263 77 799 7049: Good morning ...

We are doing well.. thank you...
26/12/23, 8:41 am - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you the payment modes in depth ?
26/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 191 3896: Good morning, we are fine. Thank you.
26/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 191 3896: Yes, please do
26/12/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
26/12/23, 9:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
