19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes it is.
19/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 574 5393: This idea is exactly the one l am looking for.
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Employability skills is a scarce commodity in most of us(students) so may you kindly shed more light on that point. l need to understand.
19/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please be patient, let us continue the counselling session, your every concern related to this will be addressed ahead.
19/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Craig, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes indeed sir.
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now Craig, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

23/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

23/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

23/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Wow, sir it sounds like India will actually change the future of the world through its big success. Looking at CEOs Indians are the ones ruling big  companies. I look forward to seeing  India succeed. If l get a chance to get a scholarship in India l would be very happy because l have heard that your country has a larger majority of 
english speakers and can improve my tongue. Sir those pictures have touched me, l hope my country will copy from your country and also become self sufficient in future.
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now Craig, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir l wanted to ask that do you do your studies in English only or you do mix with your native language.
23/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Thank you for sharing these links, have a Merry Christmas filled with joy. We will meet on Tuesday.
26/12/23, 8:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
26/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 574 5393: How are you sir.
26/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Please, the medium of Education in India is English only.
26/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir l also wanted to ask that suppose l am on  Edoofa scholarship do l seek my attachment or or you do provide.
26/12/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Please, let us be patient and move ahead with the counselling session, as all your concerns will addressed ahead automatically.
26/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 574 5393: Noted, thank you for notifying me.
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 574 5393: Actually some of my family members know a little bit.
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so this means that  students can pay the remaining tuition fee through the Earn While You Learn even in their first year at the University.
26/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
26/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes sir please do explain.
26/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Craig, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Alright thank you for shading more light on the program.
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

SHARE SEMINAR POSTERS THEN THE BELOW MESSAGE

These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 574 5393: In my on point of view, it benefits at a greater extent because students can have knowledge on aspects like advertisements, technology, and lastly they can learn through experience.
26/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Craig, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes l am sir
26/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l have seen that this program plays a pivotal role in promoting students and also gaining excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits. It also helps students to learn and develop 21st Century job skill like research, content writing,  SEO, Digital marketing, creative content creation.
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Craig, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir the main reason l have applied for this scholarship is that most of my family member are poor, my wish is to get assistance from you.
26/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: By bringing down your fees from $6000-$8000, are we not giving assistance?
26/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Pardon me sir l did not understand properly.
26/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Craig, we have brought down the your fees down to $2000-$3000, the EWYL program helps you reduce the cost down more, but for rest of the cost, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for that?
26/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so how much must my family members pay
26/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I have given you the range of the cost of education after the scholarship, how much you are able to reduce it depends on you.
26/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 120 6156
26/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Alright l have understood  that it is payed after the scholarship.
26/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 120 6156: How Mr Gurvinder. l'm Craig's brother. Thank you for adding me
26/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 120 6156: How are you Mr Gurvinder. I'm Craig 's brother. Thank you for adding me
26/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you.
26/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l will be proactive as you have said.
26/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 120 6156: Okay sir will be proactive
26/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Craig as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Suppose student A applies in 5 universities he/she pays about a sum of $1500-$2250 in all.
26/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Craig, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so in January the price will be $750.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok it is well but currently on my side things are still tight and l don't have the amount right now.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Craig basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok thank you for notifying.
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 574 5393: No sir l am not.
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Craig, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Now l have understood the cycle far much better thank you.
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
