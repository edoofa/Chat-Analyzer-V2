We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
12/12/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 142 0001: Yes yu are talking to the right person....how are you Mr Gurvinder Singh

12/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Larndrone, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Pritchard, is that correct?
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 142 0001: It's fine
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes it is
12/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So can l ask ...how did yu get in contact with Pritchard
12/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Pritchard, also do tell me whether you learnt about Pritchard’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Nothing much...he just told me the advantages of studying abroad,and he also told me that edoofa is reliable
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Oka yha he once told me about that tooo
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Thank you
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So approximately my fees will be how much per year
12/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please be patient, as everything related to this will be addressed ahead in counselling session.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Larndrone, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 6:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/12/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Noted ...l didn't know that you have your specified time ....l am very sorry
12/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes ...

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
15/12/23, 8:00 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 8:06 am - +263 78 142 0001: Good morning how are you doing
15/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: I am well, how are you?
15/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 142 0001: I am going great
15/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Larndrone, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. 
But seeing your passion for the Subject of Biomedical sciences and your passion for creating your drugs so that what happened to your aunty doesn't happen again, I have a course that would be perfect for you, do you want to know what?
15/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes l would like to know the course
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Biotechnology offers a wide spectrum of possibilities that extend beyond the boundaries of biomedical studies. While both fields delve into the intricacies of life sciences, biotechnology opens doors to a broader scope of applications. Here's why it might be the ideal choice:

Diverse Applications: Biotechnology isn't confined to healthcare alone. It spans agriculture, environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and more. This diversity provides a broader platform for career growth and innovation.

Innovation Hub: Biotechnology thrives on innovation. It involves cutting-edge research, genetic engineering, and the development of new technologies. It's an exciting field constantly evolving with groundbreaking discoveries.

Industry Demand: The biotech industry is rapidly growing, offering vast career opportunities globally. Its multidisciplinary nature attracts employers from various sectors seeking versatile professionals.

Interdisciplinary Approach: Biotechnology integrates knowledge from biology, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. This multidisciplinary approach fosters a holistic understanding and skill set.

Societal Impact: Biotech innovations contribute significantly to society, addressing global challenges like healthcare, food security, and environmental sustainability.

While biomedical courses focus extensively on medical applications, biotechnology provides a more expansive canvas for those passionate about science and its diverse applications. It's a field that propels scientific discoveries and offers opportunities to contribute to multiple sectors, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a versatile and impactful career.
15/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yeah its a gud course but l would like to study biomedical sciences
15/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, since you have understood the potential of the course, the course being finalized to you is : *BSc Biotechnology*
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
15/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
15/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 142 0001: No it can't be ....if it is that  my qualifications are for biotechnology then l might go somewhere not lndia it's still okay because l like medicine not biotechnology
15/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So stay blessed l will look for another...
15/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate what do you mean.
15/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel like you have misunderstood.
15/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Oka what do you mean by Bsc Biotechnology
15/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I think l misunderstood for sure
15/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *BSc Biotechnology* is a 3-year undergraduate course that allows the candidates to learn how technology is utilized to create useful and necessary products from living organisms.

15/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 142 0001: As for me l would like to study biomedical sciences which is medicine
15/12/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Well Larndrone as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
15/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 142 0001: That one is not a problem..
15/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 142 0001: So if it is l don't qualify it doesn't matter l will try another chance anywhere in the world
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Thanks for your time
26/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Hello
27/12/23, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Larndrone.
27/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 142 0001: Good morning how are you
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 142 0001: I am fine
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 142 0001: Would you still qualify me for biotechnology
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what changed your mind?
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 142 0001: It's like l was thinking to go to Zambia and my parents ain't support education in zambia
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Larndrone, let me tell you that you woul have got admission in medicine there, but I am counselling Zambian students also who share their stories that their elder siblings have done their degrees but still fail to get employment, but here in India, in the final year of the course, every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!
27/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I was also told that by my parents

27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
27/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I was planning to donate chemicals to different schools and universities that is if things go well...
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Larndrone, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 142 0001: I. Agree with yu
27/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/12/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 142 0001: Yes l used to ask others that same question
