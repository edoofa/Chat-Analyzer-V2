What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I have learnt that Edoofa is helping young people to  acquire good education facility in India 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I want good education facility which is not there in my country and some of the degrees that are offered in my country are not internationally recognized.

27/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 445 2768: He told me that there is enrollment fee,scholarship fee and school fees.
27/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 445 2768: And also the amount is determined by the school.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
27/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?

27/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 445 2768: I don’t have any limitations
27/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 445 2768: I will be active in all counseling sessions.
27/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Now Anotida, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

27/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
27/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Noted
27/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 445 2768: I hope it will work out
27/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 445 2768: 100% confident
27/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Noted sir
27/12/23, 8:09 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
