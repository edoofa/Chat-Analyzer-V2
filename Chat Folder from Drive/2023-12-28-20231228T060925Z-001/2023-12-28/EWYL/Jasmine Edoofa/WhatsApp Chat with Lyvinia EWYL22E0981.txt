*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.* I've noticed that you were going through several challenges leading to your absence from recent sessions, and I want you to know that I understand. That's why I've adjusted the session timings. Now before our next session, I'd appreciate it if you could answer the following:

▪️Could you share the reasons behind your recent session absences?
▪️Are you confident in your understanding of all the EWYL projects? If so, which one is your favorite project?
▪️Can you promise 🤞🏼 to attend every session moving forward?
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.*

I haven't been present for my sessions due to loadshedding in our country hence my phone would be switched off also attending sessions in the afternoon would sometimes appear to be a very big challenge for me
My favorite project is the *Community building project*

It's time for the session

Quickly come on the EWYL Line and address your presence by chanting out loud

I hope you are doing good. 

Finally the day has come where you will learn new skill, yes it is time to collect your _*WEDNESDAY WISDOM*_

So, quickly come to the EWYL LINE and follow the ritual of chanting a mantra *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
Make sure to complete the lesson and your targets before our session on Friday.
