26/12/23, 12:08 PM - +263 71 584 8678: Greetings to you all
Christmas was celebrated very well in my family . Christmas is a special day to all Zimbabweans because people will celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. As for me Christmas is special because I will meet and socialize with all other family members. A cow will be killed to celebrate the day we will also wear new clothes and eat special food that is expensive. Before we celebrate the day we go to the church first to pray so that the day will be celebrated very well
26/12/23, 7:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening Shalom* 🌝
