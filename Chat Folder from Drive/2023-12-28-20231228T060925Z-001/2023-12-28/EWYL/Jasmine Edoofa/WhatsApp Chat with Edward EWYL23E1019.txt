*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.*
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings*
23/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
26/12/23, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Edward,_*👋🏼
Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?
26/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So before we start, I couldn't stop myself but ask, how was your Christmas? 🌲
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Was very fyn and yours
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great to know. You know this year, I spent a quiet and reflective time with my family, cherishing the festive spirit. We gathered for a festive meal, exchanged heartfelt gifts, and shared stories. 
The holiday season is a wonderful time to appreciate the warmth of family and friends
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Wow wonderful
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you, dear. Last time we discussed Project 3

Do you remember?
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yeah
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I have it
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
Goodnight Edward
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Same Mam

Today I am a little occupied with the planning for the event so I would like to reschedule the session to tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.

Kindly excuse me for the inconveniences caused but don't worry we will definitely make up for it tomorrow.
Have a nice day ahead.
