 1) *Daily Morning Ritual:* Each day, we'll kick things off by saying, "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL Line every morning. 🌄 Let's remember that being an Edoofian means being a strong advocate for positive change, focused on self-improvement, and dedicated to making our families proud. The sky's the limit for us as true Edoofians! 🚀
