27/12/23, 10:34 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that electricity issues and connectivity gaps are not in our hands but I would suggest that you either use the hotspot facility for connecting with me or use someone else device for connecting.
I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth is our priority right.

27/12/23, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, Tafara. Your understanding of all this is my priority. It is not about this one session, or the EWYL Program, or Edoofa, but for life, and yes, in college this fits best. You have to find a solution for every problem when that thing is directly linked to you.
