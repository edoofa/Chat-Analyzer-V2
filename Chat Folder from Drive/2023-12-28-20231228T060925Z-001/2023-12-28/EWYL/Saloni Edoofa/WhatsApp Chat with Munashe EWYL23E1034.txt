26/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Concerning the document,my understanding is that the EWYL document is a guideline of the EWYL projects.It consists of the basic skills to achieve your career goals and have a secured future.It consists of two projects the corporate alliances and the African Schools Education Reform Mission.The document tells how to handle the projects and it offers guidelines on how to carry them out.Also,it  tells of the credits awarded after completing each stage of each project and how it has an effect on your annual tuition fee.
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have done it well!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I will do exactly as you said.
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you listen to the audio?
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am done with the process and would like to confirm that I understood the audio profile.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes,Ms.Saloni I did
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

27/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 78 307 6096: From the audio profile,I understood that the projects have certain objectives which includes gaining an understanding of the markert you want to enter in the future and begin to plan for it at an early stage.It also gives an opportunity to connect with technology driven and digital companies.This can be obtained by following the task of identifying such companies in your country or regionally by starting to enquire from your immediate network.It also gives an understanding of how the mentor will help you in achieving the project.It also teaches the student to be patient.
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Munashe, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

27/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 78 307 6096: Yes,I read and understood about the projects . I am also ready to start the process and earn credits.

27/12/23, 1:54 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Munashe? I can help you.
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 78 307 6096: For now I can confirm that it is understandable and I am satisfied with the explanations.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Lovely, then we will move forward!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Munashe, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Munashe!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I listened to the audio profile and understood it.
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
27/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I understood that the second project works towards community building.It teaches Edofians community building by strengthening connections, communication, relationships and sharrling identities with a certain group of people or individuals.The project ,creates an environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging.They can collaborate, communicate and work towards common goals.This project is there to foster  a positive   community that promotes social introduction and participation in a shared responsibility and ownership towards achieving the little success.The primary outcome of the project is for students to gain good networking skills,and how to use social media to offer African students an opportunity to join the Edofians Educational ecosystem and acquire international education that can prepare them for their future.This is obtained from identifying willing youths who are willing to pursue the program and connect them with Edoofa .The Edoofa will also assist the students so that their efforts will not go to waste.The project teaches students to identify opportunities and use them to  change the lives of others.
27/12/23, 2:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
27/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 78 307 6096: I am also looking forward to connecting with you on the scheduled time slot tommorow.Thank you for the day.
