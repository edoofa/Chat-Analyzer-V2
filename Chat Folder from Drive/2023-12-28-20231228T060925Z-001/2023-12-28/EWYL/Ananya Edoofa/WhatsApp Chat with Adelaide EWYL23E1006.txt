26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adelaide! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Alright ma'am. I have successfully approached 2 students to join the Edoofa team and created the groups and added you
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's lovely, Adelaide!
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 78 653 1903: One of them, Daniel, is asking about studying medicine. I asked him to redirect the question to you. May you kindly assist
27/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Please help
27/12/23, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Adelaide, in India, to study medicine, one has to be Indian as it requires sitting for a government exam.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 78 653 1903: Ohh ok. Thank you
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 78 653 1903: With regards to what ma'am?
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here, Adelaida!
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 78 653 1903: So I'm supposed to create a list and reach out to headmasters/principals of local high schools in my region and tell them about Edoofa and help them create synergies
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.
