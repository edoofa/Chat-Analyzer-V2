I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was so excited to talk to you about the Christmas celebrations, however, you did not show up! May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Geilen! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 977 5405: How are you doing mentor
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I have observed that you have not been consistent and punctual in attending your sessions. As your mentor, I am concerned about your progress, and I would like you to discuss with me if you are facing any challenges. How will we learn and earn credits if you do not attend the sessions on time?
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Currently I am on my way to Mutare.. Coming from our farm where I have been facing network issues
27/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You have been inconsistent since 12th of December, Geilen!
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Pardon for that... Sorry for not staying in touch.. I was away and couldn't have access to my usual communication channels
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

27/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 977 5405: Ok mentor... The venture is looking for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA, eager to extend their assistance in the overall development of all the students that enroll for EDOOFA programme
There are factors I should take into consideration and these include nature of company, financial stability, background and founder etc...
