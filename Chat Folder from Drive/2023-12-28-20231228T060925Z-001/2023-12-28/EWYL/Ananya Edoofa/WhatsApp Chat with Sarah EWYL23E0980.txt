Then one needs to check different social media pages of the company then understand the background of the founder and it's core members.Then lastly check the background of people associated with the company.

27/12/23, 9:01 AM - +265 987 57 92 74: I will gladly share it to my friends who are interested
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/12/23, 9:06 AM - +265 987 57 92 74: So can I tell the people who haven't started their sessions  to send the forms again so that I can send them to you
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Sarah!
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - +265 987 57 92 74: Oky then
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 9:18 AM - +265 987 57 92 74: Alright  go on
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
