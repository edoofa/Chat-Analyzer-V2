23/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Elina!

Please excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas in our office, and I was occupied with decorating the tree. It went really well!

You all will go at the same time.

27/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Elina,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +91 89680 53859: Sorry ms Ananya I've been busy with exams
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +91 89680 53859: Happy holidays...hope you have a joyous and fulfilled holiday
