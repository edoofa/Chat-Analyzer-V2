26/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, today I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 756 4664: That is amazing
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very clear
26/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 77 756 4664: On it
26/12/23, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.

26/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 77 756 4664: I went through the document and l figured out that the program is intended to give us skills for the future and an awareness of jobs and support our education and learnt about the skills emerging like Data analytics and remote team-work and the two projects that l'm going to be able to do namely cooperate alliances and community building and an outline of the activities and how l'm going to navigate it.Thank you
26/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
