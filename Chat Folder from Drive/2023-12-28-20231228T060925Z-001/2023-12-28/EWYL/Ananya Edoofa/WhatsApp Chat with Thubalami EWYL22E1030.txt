I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?

27/12/23, 4:04 PM - +91 86996 80020: Apologies from me,
I was offline for quite a while, financial issues, and as you said, it has not been a holiday for us, with all these on going exams on a season we are used to be relaxing, it's quite complicated for us , for me in particular, it's too much of a task,
It's not out of lack of acknowledgement, but the pressure is just too much for me
