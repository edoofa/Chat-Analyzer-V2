I hope you are doing well. Please excuse my delay in connecting with you earlier. I trust you understand that, due to a high volume of applications, our counselor requires 15-20 days to connect with each student. This time is necessary for a thorough understanding of the application form. During this period, I recommend that you maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.
