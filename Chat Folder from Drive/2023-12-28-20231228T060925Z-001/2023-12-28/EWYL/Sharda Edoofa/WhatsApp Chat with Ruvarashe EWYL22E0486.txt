I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good morning ma'am.. I'm doing well thank you.
26/12/23, 8:45 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Thank you for the quote that's a powerful one I will also save it.. I celebrated Christmas in style, we were at a youth camp which was very funand powerful

26/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh yes.. We had culture nights where we got to know and celebrate the unique and diverse cultures with different displays  in Zimbabwe. We also had mountain climbing learning about the nature  surrounding us and how God communicates to us through it
26/12/23, 8:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: That sounds like an incredible and enriching experience! Celebrating culture nights with diverse displays and engaging in activities like mountain climbing to appreciate the nature around you is a fantastic way to connect with the world and each other. Learning about the various cultures and understanding the messages from nature adds depth to the celebration. It seems like a meaningful and memorable Christmas celebration!

27/12/23, 7:20 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good morning ma'am... From the above documents I have discovered that EWYL is a program whereby we study whilst applying what we've learnt practically helping us to gain practical skills.. Also it is beneficial in that we get access to networking with other people and it provides a lot of opportunities be for us to volunteer in
27/12/23, 8:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Morning Ruvarashe*
As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀

In these powerful words, Pichai unveils the magic of embracing challenges. Failures aren't roadblocks but rather detours leading to invaluable lessons and remarkable achievements. 🌟

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good morning ma'am... I'm doing well how are you?

27/12/23, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay great Ruvarashe.
27/12/23, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.
In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
27/12/23, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.
The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
27/12/23, 8:46 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay.. Thank you it's a pleasure to know them😊
27/12/23, 8:50 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Thank you so much for your endless efforts 🙏
27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You're very welcome!
27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You're truly appreciated! 🌟
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay I can't wait to learn more 😊
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
27/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am that's noted
27/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 78 181 2643: But on Saturdays I'm m required to complete the tasks by what time since almost the entire day we will be attending church services
27/12/23, 9:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: No, you are not supposed to submit the task on saturday. You can send the response before your next session which is either on Monday or Tuesday. So this should not be a concern.
27/12/23, 9:01 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay thank you for the clarification
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You are very welcome please.
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly skim read these documents and do let me know once done.
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the newsletters?
27/12/23, 9:16 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am I was just finishing up the last one

27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
27/12/23, 9:20 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
27/12/23, 9:23 AM - +263 78 181 2643: All sections are very powerful but I liked the section 2 the most
27/12/23, 9:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes that is true.
27/12/23, 9:24 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh yes its also my wish too
27/12/23, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great that is.
27/12/23, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
27/12/23, 9:27 AM - +263 78 181 2643: It's very clear ma'am
27/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Great.
27/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
27/12/23, 9:30 AM - Sharda Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, let's carry the warmth of Christmas joy forward. 🎄✨ Wishing you ongoing moments of joy and looking forward to our next session with enthusiasm! 🤗🌟
27/12/23, 9:30 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay let me start working on them
27/12/23, 9:30 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Thank you ma'am 😊
27/12/23, 9:30 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great, sure. You can go ahead with that.
