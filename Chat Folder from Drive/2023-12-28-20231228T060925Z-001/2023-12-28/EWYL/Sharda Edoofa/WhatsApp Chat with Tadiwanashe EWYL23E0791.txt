Since we could not have our session on Monday due to Christmas holiday, *I would like to reschedule our session today at 12:00 am today.* I would like to ensure that you do not miss out on any learning opportunity along with the ongoing festive fun. 

Kindly come to the EWYL Line at 12:00 pm confirming you are ready for the session.
