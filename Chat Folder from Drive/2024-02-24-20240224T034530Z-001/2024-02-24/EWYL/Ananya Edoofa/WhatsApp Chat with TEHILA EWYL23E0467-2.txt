To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!

7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:05 PM - +260 97 7850766: Okay thank you for the notice
11/1/24, 10:12 AM - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to you, Tehila!

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 11:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! Now, I know it took me some extra time to find the pictures for you, and our session could not take place. We shall now resume our session on Monday. Meanwhile, I want you to follow your EWYL ritual daily so that you can receive the weekend activity.

Not only this, but since this week is completely off for you, I want to know your progress with your projects. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed for a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?
11/1/24, 11:13 AM - +260 97 7850766: Okay noted
22/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tehila
I hope you are doing well. It's a new week, and I'm eager to connect with you on your EWYL line. Please join your EWYL line to proceed with our session!
24/1/24, 10:55 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Tehila, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable*. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.
24/1/24, 11:23 AM - +260 97 7850766: Okay and am so excited for your coming 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
25/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 12:52 PM - +260 97 7850766: Wow sounds like it's very beautiful
7/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @260977850766 @260950590514 

I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Zambia region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern. <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 12:05 PM - +260 95 0590514: Good morning we are fine actually we are in a different town from where cholera is.
7/2/24, 4:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! By the way, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 1 offline application form with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
11/2/24, 7:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tehila!

With an upcoming visit to Africa on the horizon, I know that we won't be able to connect for our regular sessions for a short while. However, as your mentor, I am committed to ensuring your continuous development and progress.

In light of this, I've discovered an incredible resource that I believe will greatly benefit you. It's about utilizing AI to learn *multiple languages* uniquely and interactively. Personally, I've found it to be incredibly effective as learning multiple languages not only enhances your *employability but also prepares you for global opportunities.*🌏

So, go and explore the world of different languages with your fingertips!. Here's the link to get started: *https://wordtap.net/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-learn-a-language/*🌟
22/2/24, 12:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tehila @260950590514 @260977850766 

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet. 

I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.🚀
