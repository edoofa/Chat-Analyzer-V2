28/12/23, 1:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Melani,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 1:17 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Hello mam
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - +27 74 745 8105: I am fine,yes mam the grant is very significant to me
28/12/23, 9:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Melanie, you have been missing all the sessions and calls. 
Can you please explain the reason of your absence and how is the grant significant to you.
28/12/23, 9:37 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Which session did l miss mam
28/12/23, 9:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I believe you have not attended a single session from this schedule, Melanie.
28/12/23, 9:38 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: What about this call
28/12/23, 9:40 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Am sorry mam
28/12/23, 9:41 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Is there any way l can cover up? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 9:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Make sure that you don't miss any session in future
28/12/23, 9:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Melanie, may I know that are you willing to work on the projects because seeing your absence I am getting an image that you don't care about the EWYL Program.
28/12/23, 9:45 PM - +27 74 745 8105: Ok
28/12/23, 9:45 PM - +27 74 745 8105: I do care mam ,am sorry l gave you the wrong picture <This message was edited>

I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 12:12 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The DSW team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Jasmine. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While a new mentor has not been assigned just yet, I want to assure you that efforts are actively underway to identify a suitable mentor who aligns with your goals and aspirations.

In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.
