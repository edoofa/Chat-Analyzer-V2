16/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, you are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on 17th of February which is tomorrow. 
- If you are recommending any of your friends(Non Edoofians) along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for 18th of February(8am/1pm) or 19th  February(1pm). They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
16/2/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
