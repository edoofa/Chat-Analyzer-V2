24/1/24, 4:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: However, In the spirit of ensuring that your learning and growth never stop, I am sharing this Wednesday's lesson with you as I believe it's crucial to maintain the continuity of your education and growth. So, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities.

6/2/24, 3:15 PM - +91 76961 94887: There is this quote I like *in a world of lies and liars,an honest work of art is always an act of social responsibility* by Robert Mckee, here is a story, a boy and girl were playing together the boy had a collection of marbles the girl had some sweets with her, the boy to girl that he will give all his my boss in exchange of her sweets.the girl agreed. Jab boy kept the biggest and the most beautiful my side and give the rest to the girl, the gave him all her sweets as she had promised. That night the girl slept peacefully but boy couldn't sleep as he kept wondering if they girl had he hidden some sweets from him the way he did with his best marble, *the moral of the story is if you don't glue hundred percent in a relationship,you will always keep doubting in any relationship, so give your hundred percent*
