7/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 081 5279: I'm glad to here that because that is what we wish for him
7/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
7/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam I wish to acquire my degrees abroad also I want to be employed while I am in varsity so that I can manage to pay for my higher education for the last semesters
7/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 081 5279: So in the long run I wish to come back to my community and open a business resulting in creation of employment opportunities for local people thus improving standards of living
7/2/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a commendable goal! Pursuing your degrees abroad can offer invaluable experiences and perspectives. Additionally, seeking employment while studying is a proactive approach to managing your finances and gaining practical skills. It's essential to plan strategically and stay focused on your academic and professional objectives. With dedication and perseverance, you can achieve your aspirations and excel in both your studies and career endeavors.
7/2/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Thus I'm hoping that the EWYL will help me in achieving all these goals

7/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
7/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Please shed more light
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

8/2/24, 8:30 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Good morning Maam
8/2/24, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning on this beautiful day!☀️
I trust you're doing well.

Are you prepared for the session?🚀
8/2/24, 8:39 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Yes Maam we are fully prepared for the session just that the network connection here is very poor so please bare with us
8/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
8/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/2/24, 8:46 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Noted
8/2/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/2/24, 9:06 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Very interesting
8/2/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

8/2/24, 9:26 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Indeed it is great
8/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
8/2/24, 9:29 AM - +27 83 434 2213: It sounds very interesting
8/2/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

22/2/24, 9:15 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam let me brief you on the EWYL team I have. 
There is Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the Department . 

We also have Ms  Davi, who is the Head coach and she mentors us through her content and structured curriculum .

2 My mentor Ms Aditi Kapoor has set some goals for my EWYL journey to be a success thus I noted the following : 
1. To make sure that my academic journey is great
2. To ensure that I am  given enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education there in India!
3. She also emphasised on, working towards attaining the objective - that I am  learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare myself for the real-world workplace and help me grow holistically

3. Mr. Angad Singh the founder of Edoofa interact with us students via Newsletters

4. The Hall of Inspiration according to what I caught from Mr. Angad Singh it is that no one is never immature or young to make decisions for example the was this student Nkosilomusa Jecheche I caught a lot from him as he highlighted that leading religious groups helps you become a good leader and a good citizen. So for one to be a good leader he or she must promote change in his or her society not to fight change In brief I caught that Edoofa hall of Inspiration helps one to becone a good leader and someone who is valuable in the long run in the community
