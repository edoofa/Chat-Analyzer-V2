15/1/24, 1:00 AM - +263 71 611 2479: Good evening mentors and directors it's Loccadia l will like to sincerely apologies for not being available for my sessions the reasons is l was away from home and l had lost my phone so l had anticipated by now l would have bought a new phone but the finances are not bulancing.

Now moving forward  l managed to pay the enrollment fee which was 350$ but  due to serious financial imbalance at home  l failed to secure a sit at Galgotious university it was not easy  we tried all we could but things are not going so good this time around  , considering that my father is the only one working and the pay is not enough to meet our expectations it made it difficult for me to obtain the amount that was needed in such a short period of time, .
Having an opportunity to study in India has always been my dream and l was willing to put my all in it and further my education by finance is my only barrier to do so . 
The Alevel results are out and my results are as follows 

History A
Sociology A
Ndebele Language A.

I was wondering if by any chance do you offer a fully funded scholarship, also l have been meaning to ask what happens to the 350 since l have failed to raise money to secure a sit in the university .
Again l apologize for the inconveniences that I have caused by my absence THANKYOU

Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

21/2/24, 6:18 PM - +263 71 611 2479: Yes
22/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 611 2479: No we reside in Nkayi
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr.Charles Jerera ’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/2/24, 1:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr.Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
