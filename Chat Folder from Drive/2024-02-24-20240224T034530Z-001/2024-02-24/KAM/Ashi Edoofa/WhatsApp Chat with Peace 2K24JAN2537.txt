6/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/2/24, 6:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
6/2/24, 6:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 6:25 PM - +263 77 137 2401: It is clear.
6/2/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/2/24, 6:29 PM - +263 77 137 2401: If it is possible, we can start the first step of the admission process.
6/2/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/2/24, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
6/2/24, 6:31 PM - +263 77 137 2401: I am ready to receive and watch the videos with understanding.

6/2/24, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have gone through the videos
6/2/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 137 2401: I would like to note that I have gone through the  videos
6/2/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 137 2401: These videos have taught me a lot of important aspects to be successful as an edoofian.Some of them being 
1) being an individual who is  open-minded and being a student who is capable of following instructions.
These aspects were explained in the first video, and these are important qualities of a successful edoofian.
The next video explained the vision of edoofa.
Good attitude and following instructions increase a students capacity towards success.
This makes students more responsible and independent.

The third video explains the preparation on how one can interact with universities
They explain that edoofa has chosen the top 250 universities to work with.
The owners have undergone  ten years of hard work in observation of institutions.
According to my, there is a high chance that edoofa will help me get enrolled in a good university. That helps me by providing EWYL.
6/2/24, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights: <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
6/2/24, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
6/2/24, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
6/2/24, 7:41 PM - +263 77 137 2401: I understand that these choose universities offer a culture were education and friendship is found.
6/2/24, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
6/2/24, 7:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
6/2/24, 7:49 PM - +263 77 137 2401: In the fourth videos, an individual has to prepare a statement of purpose that helps offer a great opportunity for a first impression.It helps an individual get a scholarship in a school. It convices a college why they can admit an individual.
In a statement of purpose, one has to include goals and visions.
6/2/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 137 2401: I agree, and I was capable of understanding from the videos.
6/2/24, 7:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?

7/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 77 137 2401: I used word pad to type this document.
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Questions 3 

WHAT IS GLP, AND WHY IS IT FOLLOWED IN THE LAB.

Good laboratory practice is a set of principles intended to assure the quality and integrity of the clinical laboratory. It is a quality system covering the organisation process and conditions under which non clinical laboratory studies are planned performed, monitored, recorded, reported, and achieved. GLP ensures the quality and integrity of safety test data submitted to the government for the issuance of research permits.Good laboratory practice include acts such as tie back long hair,jewellery, or anything that may catch in equipment,never eat food or drinking beverages in labs and following instructions directed by your supervisor, In a way these are the regulations followed to ensure safety in labs.GLP is followed in the labs to ensure sound and repeatable non clinical research. It also prevents cross contamininatin,chemical leaks, and infection. It plays a role in improving the protection of human health and the environment to prevent the creation of technical barriers.
7/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 77 137 2401: QUSTION 4
Sterilisation methods are teqnique that are used to keep the materials used in labs safe for use. There are different sterilisation methods. These include Autoclaving, which is the most popular method,Dry heat which is considered to be the most effective method.The third method is filtration which does not require heat. Radiation is also an teqnique used In sterilisation.

Radiation
Radiation use can make excellent techniques for lab sterilization. Ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays are the kinds of electromagnetic radiation that swiftly pulverize DNA.

In air, UV has limited penetration capabilities. Basically, what this means is that the sterilization will only occur in a relatively small area directly within the lamp. However, it’s one of the more safe methods of sterilization. It’s often used in small areas such as laminar flow hoods.

Gamma and x-rays have excellent penetration capability. While this makes them inherently more dangerous, it also means they’re effective for sterilization on a much larger scale, 

Imporntance of sterilisation:
To prevent cross-contamination and provide safe working conditions for laboratory workers.
7/2/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Question 5 

They are different teqniques used to place specimen under microscopes, and these include

Dry mount: A specimen is placed on a slide with or without a coverslip over it. This method is useful for viewing dry specimens such as hair or pollen.it also protects the specimen from dust and other factors that can hinder observation.
The next method is 

Wet mount: A specimen is placed on a drop of water on the slide, with a coverslip placed over it. This is often used for viewing cells.wet mounts and suspending specimens in fluids such as water, brine, glycerin, and immersion oil. A wet mount requires a liquid, tweezers, pipette, and paper towels. specimens in fluids such as water, brine, glycerin, and immersion oil. A wet mount requires a liquid, tweezers, pipette, and paper towels.it can be used to view living specimen.

Smear Slides:

Smear slides require two or more flat, plain slides, cover slips, pipette, and tissue paperIdeally, smears should dry naturally in an environment of moderate, steady temperature.

Squash Slides:

Designed for soft samples, squash slides begin by preparing a wet mount; place lens tissue over the cover glass; gently press down, careful not to destroy the sample or break the cover glass, and squash the sample; remove excess water.

7/2/24, 11:09 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Noted
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
7/2/24, 11:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 03rd March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/2/24, 11:14 AM - +263 78 424 5544: We have paid 100 percent. Let me share the last receipt paid last week to make $350.
7/2/24, 11:15 AM - +263 78 424 5544: <Media omitted>

7/2/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Right @263784245544, So you have the remaining amount of $200 right ?
7/2/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 424 5544: No I have paid all let me send also the first $225 which was paid through Ecocash.
7/2/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please
7/2/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 424 5544: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 424 5544: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:22 AM - +263 78 424 5544: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 424 5544: This will make a total US$394 including Bank charges
7/2/24, 11:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt with us. Let me share them with the accounts team.
7/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 424 5544: On the other one, the bank had to re write using a red pen because the receipt was not very clear, you van confirm the deposit with Mr Jerera
7/2/24, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 11:28 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Yes he is planning to arrive in August so that it gives us times as parents to raise the necessary money for his travelling and his upkeep as he will be settling in there in India.
7/2/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/2/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/2/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/2/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/2/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Yes.
7/2/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/2/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/2/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/2/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Indeed.
7/2/24, 11:38 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 11:39 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Yes we are indeed
7/2/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
7/2/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/2/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Noted
7/2/24, 11:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
7/2/24, 11:43 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
7/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 137 2401: I can Clearly understand
7/2/24, 11:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 11:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/2/24, 11:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/2/24, 11:48 AM - +263 77 137 2401: Okay, I can understand.
7/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 424 5544: We are following, its clear.
7/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 424 5544: We hope he will be accepted in your universities.
7/2/24, 11:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 11:55 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Us parents have no queries, we wish him the best after all this process.
7/2/24, 11:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/2/24, 11:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
7/2/24, 11:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
7/2/24, 11:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 137 2401: We are very excited and hope we will be successful.
7/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 424 5544: You mean on the Zimbabwean flag, all those where Zimbabwean in 1023. I pray and wish Jim the same for 2024. Its incredible.
7/2/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 424 5544: 2023👆
7/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 424 5544: wish him
7/2/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
7/2/24, 11:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
7/2/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 137 2401: Indeed we are very delighted and excited
7/2/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 424 5544: For sure
7/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
7/2/24, 12:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
7/2/24, 12:02 PM - +263 78 424 5544: We are expectant of every good news in this process.
7/2/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 424 5544: No kindly elaborate
7/2/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
7/2/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
7/2/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
7/2/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 424 5544: Quite relieving indeed. That makes more achievable
7/2/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 12:14 PM - +263 78 424 5544: It quite clear and understable
7/2/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
7/2/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 424 5544: Well understood
7/2/24, 12:16 PM - +263 78 424 5544: Yes if possible let him be amongst the 31
7/2/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.

20/2/24, 9:44 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Morning
The discussion was not very formally. I asked all my question  while from outside but not to seat and discuss line to line on the letter.
I got an explanation on the off campus and on campus residence. We talked about fee payment issue.
Let me say I'm happy about the school.
But my challenge remaining now is on registration fee. I got the offer letter on the 16 February 2024. 
My funding is salary based, I'm now waiting to be paid for this month so that I deposit the registration fee hoping that my salary  will come through before or on the 28 of February 2024
20/2/24, 9:50 AM - +263 78 424 5544: I currently have us$300. I wanted to it  make a commitment fee to show that I accept I'm only waiting for my salary. I was then advised to consult the team on that arrangement which truthfully I failed to do as I ended up rushing for transport because the last bus was almost leaving back home.
Kindly assist I just wanted to make a payment of that amount to just show my commitment for the place with the university. But I can make my payment anytime from tomorrow since these are my dates of salary deposits.
20/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 78 424 5544: If ever they may be delays kindly assist me to get an extension of offer days up to the second of March. But usually I don't get paid after the 28 of every month.
I have also applied for a bank loan which  I am also expecting before 2 March 2024.
If you may realise, you will find that I have made efforts in preparation of registration fees. Kindly assist me to reserve the university seat for my son. He should definitely join the University.
20/2/24, 9:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263784245544, I hope you are doing well!
20/2/24, 9:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I can truly see the commitment you have for Peace to enroll him into the university, I appreciate the same.

20/2/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing a brief of the discussion with me. As you mentioned that you have $300 for the registration fees, you can make a payment of the same by tomorrow to show the commitment and for the remaining fees we will have a discussion accordingly please don't worrry <This message was edited>
20/2/24, 10:00 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Yes definitely he should be coming. Yes the 14 days of registration fees are nit yet lapsed I hope my salary will be through before that
20/2/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Thank you tomorrow is a holiday here allow me to pay on Wednesday first thing in the morning.

Kindly, assist, I have tried all my banks for the payment and they are all saying they don't send money out side but they just receive only.
Update me on how other Zimbabweans are making the payment.
I now have US$500 a to send as commitment fee
22/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263784245544, I hope you are doing well!
22/2/24, 9:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know the payment mode you were using ?
22/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 424 5544: I wanted to do a bank transfer from my bank account
22/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 78 424 5544: Western Union are also saying they just receive and do not send out
22/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
