13/2/24, 11:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Text @263773861078
13/2/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Firstly , my name is Matipashe Prince Chiponda and i'm the only child in my small family. I'm a Zimbabwean citizen born into a humble family with constrained resources. With the situation at hand , education became my only hope. I worked tirelessly throughout my years in high school oftenly sacrificing my sleep and other social activities , fortunately my hardwork paid off. I then started to look for a conducive environment where i could study for my tertiary education in terms of a scholarship. In the quest , i found Edoofa meeting my needs. My father being a manager at a hardware company and my mother serving as a teacher in a private institution , i'm confident that in terms of scholarship they are capable of paying the remaining fees till i graduate. These individuals have been supporting , and they will be supporting my educational plans both finincially and morally. Thank you.
13/2/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey. Your dedication and hard work are truly commendable. I'm thrilled to hear about your success and the support from your parents. I believe your determination will lead to continued success in your tertiary education. Wishing you all the best on this exciting new chapter!
13/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 386 1078: You're welcome and thanks to you too.
13/2/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
13/2/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I'm available but with my guardians i'm not so sure as greater part of the day they'll be busy at work. It's wise to confirm with them.
13/2/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263773861078, In the meantime, Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

16/2/24, 9:24 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Good Evening.
As i indicated earlier my respected admission officer , i won't be able to make it to the summit due to circumstances beyond my control. I stay more than 400kms away from Harare and i won't be able to make it to these events. I also wanted to come as i stated in my latter text , but i helplessly can't do so.
17/2/24, 6:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263773861078, Wishing you a good day!
17/2/24, 6:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand that @263773861078, we will surely share some insights with you about the event. On this note, Shall we start our today's discussion ?

19/2/24, 9:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/2/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes continue
19/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Noted.
We can move forward.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/2/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/2/24, 10:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Following
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/2/24, 10:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/2/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Crystal Clear.
19/2/24, 10:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes
19/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes , we can move forward
19/2/24, 10:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you
19/2/24, 10:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 10:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/2/24, 10:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 11:51 AM - +263 77 386 1078: From this video i assimilated that students who are enrolled in the Edoofa Program are grateful for the opportunites provided by the organization , the also feel a sense of independence due to the scholarship credits earned through the EWYL program. In order to lead a successful journey with Edoofa you must be open to learning , reachable and never blame circumstance for your failure. Last but not least , to reach your full potential as an Edoofian you must be able to follow instructions and be open-minded.
19/2/24, 11:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have watched all the videos
19/2/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I realized that Edoofa doesn't only help you with scholarships but it also provide vast opportunities to an individual. At the end of the day it's up to the student to make use of all the opportunities available and  be open minded or to have a limited mindsent. Students must follow instructions and ask advice and guidance from their experts.
19/2/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've grasped that the Edoofa Team have invested a lot of time creating systems and relationships which help them associate with top-notch accredited universites. The team also make an effort to enroll the student into a varsity which makes the student employable and worth after graduation. A lot of time is invested in finding the student eligible through counselling sessions etc , this equips the students with basic skills like communication , confidence etc
19/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've noted that the SOP is an important document which will help me get admitted into a good varisty , it shows my capabilities and why i'm worth getting enrolled in the specified university
19/2/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I've watched all the videos and the feedback is above.
Thank You.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i understood . Thank you.
20/2/24, 10:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263773861078, How are you doing ?
20/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 386 1078: I'm well thanks
How are you ?
20/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking
20/2/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
20/2/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes we're
20/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
20/2/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/2/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 386 1078: *Question Number 2 Response*
Myopia , commonly known as nearsightedness , is a refractive error of the eye that cause distant objects to appear blurred.
Here are some of the key causes: 
1. Genetic Predisposition" Myopia tends to run in families. If one or both parents have myopia , the likelihood of the offspring having the condition is higher
2. Lack of outdoor exposure: Limited time spent outdoors , especially during childhood , has been linked to higher prevalence of myopia. Outdoor activities are believed to have a protective effect against myopia development.
3.Environmental Factors: Excessive near work activities such as reading or prolonged use of digital devices increase risk of myopia.
Factors like eye structure and shape can contribute to the condition.

However the condition can be corrected in a number of ways: 
1. Prescription Glasses: Eyeglasses with concave lenses are the most common and simplest way to correct myopia. These lenses help to diverge incoming light and focus in properly onto the retina , providing clear distance vision.
2. Refractive Surgery: Surgical procedures like LASIK( Laser-Assited In Situ Keratomileusis) and PRK( Photorefractive Keratectomy) can reshap the cornea to correct myopia.
3.Orthokeratology: Involves wearing specialized gas-permeable contact lenses overnight to temporarily reshape the cornea. Regular use is necessary to maintain the corneal shape.
21/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 386 1078: *Question Number 3 Response*
I think Lasik surgery must be considered a medically corrective procedure because its primary purpose is to correct refractive errors and improve visuality. It aims to reshape the cornea , the clear front surface of the eye , using a laser. Lasik corrects the refractive error and allows light to focus directly on the retina. This leads to clearer vision without the need for corrective eyewear.
While Lasik surgery can have cosmetic benefits this cannot be used to define it because its main goal is to correct refractive errors and improve visual acuity.
Lasik surgery must not be recommended for individuals with a pre-existing retina defect because the retina is a crucial part of the eye responsible for capturing and transmitting information to the brain. If there is a defect in the retina, such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration, or other retinal disorders, LASIK surgery can potentially worsen the condition. Mainly it's because LASIK primarily focuses on reshaping the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, to correct refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. It doesn't directly address or treat retinal conditions.
21/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 386 1078: *Question Number 4 Response*
Here are some of the effective techniques to maintain a goodeyesight:

1. Regular Eye Exams:  Regular eye check-ups can help detect any potential vision problems or eye conditions early on, allowing for quick treatmemts and attendence.
2. Eating a Nutrient-Rich Diet: Foods rich in antioxidants, vitamin A, C and E, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids are perfect for eye health. Examples include leafy green, colorful fruits and vegetables, fish, nuts, seeds, and legumes.
3. Good Hygiene: Washing hands to regularly prevent the spread of infections, avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, as it can introduce bacteria and potentially cause irritation or infection.
4. Good Visual Hygiene: Maintain proper posture and distance when using digital devices or reading. Make sure that the screen or reading material is at a comfortable distance.
5. Protecting eyes from Sun Exposure: Wearing sunglasses that provide UV protection when you're outside, even on cloudy days. Prolonged exposure to UV rays can contribute to cataracts and macular degeneration.
6. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle: Obesity and conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure can increase the risk of developing eye problems. Adopt a healthy lifestyle by engaging in regular exercise, maintaing a balanced diet, and managing chronic conditions.
21/2/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 386 1078: *Question Number 5 Response*
Here are some of the key causes of lazy eye syndrome especially in kids:

1. Genetics: The condition can have a genetic component, meaning children with a family history of the condition may have a higher risk of developing it.
2. An obstruction of vision in one eye during early childhood can disrupt the normal visual development. Conditions like droopy eyelids(ptosis) and cataracts can cause such blockages.
3. Strabismus: it is a condition characterized by misaligned eyes. It can be caused by a weakness or imbalance in the muscles that control eye movement. When the eyes are misaligned, one eye may become dominat while the other is suppressed leading  to lazy eye syndrome.
4.  If there is a condition that prevents clear and focused vision in one eye during early childhood, such as a congenital cataract or a corneal scar, it can lead to deprivation amblyopia. The lack of visual stimulation and input during the critical period of visual development can result in lazy eye.
21/2/24, 10:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
21/2/24, 10:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 29th February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
21/2/24, 10:39 AM - +263 77 386 1078: I want to believe so , it's wise if you confirm with @263772839309.
21/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please confirm @263772839309
21/2/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 283 9309: I can confirm that arrangement are being done for the payment to be done on time !
21/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
21/2/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Optometry* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes that's accurate.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes.
21/2/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/2/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/2/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes that's correct.
21/2/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
21/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes we're.
21/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
21/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
21/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i'm clear.
21/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
21/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
21/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Noted
21/2/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/2/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
21/2/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

21/2/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/2/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 386 1078: No i don't have.
21/2/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/2/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
21/2/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

21/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Thank You.
21/2/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/2/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
21/2/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i am..
21/2/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
21/2/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
21/2/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
21/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 386 1078: No i'm not , you can ellaborate more.
21/2/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
21/2/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/2/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/2/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Ohh that's interesting.
No i don't have for now.
21/2/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 386 1078: No i don't have.
21/2/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 77 386 1078: Yes i am
