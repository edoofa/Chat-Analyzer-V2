I hope you are doing well. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $375 for your university registration fee is due by the 11th of January. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $375 by now?

My objective is to help you with a more flexible payment plan for Joy's university registration fee, ensuring that it aligns with your request so that you can secure the scholarship seat within the given timeframe.
11/1/24, 12:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To ensure alignment with your preferences, I would like to get a confirmation from your end for the same payment plan. If you find this plan acceptable, I can connect with the team to explore the feasibility with the academic board. Hence, I would like to know if you are comfortable with the following payment plan, and do you believe it aligns with your financial capabilities?
