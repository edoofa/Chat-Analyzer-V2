I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am, let's proceed
19/2/24, 10:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/2/24, 10:38 AM - +263 77 485 5312: I take note of the process ma'am
19/2/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/2/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/2/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/2/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/2/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Very clear ma'am.
19/2/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/2/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/2/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/2/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/2/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/2/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/2/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am
19/2/24, 10:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/2/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am
19/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Good afternoon.

20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with me. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/2/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 349 9806: The videos are very educative and have great vision.From Margret 's father.

21/2/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 485 5312: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that rights are things that you are entitled to, while duties are things that you are obligated to do. For example, a human right might be the right to freedom of expression, while a duty might be the duty to respect the rights of others. Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to, while civil rights are the rights and freedoms that are granted by a country's legal system. These rights and freedoms are the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, and the right to equal protection under the law. 

 Human rights are considered to be universal, meaning that they apply to all people, regardless of where they live or what their background is. They are based on the idea that all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Civil rights, on the other hand, are specific to a particular country or legal system. They are granted by the government and are often included in a country's constitution or other legal documents. Civil rights are designed to protect the rights of citizens and ensure that everyone is treated fairly and equally under the law.
21/2/24, 8:17 AM - +263 77 485 5312: 3. There are several key differences between a prosecutor and an attorney. First, prosecutors are government employees, while attorneys may work for the government or in private practice. Second, the primary responsibility of a prosecutor is to enforce the law, while an attorney's primary responsibility is to represent the interests of their client. Third, prosecutors are generally focused on criminal cases, while attorneys may handle a variety of legal matters. Fourth, prosecutors have the authority to bring criminal charges against individuals, while attorneys do not have this authority.  Prosecutors must follow strict ethical guidelines, while attorneys have more flexibility in how they represent their clients.


 Prosecutors have the authority to decide whether or not to bring charges against someone accused of a crime, while attorneys do not have this authority. Instead, attorneys provide legal advice and representation to their clients, who may or may not be accused of a crime. Prosecutors are also subject to a higher level of public scrutiny than attorneys, as they are responsible for ensuring that justice is served. Finally, prosecutors work closely with law enforcement agencies, while attorneys often work independently.
21/2/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 485 5312: 4. I would like to become a civil lawyer because a

- Civil lawyers can help make a positive difference in the world by resolving conflicts and protecting rights.
- Civil lawyers have a unique opportunity to learn about different cultures and ways of life as they work with clients from all walks of life.
- Civil lawyers can help people and businesses resolve disputes in a way that allows them to move forward and focus on the future.
- Civil lawyers have the opportunity to develop a wide range of legal skills, from contract drafting to trial advocacy.
- Civil lawyers often have a flexible work schedule, allowing them to balance work
21/2/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 485 5312: 5.I believe l have my best skills are in oral communication and I believe this can make me a successful lawyer because a lawyer is one of the people who should be able to explain things very clear and understandable to the clients and colleagues.
Also l am good at research and analysis, since a good lawyer need to find information and apply it to a specific legal situation. So with these skills l think I will be a successful lawyer . 
For example when it comes to communication skills, l am one of the people who can negotiate with people and hear ones side and make a decision out of that.

21/2/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 349 9806: This message was deleted
21/2/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Margret, I hope you are doing well!
21/2/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for the academic questions, May I know if you have completed the SOP form as well ?
21/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 77 349 9806: We are very fyn and how are you.
21/2/24, 9:31 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am well thank you for asking
21/2/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 485 5312: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 9:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
21/2/24, 9:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 13th March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
21/2/24, 10:01 AM - +263 77 349 9806: You have received $60.0 from Mapepa Jimmy with Ref no. R20681073, click the link below for more details https://wa.me/263785887013/?text=REDEEMR20681073
21/2/24, 10:02 AM - +263 77 349 9806: I paid it yesterday to Mrs Jerera whom l was given by Madam Harmehak.
21/2/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your Enrollment Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
21/2/24, 10:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am it's accurate
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/2/24, 10:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes you're right
21/2/24, 10:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/2/24, 10:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/2/24, 10:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/2/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
21/2/24, 10:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
21/2/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am
21/2/24, 10:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.* <This message was edited>
21/2/24, 10:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
21/2/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 430 4040 joined using this group's invite link
21/2/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am
21/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
21/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
21/2/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am
21/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
21/2/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am
21/2/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/2/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 485 5312: As for me personally I don't have any, l don't know my parents side.
21/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I would like to assist your query. In the meantime. Let's move forward
21/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
21/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
21/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 485 5312: This looks great 👌
21/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Well noted ma'am
21/2/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/2/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
21/2/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 485 5312: I am super excited ma'am
21/2/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 349 9806: As the father lm also eagerly waiting for the exciting news.
21/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
21/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
21/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
21/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes ma'am.
21/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
21/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Noted ma'am
21/2/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Personally I am ok with it, not knowing my parents side
21/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I shall wait for their response
21/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Ok ma'am
21/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/2/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 485 5312: Yes I am really excited about it
21/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 349 9806: The paying for registration fee in two part is a well come development which l hope m going to soldier on to pay it.Paying it once was going to be difficult for me.Thanks once again for that new development.
21/2/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.
