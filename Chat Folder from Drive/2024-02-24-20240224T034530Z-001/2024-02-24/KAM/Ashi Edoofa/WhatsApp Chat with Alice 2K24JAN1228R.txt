23/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

24/1/24, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @265989911912. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 6:38 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I have to fill in the 6 parts by today?
24/1/24, 6:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Today we are introducing these steps to you only we will discuss them in our upcoming sessions
24/1/24, 6:40 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright understood
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Good afternoon...I was wondering if there is a session today?
25/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265989911912
25/1/24, 2:52 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: How are you doing
25/1/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:53 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm done
25/1/24, 2:54 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: You may explain
25/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
25/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
25/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
25/1/24, 2:55 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I have seen the videos...even on instagram
25/1/24, 2:55 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I have to write this?
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes they are
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will help you in writing the SOP dear
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 2:56 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I appreciate this
25/1/24, 2:57 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
25/1/24, 2:57 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Dually noted
25/1/24, 2:57 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I am
25/1/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
25/1/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/1/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
25/1/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
25/1/24, 3:00 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand
25/1/24, 3:01 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes they are
25/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
25/1/24, 3:01 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: This message was deleted
25/1/24, 3:03 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes ma'am
25/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
25/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
25/1/24, 3:05 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
25/1/24, 3:06 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: You may sharr
25/1/24, 3:06 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Share them
25/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you, I am sure you must be excited for the videos

25/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
25/1/24, 3:12 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: This $500 is different from the $350 we are paying
25/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265989911912. The $350 is the Edoofa Enrollment fees and $500 - $1000 is the registration fees at the university
25/1/24, 3:14 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Ok
25/1/24, 3:48 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I've watched this one
25/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Once you have gone through all the videos please do let me know
25/1/24, 3:57 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Done with the second one
25/1/24, 4:15 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Please share the form
25/1/24, 4:16 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: With the situation I'm currently in including my ID and passport, what happens then.
25/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265989911912 Have you gone through all the videos ?
25/1/24, 4:30 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
25/1/24, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: These videos mostly teach students that they have to follow instructions from their counselors because it speeds up their application process. They emphasize on how they shape students on employability through the EWYL Program.  The founders outline the importance of documentation including the SOP letter .
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265989911912 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
25/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
25/1/24, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
25/1/24, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
25/1/24, 4:38 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
25/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/1/24, 4:39 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: We're on the same page
25/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
25/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

26/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: 2.Social structure is a complex web of relationships, institutions, and norms that shape individual behavior within a society. It acts as both a constraint and a framework for individual actions. While society is not merely a figment of imagination, it is also not entirely constraining. 

Individuals navigate within predefined roles, influenced by factors like family, education, and economic class. These structures provide a sense of order and stability but can also limit personal freedom. Social norms, for instance, guide behavior, and deviation might lead to social sanctions.

However, society is dynamic, and individuals contribute to its evolution. Cultural shifts, technological advancements, and political changes redefine social structures over time. Society is a collective construct influenced by the interactions of countless individuals.

In essence, social structure both constrains and liberates individual action. It offers a framework within which people operate, yet individuals play a crucial role in shaping and reshaping these structures, making society a dynamic and interactive phenomenon rather than a mere figment of imagination.
26/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: 3.Sociology and economics are interconnected disciplines that study human behavior from different perspectives. Sociology examines social structures, institutions, and interactions, exploring how they shape individuals and societies. Economics, on the other hand, focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.

The relationship lies in their mutual influence on one another. Sociological factors, such as culture and social institutions, impact economic behaviors and decisions. Meanwhile, economic structures can shape social relationships and inequalities. The distribution of resources, wealth, and power, studied in economics, often correlates with societal structures studied in sociology. The interplay between these fields provides a comprehensive understanding of how social and economic factors jointly influence human societies, offering insights into the complex dynamics that shape our collective existence.
26/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: 4.Institutions play a pivotal role in shaping and organizing societal structures, providing a framework for human interactions and behaviors. These can include formal entities like governments, legal systems, and educational institutions, as well as informal structures like family and cultural traditions.

Positive functions include maintaining social order, facilitating cooperation, and ensuring the smooth functioning of societies. Examples include legal systems that uphold justice and contracts, education institutions fostering knowledge, and healthcare systems promoting public well-being.

However, institutions can also be scrutinized for perpetuating power imbalances. Economic institutions, like financial systems, may favor the wealthy, reinforcing inequality. Political institutions may be accused of serving the interests of elites rather than the broader population. For instance, critiques of government structures often center on their potential to cater to powerful interests.

In essence, institutions have the capacity for both positive societal functions and reinforcing power dynamics. The assessment depends on how well they address the needs of the entire population and whether they contribute to or mitigate social inequalities.
26/1/24, 12:09 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: 5.Primary and secondary groups are two sociological concepts that describe different types of social relationships.

Primary groups are characterized by close, intimate, and personal relationships. These connections often involve deep emotional bonds, frequent face-to-face interactions, and a sense of belonging. Family, close friends, and small social circles are typical examples of primary groups.

In-Groups and Out-Groups in Primary Groups:

Within primary groups, in-groups are those to which individuals feel a sense of loyalty and belonging, while out-groups are perceived as outsiders. For example, within a close-knit family, family members constitute the in-group, while outsiders may be considered the out-group.

Secondary Groups
   
Secondary groups are more formal, larger, and often task-oriented. Relationships in secondary groups are typically less personal and more focused on achieving specific objectives. Workplaces, classrooms, and large organizations are common examples of secondary groups.

In-Groups and Out-Groups in Secondary Groups

 In secondary groups, in-groups and out-groups can emerge based on shared interests or affiliations. For instance, within a workplace, colleagues working on a project may form an in-group, while those not involved may be perceived as part of the out-group.

In summary, primary groups involve close personal ties, while secondary groups are more formal and task-oriented. In-groups and out-groups can manifest in both primary and secondary groups, influencing social dynamics and relationships within these social structures.

26/1/24, 12:43 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Hope you are good today
26/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for the academic interview question, May I kindly know if you have completed the SOP form as well?
26/1/24, 12:43 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I have completed it
26/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 1:19 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Indeed
26/1/24, 1:19 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
26/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
26/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 1:25 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
26/1/24, 1:25 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: That is accurate
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/1/24, 1:33 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Right
26/1/24, 1:33 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: The university registration fee isn't the 500-1000 that was mentioned yesterday?
26/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/1/24, 1:37 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Correct
26/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 1:42 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: In the first sessions I was told the scholarship covers for food ,accommodation and fees and all we have to do is pay for the remaining fees
26/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely right dear. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
26/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/1/24, 1:46 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
26/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/1/24, 1:52 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
26/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/1/24, 10:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alice, I hope you are doing well!
27/1/24, 10:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
27/1/24, 11:09 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: Indeed
27/1/24, 11:11 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265989911912, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 11:14 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: Everything sums up to $2800 or lesser depending on the scholarship
27/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely correct, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/1/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 11:16 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: Wonderful
27/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/1/24, 11:17 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: I am
27/1/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/1/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
27/1/24, 11:20 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: What is the solution
27/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/1/24, 11:22 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/1/24, 11:23 AM - +265 989 91 19 12: Following
27/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 12:04 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand
27/1/24, 12:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/1/24, 12:06 PM - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm excited
27/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
