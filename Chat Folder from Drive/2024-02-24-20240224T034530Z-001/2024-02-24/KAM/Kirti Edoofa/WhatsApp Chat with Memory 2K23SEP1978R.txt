19/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Memory

I trust this message finds you well. I was going through our conversation the past couple of days and noticed that we have experienced recent challenges in connecting with each other as per our availability and hence there has been a delay in addressing the concerns you shared the other day.
19/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To ensure the same is addressed as early as possible and to ensure a smoother interaction, I wanted to reach out and schedule a discussion today to address the financial concerns you have expressed. Hence, could you please share your availability today from 01:00 pm to 07:00 pm, I will do my best to accommodate our conversation accordingly.
19/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 339 0549: Good day. I am available now.
19/12/23, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us @263773390549. With this, I want to know what are you plans for the remaining fees, could you please share them with us?
19/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 77 339 0549: I thought the plan was shared and agreed upon already. All the same the plan was monthly installments of $150 until the figure is cleared. I thought that was the standing payment plan.
19/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773390549 I truly understand your thoughts, and I am here to help you understand the current updates that we have received from the university. As we shared earlier the the Endowment Benefits are closing this year, however on our request the university has extended the benefits until February giving you extra time to clear the remaining amount.
19/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, as you are willing to make a payment of $150 every month. In this situation, I would like to share that you can plan your finances as you have enough time to clear this remaining amount. Let me share the example for better understanding,
19/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You can make a payment of 160 by December and 180 by January and remaining amount of $249 by February. In short, all you have to do is to align your preparations so that the remaining balance of $589 can be completed before the end of February, you can plan to pay this amount according to your finances every month. You have three good months available for this balance fee. I hope you get some clarity here.
19/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 77 339 0549: It's ok will try that if there is no other way out.
19/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 77 339 0549: My other question is on possibility of a refund. Is that a possibility
19/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773390549 , I did not get you well regarding the query you shared for the refund? Your application for a scholarship has already been processed after which you were able to secure your scholarship seat and hold the same till you complete your remaining formalities and hence it is non refundable as per the procedures. May I know what happened because of which you had the same query?
19/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 77 339 0549: I wanted to understand what will happen in case I fail to meet the registration payment deadline. Chances that such a scenario can happen are there. So I wanted to know what then will happen to the payments I have already done. Will I get a refund or will be given more time.
19/12/23, 9:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand from where you are coming @263773390549, these questions are common when you have such challenges. I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
19/12/23, 9:44 PM - +263 77 339 0549: It's ok

I trust this message finds you in good health. In our recent conversation, you mentioned that you were able to raise $100 towards the monthly installment for your university registration fee, and I shared this update with the university officials as well.
29/12/23, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As the due date of December 30th is just around the corner, I am confident that you are putting in all your efforts to raise the remaining $100 towards the fee. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and inquire about how your preparation has been progressing. 

Have you been successful in raising the balance amount, and have you decided on the date when you are planning to make the deposit? Your timely response will help us ensure a smooth process, and I am here to assist you with any further guidance or support you may need.

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 339 0549: I am sorry Ashi. There could be a mix up. Memory Chokuda has already been offered a scholarship and we are busy processing registration payment.
16/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes you are right that you are in process of the registration process. Although I would like you to share the A level results please.

16/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 339 0549: <Media omitted>

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
