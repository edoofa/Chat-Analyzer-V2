19/12/23, 7:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, he can catch up to us anytime soon. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/12/23, 7:57 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/12/23, 8:00 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Great
19/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/12/23, 8:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

27/12/23, 8:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 8:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 8:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 8:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 8:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 8:21 PM - +263 71 962 7232: Yes sir i do agree
27/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
27/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?

To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 12:17 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I think my son solomon is the one with that data of information.i will call him after school and remind him to be on section with correct information man..
29/1/24, 12:18 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Verry sorry if i d8sapointing you please
29/1/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is quite alright sir. In the meantime, if you are ready, we can proceed with further discussion. May I know if you are available for the same?
29/1/24, 1:18 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes we can continue
29/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 2:35 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thats a true fact
29/1/24, 2:43 PM - +27 74 676 1601: For that isue of my    children's education im verry commited and dadicate my self on that.i rather safer bt make sure that my kids got adquet education
29/1/24, 2:46 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thank you a lot Ms Siddihi Singh.i apreciate for that schedule
29/1/24, 2:47 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I can see that i had a delayed response its becouse of signal Ms
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is quite alright sir, I understand that you are facing network challenges.
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 3:13 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I thank you so much with these essential advises.they are verry verry important so that i will not face any disappointments to my son and famliy also
29/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - +27 74 676 1601: You are welcome my dear.what ever help you think its necessary for you are welcome
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I thank you so mch   mam
29/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
29/1/24, 4:39 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Best idia.100 % agree
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
29/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
29/1/24, 5:44 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Wooow i can see.evrything will be easy honestly
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 6:32 PM - +27 74 676 1601: You are wellcome.May God bless your day please.have a good one.
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon. I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:11 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Verry sorry the site i was working today dosent us to have our phones with us at all.We left them in a lock room
30/1/24, 4:11 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Me and my family we are so good
30/1/24, 4:12 PM - +27 74 676 1601: We thank God for life given.how about you?
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well, sir. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our last conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's conversation, I want to let you know there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
30/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
30/1/24, 5:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
30/1/24, 7:32 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes i understand that.also sunce the economy of zimbabwe is not stable.Things can change overnoght.so things need to be disided wisely
31/1/24, 6:32 AM - +263 71 962 7232: Yes sir it is accurate
31/1/24, 6:32 AM - +263 71 962 7232: Verry sorry for late response i was out of whatsapp bundle
31/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Im verry well as well as my family.how are you also we wish you the best day ever today.
31/1/24, 2:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our previous interaction, we were discussing the details of the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, considering the constraints that we previously discussed, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
31/1/24, 2:52 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes.im eveready for your explanation
31/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
31/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
31/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 962 7232: Afternoon sir
31/1/24, 4:18 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes it will be a good idia
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
31/1/24, 5:50 PM - +27 74 676 1601: All of your advises and all position which Edoofa will take are awesome.i eill follow that
31/1/24, 7:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 7:37 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thank you a lot.same to you have a wonderfull night
1/2/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon. I hope you are doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 71 962 7232: Afternoon sir
1/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope your day is going well. Since our operational hours have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I hope that you will be available during the 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM slot that we have scheduled for our session.

I wish you a blessed night!
1/2/24, 5:38 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Im fine and all of my family as well.
1/2/24, 5:38 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Hope you are doing well
1/2/24, 5:39 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I understand that.no problame we will chart tomorrow
2/2/24, 2:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - +27 74 676 1601: We are all fine.thank yu for checking on us
2/2/24, 3:16 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Hope you doing good as well
2/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well, thank you for asking. We were discussing the Financial Secure Plan during our previous interaction. Allow me to proceed with the same.
2/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/2/24, 4:24 PM - +27 74 676 1601: You can go ahead
2/2/24, 4:28 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes
2/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
2/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
2/2/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
2/2/24, 5:15 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thats best..i will wait for that day yu are going to help me.i like it
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thank you for best advise a great help to assist us
2/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
2/2/24, 5:52 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yes i understand it thats gud.i will do that
2/2/24, 7:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/2/24, 9:08 PM - +27 74 676 1601: We are going to discuss this weekend
3/2/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Solomon. How are you all doing this fine morning?

6/2/24, 1:49 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Ok
6/2/24, 1:50 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yu can go trough it so that i can nkow more about it
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Solomon too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

6/2/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you can very clearly understand the motivation behind conducting such events for our students. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Solomon

I hope this message finds you well and filled with the same excitement that's buzzing here at Edoofa! It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Solomon EWYL23E0977*, adding both you and your parents to the mix. If I have missed including any other family members, they can easily join using the following link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/FGFTl7T4Y9659SdHFAqclR].

Within the group, the EWYL team will not only guide you on the hows and whens of the EWYL Program but also share all the exciting details about the upcoming Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. We are genuinely thrilled to witness you embark on this transformative journey, and we are rooting for your success every step of the way!

Warmest regards,
Admissions Team.

I hope you are all doing great today. You can add anyone who is part of contributing towards your higher education journey Solomon. Could you kindly let me know who you wish to add to the group?
8/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page here and that you understand the constraints and challenges that we have kept in mind while curating the Financial Secure Plan. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
8/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
8/2/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
8/2/24, 9:08 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Thank you so much.i hope you had a wonderfull day today all of you in this group

8/2/24, 9:33 PM - +263 71 962 7232: A sibling
9/2/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon.

I hope you are all having a wonderful day. Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the Financial Secure Plan. I understand that since you have other finances to attend to this month, you will be able to begin the Financial Secure Plan from the month of March. In such a case, could you kindly let me know of a preferable date when you would like to make your monthly deposits?
9/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Your sibling can join your EWYL group as well. May I know if they are currently studying or are they employed?
9/2/24, 1:27 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Ok thank you so much for your understanding
9/2/24, 1:27 PM - +27 74 676 1601: How are you today and how is your day today.mine it is so great

9/2/24, 1:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that your day is going great. Everything is well on my end too, thank you for asking.

Thank you for letting me know that. Solomon's sister can most definitely join the group and you may share the link with her so that she is able to join.
9/2/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome sir. In such a case, may I know if you were able to decide on a monthly deposit date from the month of March onwards?
9/2/24, 1:56 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Im not quet sure of the date becouse it depends on which date we got salarry.we dont have a fixed date for salarry
9/2/24, 1:57 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Bt i want to ask is this acount be openned in zimbabwe or  India
9/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you do not have a fixed date for your salary. In such a case, may I know if it is suitable for you if we choose a date in the 2nd week of every month. This way, regardless of whether you receive your salary by month-end or during the first week of every month, you will be able to make the payments on time.

The deadlines are set to designate a final payment date. You have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline.
9/2/24, 2:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The account that you need to open under Solomon's name will be done in your country itself i.e., Zimbabwe.
9/2/24, 3:09 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I think its still to far to mension the date sinse i said end of march or Aprill.the reason is i dont want to give you falls information
9/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, and I appreciate your honesty regarding the matter. Given the uncertainty surrounding your payment schedule, would it be suitable for you to commence the plan from the end of April?

Our objective is to ensure that by November, we can save $1500 for Solomon's higher education. In this scenario, if you could contribute an additional amount every month, you would be able to cover the first two months of the plan, namely February and March. This approach would help us stay on track to meet our savings goal.

12/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Solomon.

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. I had hoped to hear back from you on Saturday but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end. If there's anything you need assistance with or any questions you have, please don't hesitate to let me know.

12/2/24, 3:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Since our last discussion was on Friday, may I know if you were able to further discuss about the Financial Secure Plan?

I understand that since you are unsure about when you will be receiving your salary, to be on the safer side, I suggested the end of month or the first week of the month. Could you kindly let me know if any of these are suitable for you?
12/2/24, 3:56 PM - +27 74 676 1601: Yu nkow what i dont want to disapoint you mostly
12/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I completely understand, sir. However, it's crucial to finalize a date as we need it for legal purposes to draft an agreement, which will then be shared with you. You mentioned that there's no fixed date for you to receive your salary. Would you be able to provide an approximate timeframe when it usually arrives? Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
12/2/24, 4:09 PM - +27 74 676 1601: If i give yu a date and fail on that it i think i will fill so bad.also i think yu wasent here proper what i said if i said i will start march or April it means end of march upwords becouse end feb is  February  salary not march also this way of banking i used save money for my kids education  in my accounts here in southafrica .the reason is i opened many acounts in zimbabwe bt due to inflation you can work up tomorrow the government of zimbabwe telling yu a new storry.1..the bank can tell you that they dont have at money at all.2..the money you can even not get it at all..Now by this isue of opening an acount im just doing it not to disapoint you becouse to be honest yourself its difcult for you to understand my storry bt its true

12/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. Thank you for letting me know that. The deadlines are set to designate a final payment date. You have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline.
12/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, may I know if you will be comfortable with the 5th of every month starting from April till January 2025 to make your monthly deposits? <This message was edited>

13/2/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Solomon,

I hope you are doing great. I understand please, if the 10th of every month is suitable for you, that can be our monthly deposit date.
13/2/24, 9:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The deadlines are set to designate a final payment date. You have the flexibility to make the payment anytime between the previous and the upcoming deadline. If, for any reason, you are unable to make the payment before the deadline due to insufficient funds, I kindly request you to inform us about the same beforehand so that we can work together to find a solution. <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100. However, in such a case, I urge you to kindly inform us before hand so that we are on the same page and there is no confusion.
13/2/24, 6:46 PM - +27 74 676 1601: I understand.thank you so much
