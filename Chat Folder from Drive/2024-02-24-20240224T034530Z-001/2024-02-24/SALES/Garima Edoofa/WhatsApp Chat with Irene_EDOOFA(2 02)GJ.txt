However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

13/02/24, 12:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Due to the increase competition in global job marketing international experience can be a valuable asset, opportunity to experience a new culture and learn about the world in a way which is different from my country. Also as a way to improve language skills and gain global perspective on my field
13/02/24, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

13/02/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Shantel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
13/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 316 3939: And I trust this program that it will provide me with conducive environment and I'm willing to study with my utmost dedication
13/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Yes im aware.

Yes it is
13/02/24, 5:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the same so that you have a better clarity of the same.
13/02/24, 5:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/02/24, 5:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 5:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: So. don't you think it is affordable for your family?
13/02/24, 6:20 pm - +263 71 316 3939: This message was deleted
13/02/24, 6:21 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Interesting
13/02/24, 6:22 pm - +263 71 316 3939: It is affordable but I have a question will I be pay my tuition fee etc or the scholarship will assist
13/02/24, 9:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/02/24, 9:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response as I was occupied in a meeting.
13/02/24, 9:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you that I will not be available tomorrow due to some family emergency that needs my immediate attention, In that case, we will be connecting on 15th February.

God Bless!
Good Night.
13/02/24, 10:06 pm - +263 71 316 3939: It's ok have a nice day tomorrow
15/02/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 316 3939: Good morning mam hope you had a wonderful day yesterday

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
16/02/24, 7:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in my response, As there was some family emergency that needed my immediate attention.
16/02/24, 8:12 am - +263 71 316 3939: Good morning to you too.

Yes we may start
16/02/24, 8:12 am - +263 71 316 3939: It's ok
16/02/24, 8:31 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Shantel what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/02/24, 8:31 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
16/02/24, 9:02 am - +263 71 316 3939: It's fine. Really it's ok
16/02/24, 9:02 am - Garima Edoofa: So, Shall I brief you about the Earn while you learn Program?
16/02/24, 9:03 am - +263 71 316 3939: Yes may you
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
16/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 71 316 3939: I guess it will be
16/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 316 3939: It is indeed it is
16/02/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/02/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 316 3939: Honestly I liked them all
16/02/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright @263713163939 , basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Yes they are willing to support me
16/02/24, 1:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263713163939 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Right I'm kinder of busy I'm at school
16/02/24, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know at what time will you be available for the session?
16/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Half 2
16/02/24, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to tell you that my working hours are from 9 AM to 4:30 PM CAT, But considering your situation I will stretch my working hours.
16/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 316 3939: It's ok now I'm free
16/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 316 3939: May we start
16/02/24, 2:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
16/02/24, 2:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shantel as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 316 3939: 1 500 to 2000
16/02/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/02/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/02/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
16/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Its good honestly.
16/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 316 3939: So I have to pay 350 application fee
16/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 316 3939: By 29 February
16/02/24, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263713163939 tentative shares will be shared with you soon, please.
16/02/24, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/02/24, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shantel basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/02/24, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Right now I'm preparing for my A level. Does it mean I will be earning while I learn now or after the exams
16/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: After you enroll with Edoofa, moving forward the admission team will guide you about the same.
16/02/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood till here?
16/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Yes I did
16/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 316 3939: OK I understand
16/02/24, 2:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Irene, as we have discussed the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
16/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 316 3939: But paying $200 in 13 days is alot
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 316 3939: You said phase one their will be a counsellings session and if the student is found eligible they will pay $350 in 7days but due to economic hardship in Africa thre is room for part payment wre application can be paid 200 in the first 7 days and the rest in 30day.also the earn while you learn after the phase of counseling and and application fee
16/02/24, 3:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
16/02/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now it is clear?
16/02/24, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand that raising $200 in the given time frame can be a challenge, but despite the challenges, some so many students and parents are paying the Enrollment Fees, so that they can reserve seat for their child.

16/02/24, 3:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Shantel and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
16/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 71 316 3939: Yes I have
16/02/24, 3:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 3:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/02/24, 3:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/02/24, 8:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263772703489 @263713163939 @263712259927 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
17/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 71 316 3939: Yes we may
17/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 71 316 3939: Good morning to you too
17/02/24, 10:01 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood till here?
17/02/24, 10:05 am - +263 71 316 3939: Yes I did
17/02/24, 10:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
17/02/24, 10:07 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/02/24, 10:07 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
17/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 71 316 3939: So after application fee of 350. I have to pay 500 to 1000 registration fee
17/02/24, 10:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
17/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 316 3939: I understand now
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: Do connect with Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well.
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
17/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

Are you clear about the same?
