I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your  every term fee, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do (Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Im Blessing Patsika, born on 1 May 2005, this you know.I'm the Headboy at Speciss College, Highfield Harare. I'm an Upper 6 student doing MPC(Pure mathematics, physics and chemistry), hoping to do civil engineering. 
My school fee is $300 per term. 
Along with what I want to study, my strength concerning my attitude is that if I start something, I'm determined to finish. Usually l don't give up on something, unless the bridge isn't firm, it's better to fail rather than quiting and also my weakness is that if l quite something, I'll never attempt to try it again. And then Academically, l love physics more than Chemistry though at first it was a little bit difficult. I'm good in mathematics.

I like singing very much, infact I'm a song writer (gospel songs cause lm a Christian). I'm also musician l can play a keyboard, drums and guiter. But I'm based in playing lead guiter

I'm from a family of 3.I live with both of my parent, my dad being a driver at a construction company (Rosam Builders) and my mom a is self employed person. She has a small tuck shop having brains and some cosmetics.
Both my parents have no any educational qualifications. My dad left school around the age of 12 because of the death of parents. My mother aslo left school at grade seven because of the death of her father. They lived a tough life. 
I've a brother after me in form 4, turning 17 on 6 Oct and the last born is a girl turning 6 on 22 March. My mother is pregnant so very soon we'll four.

10/02/24, 8:35 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
10/02/24, 9:25 am - +263 71 847 4679: Morning Ms Garima, we can start
10/02/24, 10:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright! So going through your results which you've shared, I would recommend a course for you by analysis of your hobbies passion and career inclination and my expertise so the course is
 *B.Tech Civil Engineering*
So may I know does this course aligns you and May I know if you've managed to do any research about this course, please?
10/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 847 4679: I did some research on this course
10/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 847 4679: I think this course aligns me
10/02/24, 10:44 am - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the course?
10/02/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 847 4679: Yes you can
10/02/24, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
10/02/24, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the course and understand it and inform me once it is done.
10/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 847 4679: I'm done now
10/02/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if this course aligns with you?
10/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Yes it does
10/02/24, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
10/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 847 4679: In five years, I hope to have built on my skills and gained more responsibility within this field. I’m eager to learn from experienced team members and eventually take on leadership roles.
The Edoofa's Program will help me having ideas like what you've done, providing more information and knowledge on my course. The program also helps in the sponsorship
10/02/24, 3:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, @263718474679 

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
10/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Yes I'm willing
10/02/24, 3:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 847 4679: This is because of our country's economy status and job opportunities.l was also looking for sponsorship.
10/02/24, 3:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you that since my working hours our over for today which is 9:00 AM CAT - 1:30 PM CAT I will connect with you *on Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. 

Have a great weekend ahead!
God Bless You!
10/02/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Thank you Ms Garima, God bless you
12/02/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
12/02/24, 9:10 am - +263 71 847 4679: Morning Ms Garima, we can start
12/02/24, 9:36 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
12/02/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you are aware that Edoofa is a scholarship program and not a sponsorship?
12/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 71 847 4679: I'm aware
12/02/24, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
12/02/24, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
12/02/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 847 4679: I think it would help in strengthening the technical and vocational education and training skills, capacity development of teachers in science. In Zimbabwe, we're usually based on theory not having practical life. <This message was edited>
12/02/24, 10:04 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Blessing, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
12/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 847 4679: I do agree
12/02/24, 10:13 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
12/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 71 847 4679: That's true

12/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 847 4679: 1). Having studied in India implement a positive impact on my career. India is regarded as one of the best countries with great, multiple Universities and Colleges. Having a degree from India will make me more recognized by the other countries, making it much easier to get job opportunities in any countries. 

2). I aim to have good working,and motivating environment which will enable me to stay focused. I'm now fully confident enough that if l get to study in India I'll achieve my carrier aspirations, by having good quality of education from qualified lecturers, teachers.
12/02/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Blessing. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
12/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Without a scholarship it is difficult
12/02/24, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/02/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 1:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
12/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 847 4679: For my family it's kinda a challenge
12/02/24, 4:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Blessing, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/02/24, 4:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
12/02/24, 10:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
13/02/24, 8:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
13/02/24, 9:27 am - +263 71 847 4679: We can start
13/02/24, 9:28 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
13/02/24, 9:29 am - +263 71 847 4679: I think it will be fine as I’ll be earning while I’m learning
13/02/24, 9:33 am - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 847 4679: Yes, you can
13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

Good Night.
13/02/24, 9:42 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Good night Ms Garima
13/02/24, 9:42 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Noted
16/02/24, 8:04 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
16/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 847 4679: Yes it can
16/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 847 4679: We can start
16/02/24, 12:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright.
16/02/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/02/24, 12:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/02/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/02/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/02/24, 8:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
17/02/24, 9:14 am - +263 71 847 4679: Morning Ms Garima, we can
17/02/24, 10:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
17/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 847 4679: The fourth point
17/02/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright @263718474679 , basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
17/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 847 4679: Yes they are the ones
17/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright  @263718474679 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
17/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 71 847 4679: Im ready
17/02/24, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Blessing as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 71 847 4679: $1500-$2250
17/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/02/24, 11:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
17/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 71 847 4679: I do
17/02/24, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/02/24, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Blessing basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.* <This message was edited>
17/02/24, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 847 4679: I understand
17/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 847 4679: I would like you to to give a brief light on the ETSE
17/02/24, 12:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what exactly you mean by that, can you please elaborate.
17/02/24, 12:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Blessing as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
17/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 71 847 4679: Sorry typing error

22/02/24, 8:20 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787783691 @263772341803 @263718474679 , Hope you are doing well.


I apologize for the delay in my reply. I was attending to a family emergency as my grandfather had passed away, which required my immediate attention.
22/02/24, 8:39 am - +263 71 847 4679: It’s alright, how are you Ms Garima
22/02/24, 8:42 am - Garima Edoofa: I am good, please.
22/02/24, 8:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
22/02/24, 9:00 am - +263 71 847 4679: A student has to pay $350,seat reservation fee and after (enrollment fee ), which includes assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple universities application and visa assistance with EWYL. This fee is supposed to be paid in 7 days, but a student might face challenges in this span of days so $200 can be paid and the remaining $150 within next 30 days. University application costs about $1500-$2250, so Edoofa helps parent by paying only $750.
22/02/24, 9:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/02/24, 9:02 am - Garima Edoofa: I  hope now it is clear?
22/02/24, 9:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes Blessing and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
22/02/24, 9:05 am - +263 71 847 4679: Now l understand
Thank you <This message was edited>

22/02/24, 9:06 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 9:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/02/24, 9:07 am - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/02/24, 9:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/02/24, 9:08 am - +263 71 847 4679: Yes you can
22/02/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
22/02/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 9:09 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
22/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 71 847 4679: I’m clear now
22/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 71 847 4679: I’ve no questions by now
22/02/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/02/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/02/24, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well, please
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
