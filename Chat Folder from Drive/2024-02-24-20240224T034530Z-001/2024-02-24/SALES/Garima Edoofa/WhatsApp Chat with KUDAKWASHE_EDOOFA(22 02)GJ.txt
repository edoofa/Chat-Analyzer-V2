23/02/24, 10:01 am - ~ ~Ⓜ️🅰️STE®️**Ⓜ️IND~😎🔥✌🏻 added +263 77 352 2592
23/02/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 352 2592: Good morning.  Please explain what this is all about
23/02/24, 10:09 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on what you exactly mean by fully funded scholarship?
23/02/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 019 8320: A scholarship whereby you will responsible for all the costs
23/02/24, 10:15 am - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
23/02/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
23/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 019 8320: Oky l understand
23/02/24, 10:45 am - Garima Edoofa: So, @263780198320 can you please tell me whether Edoofa is a scholarship program or a Sponsorship?
23/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 019 8320: From my own understanding, it's a scholarship program
23/02/24, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, correct.
23/02/24, 11:08 am - Garima Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Providence!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what did you happen to learn from your friend?
23/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 019 8320: Yes, about Edoofa l know that it's a scholarship program that makes it more  easier for students to achieve their tertiary education, my friend applied also for this program and l had to research about it that's how l got to know about it
23/02/24, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: I see you have partial knowledge of the program, let me help you have a better understanding of the same.
