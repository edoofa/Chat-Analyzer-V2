08/02/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 697 0260: I have done my research and the course is broad  from my understanding it involves algorthms  ,programming ,networking,computer  software and hardware  and ine has to be good in maths .l liked this course as it provides a wide range of career prospects and it will show me my strengths  and what l  good at it if its web developing or programming and so forth .Eventually l will be able to understand  the world of technology abd its relation with businesses
08/02/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 697 0260: All l am saying is l am willing to learn more take up challenges  and see where it ends and invest my time and hardwork
08/02/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that you are willing to work hard.
08/02/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 697 0260: Thank you maam

08/02/24, 9:35 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?
And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/02/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 697 0260: If l get into Edoofas program  l will be able to reduce the expanses rhat my family would have  incurred here in Zimbabwe as the fees and accomodation and tuition  are quite high but l have heard that  Edoofa   is aimed to provide education to all  and the fees are  understandable .Edoofa saves to create an opportunity to interact with successful people who have made it in  the computer science field and  that serves as a great motivator .India is amongst the top countries that  are the best to study  Computer applications and  has internationally recognised  university and scholarship like Edoofa  thus that can pave way for me to work in renowned industries .Edoofa provides me with mentors that will help me to have focus l believe and  l can  engage in  industrial visits which is quite helpful as one can learn the pressure the  need for teamwork  in that field of study.
My vision in  5 years after study is  l want to be someone who motivates   people and is an inspiration to engage in  this field cause l hope to be an asset to the organisation l will be working for .l hope to be  a donor for some children  who  cannot afford  their fees.If opportunity arises and l do work in India  l would like to  be brand ambassador for an organisation like EDOOFA which gives hope to students that they can achieve their dreams and be someone great too. I hope to  open an innovation hub in Zimbabwe  where l live precisely so that  in the end   other children can get a better understanding of this program  and engage in it and be able to put Zimbabwe on the map   too .l also hope to  be able to have built  my mother  a house  and engage in various activities to the community l grew up in and the community which mentored me  to achieve what l would have achieved.
08/02/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Tanatswa.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear? <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 697 0260: My family andlife has taught me that nothing comes easy in life  you have to work hard and shed some sweat to achieve something great  so yes maam l am willing  to work very very hard   and give my 200%  and grab every opportunity that comes my way with open hands
08/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 697 0260: Grab every opportunity with both arms
08/02/24, 10:10 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 697 0260: When l did my research  l  found out that the cost for  the universities in Zimbabwe are around $2500  that is just the fees not including accomodation  and fees and transport  which may range close to $216 per month  depending on the university  and where  you live and that is quite restraining with my mother being in her 50s and her  health deteriorating  l am hoping to  find a scholarship that can fund my education and has a stable economy so that l can ease her mind and she can take some rest .Zimbabwe is currently facing inflation so one day you have money the next you have none so l am hoping to  find somewhere that is  better as compared to  my country and more stable.Zimbabwe is a developing country and around 2500 students graduate a year at UZ  alone  and they are looking for jobs and the level of unemployment is quite high  ,l for one dont want to graduate  and eventually stay home because of lack of employment. I am opting to study abroad and eventually start work abroad so as to know the principles other countries have so that if things go well l can start a business with the knowledge and experience  l would have acquired  from various aspects of life  and reduce the unemployment in my country.  My understanding is that at this moment in time studying abroad   serves to provide more opportunities than my country
08/02/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 697 0260: I hope to save as an inspiration  to my  cousins  and community so that they see that there are more opportunites  than  just medicine and law and that they can engage in other programs like what l would have  done  and they can choose from variius course and programs.l hope to   start an organisation or be a donor to pay for someone fees .l  for one lacked career guidance at some point so l would like to engage in activities or sessions that enlighten one on   the career paths they can choose from.l hope to start an innovation hub  where youngsters could share ideas so as to reduce  shenanigan behaviour like prostitution  and the consumption of illegal drugs
08/02/24, 10:46 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Tanatswa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 697 0260: I agree and l am willing to learn
08/02/24, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 697 0260: That is what  l hope to achieve and l know that  things start small andget big l am willing to try and see how it ends

08/02/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 697 0260: I have understood clearly
08/02/24, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Tanatswa, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
08/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 697 0260: The program l require to do requires patience and calmness   and mental focus which l can  get through yoga and the culture of meditation.I  am able to be part of cutting edge research and inovation opportunities which can  help tackle  environmental problens like disease detection and  pollution through the use of computers.

I hope to interact well ad ask questions to my mentors on issues l would like clarity on.Cultural diversity serves to give me an ppportunity to better ubderstand peoples views
08/02/24, 11:30 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tanatswa. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
08/02/24, 11:33 am - +263 77 697 0260: We have a vague idea that it ranges from $8000 to $9000  without scholarship and around $2000 to $3000  with a scholarship
08/02/24, 11:35 am - Garima Edoofa: Shall I explain you in brief, so that you can have better clarity on the same.
08/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 697 0260: Yes please
08/02/24, 11:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/02/24, 11:37 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:37 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
08/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 697 0260: Give me a moment  ro discuss
08/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 697 0260: Its still too much for them    with the earn while you learn cant it get lower
08/02/24, 12:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tanatswa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Ohk let me enlighten my family and get back to you
08/02/24, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
08/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Please do so
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
08/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 697 0260: I think that the earn while you learn is unique and an effective way of exposure  as it  can entails of the experience of others  their challenges and how they overcame them . I very much think that this will be beneficial for me
08/02/24, 1:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 1:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
08/02/24, 1:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
08/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Earn while you learn
08/02/24, 1:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Tanatswa, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Yes they will try their best
08/02/24, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Tanatswa, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/02/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Yes l am
08/02/24, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanatswa as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Around $1500 to$2 250
08/02/24, 2:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
08/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Wthis is reasonable
08/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 697 0260: That is helpful
08/02/24, 2:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/02/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanatswa basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/02/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Ohk
08/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 697 0260: So l will talk with my parents again about Edoofa
08/02/24, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanatswa, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
08/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 77 697 0260: I have understood that Edoofa is unique as you get a guaranteed scholarship and admision into a university at an affordable  fee of $350  for the reservation letter ,$200 in a period of 7 days and $150 in  30 days which gives the students family to gather the money if the student does not meet the necessary requirements for the scholarship the parents get their 350 refunded. EWYL is aimed to reduce  the fee  before results are out
08/02/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
08/02/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you have understood it better?
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Tanatswa and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 697 0260: I have understood
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Yes l have
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/02/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Yes l do
08/02/24, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
08/02/24, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/02/24, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
08/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 697 0260: Ohk
08/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 697 0260: For now l am fine l will just have to discuss this with my whole family  and get them on board
08/02/24, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/02/24, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
10/02/24, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: In the mean time can you please answer these questions.
10/02/24, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

10/02/24, 11:34 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to correct the name of the course, please.

10/02/24, 11:35 am - Garima Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
10/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 697 0260: Yes they are
10/02/24, 11:36 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want your parents to acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note.
10/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 697 0260: Ok let me tell them
10/02/24, 11:44 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
10/02/24, 11:44 am - Garima Edoofa: I waiting for your response.
10/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 239 5229: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
10/02/24, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
10/02/24, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
10/02/24, 11:51 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th February  2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
10/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 239 5229: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, from my understanding you mean that by the end of the month you can pay the $200?
10/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 239 5229: I can say by the 5th of March, i might have $200. I am starting to look around from friends.
10/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you exactly facing, so that I can assist you better?
10/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 239 5229: The challenge is i earn $250. Tanatswa had mentioned all the benefits of Edoofa including EWYL programme but to be honest it will be too much for us.
10/02/24, 2:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you that since my working hours our over for today which is 9:00 AM CAT - 1:30 PM CAT I will connect with you *on Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. 

Have a great weekend ahead!

12/02/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: According to the information provided in the preceding voice note, it was stated that payment is received after each month. Could you please confirm if my interpretation is accurate?
12/02/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 239 5229: Good morning Mrs Garima the thing is my pay is $250  and  we cant make ends meet with this.l was so happy when my sister mentioned Edoofa and what could mean for her what she could achieve  and soforth the earn while you learn program and told her l would support her she mentioned the fees and l was heartbroken on what to tell her she has always been ambitious and hoped for a scholarship to further her studies  but the money seems too much for us but l didnt have the courage to tell her at first but now l dont want her to build hope and have it shattered because maybe we wouldnt have the money for the flight ticket .I hope you understand that this is what l really want for her and what she wants but  l just dont think that  l can make ends meet if there is another way please enlighten me on one and maybe we could try
13/02/24, 8:46 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263776970260 @263772395229 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
13/02/24, 8:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Due to some technical issues, I couldn't respond to your text, I hope you understand, please.
13/02/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 697 0260: Good morning
13/02/24, 8:51 am - +263 77 697 0260: Ok
13/02/24, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand your concern, please.

Talking about the Enrollment Fees, I will talk to the Academic Board specifically about your application so that the Board can provide you with a flexible payment plan. 

If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not visa fees or flight tickets because the visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe twice or once, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.

13/02/24, 12:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: did discuss Tanatswa’s application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider tanatswa's Application if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by the next 21 days, and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in the next 30 days. All in all, for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient for you and your family, isn't it?

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Tanatswa over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know.
23/02/24, 9:26 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 697 0260: 👏🏽👏🏽thank you
23/02/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through the Acceptance Letter properly, and once done let me know.
23/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 77 697 0260: Ohk
23/02/24, 9:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
23/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 697 0260: I have gone through it
23/02/24, 10:30 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, may I know if you want to ask any questions about the Acceptance Letter?
23/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 697 0260: As of now l dont thank you
23/02/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright please, however since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 697 0260: I cannot get through to my sister at the moment so l am not aware of which one she will opt for
23/02/24, 10:35 am - Garima Edoofa: In that case, shall I brief you about both modes of payment?
23/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 697 0260: Yes thar would be fine
23/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
23/02/24, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: @263776970260 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
23/02/24, 10:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828
