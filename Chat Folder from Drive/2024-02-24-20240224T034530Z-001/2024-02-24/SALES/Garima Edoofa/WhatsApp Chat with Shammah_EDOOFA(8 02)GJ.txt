God Bless!
Good Night.
14/02/24, 6:58 am - +263 78 046 6316: Ok, noted. Thank you and be blessed too.
16/02/24, 8:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263774097745 @263780466316 @263784489730, Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
16/02/24, 9:17 am - +263 78 046 6316: Morning how are you. Lets go ahead
16/02/24, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
16/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 046 6316: Yes l do
16/02/24, 10:28 am - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @263780466316 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
16/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 046 6316: Yes l am aware, thats why l am in need of this program.
16/02/24, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/02/24, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
16/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 046 6316: Truely speaking we can't afford it because  my monthly wages is just a hand to mouth situation. That's why l choose a Earn while you Learn scholarship.
16/02/24, 11:47 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263780466316 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/02/24, 11:48 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
16/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 046 6316: It's a good idea, l like it.
16/02/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yes pease
16/02/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/02/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/02/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/02/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/02/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
16/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 046 6316: The Edoofians have more chances of excelling in future over other graduates. Yes we will benefits us
16/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 046 6316: .... benefit from it.
16/02/24, 2:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/02/24, 2:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yaah, surely, that is what l am aiming for.
16/02/24, 3:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/02/24, 3:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Point # 4. Higher Education Concierge. It covers student's needs.
16/02/24, 3:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright @263780466316 , basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you as a family member would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
16/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Thank you so much with your time. Now l am looking forward to hear from you in your earliest time.
16/02/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263780466316 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yes am ready for that.
16/02/24, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263780466316 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 046 6316: The cost l will go up to between $1 500 to $2 500
16/02/24, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/02/24, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/02/24, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
16/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Ok Garima , l heard. I have to discuss this with family members. But l still have a challenge with money (application fee cost). This gonna be the stumbling block. Situation here is no conjucive.
16/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 046 6316: .... conducive.
16/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yes l believe you.
16/02/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing?
16/02/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/02/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263780466316 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/02/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/02/24, 8:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
16/02/24, 9:18 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Garima, l am a working class here and with hardships we are facing, Can you imagine, l am  earning as little as USA $100. I need rent and rates, food for the family, transport just to mention a few. So my worry is how can l raise $350 before cut off date while l am failing to put food on the table with the same salary.
16/02/24, 9:18 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Ok , we will see by then, if we have something tangiable.
17/02/24, 8:12 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263780466316 @263774097745 @263784489730 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
17/02/24, 8:17 am - Garima Edoofa: @263780466316 , I completely understand your situation, and some students are facing these hardships too, despite the hardships they are still enrolling because their parents understand the value of education and they do not want their child to land up in the same situation as them.

And I hope you also wish the best for your child only.

23/02/24, 9:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you are doing well!
23/02/24, 9:34 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I haven't heard from you since Monday, may I know what happened @263780466316?
23/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 046 6316: Yaaaah, God is in control. Your team said, they need USD350 by 25th of february , which is a day after tomorrow or USD200 this week then the balance next month
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Yes @263780466316, so have you happened to raise $200 as of now?
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 046 6316: I failed to secure that fund
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: What part of the fee have you raised @263780466316?
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Currently l have nothing due to unbearable conditions l am facing here
23/02/24, 12:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 how are you planning for Shammah's higher education in such a case?
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 046 6316: I have to look for money and try next time.
23/02/24, 12:41 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 you did meet me and you know that looking at the number of applicants each time it won't be possible for your child to get another chance!
23/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yes met on saturday at Martin Jnr Luther King in Warren Park, Harare.
23/02/24, 12:45 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: We met on Sunday @263780466316
23/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Kkkkk yes l mean on sunday
23/02/24, 12:47 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I clearly remember you shared with me that you are facing financial challenges however you shared you have $100 as preparations for your child for which you were given a flexible option of completing $100 within 2-3 days and then remaining $100 could have been completed by month end?
23/02/24, 12:47 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Does this mean you were not honest back when you met me on Sunday?
23/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 046 6316: I failed to secure it as l was expecting something (external hand) but it didn't work, that why l didn't bother to call you.
23/02/24, 1:14 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 so this means that if such a challenge continues Shammah will not be able to study further?
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 046 6316: I have no option, what is needed is registration fee and l am failing to get it. It means a blockage ahead
23/02/24, 1:21 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 if you think it that way surely it is a blockage, but this also means that you are not in a position to support your child at all, let alone in local university as well because for that as well funds would be required, isn't it?
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 046 6316: I will see next year in local college
23/02/24, 1:27 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 so you are willing for Shammah to drop for a year altogether?
23/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 046 6316: That is what is on the ground now. I tried in vain but l didn't get anything
23/02/24, 1:32 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 are you saying that you couldn't even manage to raise $100 towards Shammah's higher education?
23/02/24, 1:33 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Since if that is what you wish to believe then, unfortunately I would like to make it clear to you as well that even choosing to support your child for education in local university would mean that you would have to invest hundreds of dollars. You know the fee structure of local universities right?
23/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 046 6316: If you were in my shoes , maybe you would be in a better position to understand me.
23/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 046 6316: Yes l do
23/02/24, 1:36 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263780466316 I am not saying that I don't understand your situation, I am just asking you what have you decided!
23/02/24, 1:37 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: If you have decided to let this go then maybe I should speak with the Academic Board and get the Letter of Acceptance that was issued to Shammah revoked, because you clearly seem to have given up on supporting your child for higher education!
