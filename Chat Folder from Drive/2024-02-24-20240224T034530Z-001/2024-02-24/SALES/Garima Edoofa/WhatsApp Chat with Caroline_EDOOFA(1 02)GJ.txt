Sleep well
03/02/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
03/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 533 9661: Good morning
We can start
03/02/24, 10:16 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
03/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 533 9661: I think the are more opportunities and a wider  of choices outside my country
03/02/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
03/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 533 9661: The education system in my country as far as am concerned is not really bad. It is the opportunities and employment which are scarce. So learning from abroad will then maximise my chances and opportunity to improve the educational system and work industry in my country. In terms of technology Zimbabwe is a bit babbarick and backward as compared to other Asian and European countries. Studying abroad will definitely be of a benefit to me and others by applying what i have learnt abroad.
03/02/24, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Caroline, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
03/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 533 9661: I agree with you
03/02/24, 11:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 533 9661: True
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

05/02/24, 2:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-9000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Master of Legislative Laws** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$3000-$4000*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for your family?
05/02/24, 5:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

06/02/24, 11:35 am - Garima Edoofa: @263775339661 I would like to inform you that since your application was sent for evaluation I would like to tell you since you have not done a bachelor's degree in LAW so, therefore, you are not eligible for the master's degree in law, if you wish to pursue law then, in that case, you have pursued a bachelor's degree in LAW.

Since you have already pursued sociology in your graduation, As your counselor I would suggest you not pursue a Bachelor's degree again and instead do an MBA which is a master's in Business Administration, as you mentioned that after doing the bachelor's degree in sociology you were stilled unemployed, so I would suggest you to go for a degree that would reward you for your future. Considering the cost of doing an MBA will vary from $2000-$3000.

07/02/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-9000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
07/02/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 533 9661: Will talk to them and get back to you
07/02/24, 11:33 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
07/02/24, 11:34 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Caroline what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 533 9661: Ok i get it
07/02/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 533 9661: Yes you can
07/02/24, 1:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/02/24, 1:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/02/24, 1:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
07/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
07/02/24, 7:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
08/02/24, 8:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
08/02/24, 8:37 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes we can start
08/02/24, 8:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
08/02/24, 8:58 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes i think i will be benefiting
08/02/24, 9:04 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 9:04 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 9:04 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning, hope you all are doing well.

I would like to inform you, due to some urgent meeting we will commence the session at 10:30 AM CAT.
09/02/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 533 9661: Noted
09/02/24, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through this?
09/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes i did
09/02/24, 11:55 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/02/24, 11:55 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 533 9661: Earn while you learn
09/02/24, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Caroline, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
09/02/24, 6:39 pm - +263 77 533 9661: Yes
09/02/24, 7:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Caroline, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/02/24, 8:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:80 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
10/02/24, 8:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
10/02/24, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
10/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 533 9661: How are you.
 I will discuss with my family and come back to you
12/02/24, 9:03 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
12/02/24, 9:03 am - +263 77 533 9661: Good morning
12/02/24, 9:14 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
12/02/24, 9:22 am - +263 77 533 9661: Yes
12/02/24, 9:24 am - Garima Edoofa: Caroline as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/02/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 533 9661: $1500
12/02/24, 9:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/02/24, 9:25 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 9:25 am - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/02/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 533 9661: Ok. I dont have the application fee
12/02/24, 9:33 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
12/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 533 9661: Okay okay i get it
12/02/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/02/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Caroline basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
12/02/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/02/24, 10:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
13/02/24, 8:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263775339661 @263772433670 , Hope you all are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
