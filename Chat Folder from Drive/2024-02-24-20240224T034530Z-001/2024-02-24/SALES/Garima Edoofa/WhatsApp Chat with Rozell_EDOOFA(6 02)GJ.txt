*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

13/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 71 984 3143: First and foremost, I want to say that I would be incredibly grateful if you would grant me the opportunity to pursue my higher education abroad. It would be a tremendous honor to be considered for this scholarship.

Now, coming to the question, my primary aim would be to contribute towards the development of the education system in my country by bringing back with me all the knowledge and skills that I acquire during my stay abroad. I would also like to set up educational initiatives or projects in my country that would incorporate the latest teaching methodologies and practices from abroad. I am keen on contributing towards making my country's education system more holistic and well-rounded so that students can acquire the skills and knowledge that are needed to succeed in the globalized world. In addition to that, I would also like to set up educational initiatives or projects that focus on providing access to quality education to underprivileged or marginalized communities. I firmly believe that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and inequality, and I am committed to doing my part in making that happen.
13/02/24, 12:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Rozell, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 984 3143: Absolutely, the right environment is a key factor in achieving success in any field, and this is especially true when it comes to education. A conducive environment includes factors like access to good quality resources, a supportive learning community, and opportunities for hands-on learning. In order to be a reputed personality and make a significant contribution to one's community, one must have the right environment to develop the necessary skills and knowledge. Therefore, studying abroad can provide the necessary environment and resources to achieve success and make a positive impact.
13/02/24, 1:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 71 984 3143: In response to this question, I would like to point out that while India and many African nations share a similar colonial history, India has also undergone significant development and progress in the past few decades. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and has established itself as a major hub for higher education. There are several world-class universities in India that offer quality education at an affordable cost. In addition, there is a vibrant and diverse student community in India, which provides opportunities for international students to build a strong network. Therefore, despite its shared history with Africa, India offers unique opportunities for higher education.To further elaborate, it's important to note that India is home to many top universities, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), which are ranked among the best engineering schools in the world. In addition, India has a strong focus on research and innovation, which is reflected in the number of patents filed by Indian universities. Moreover, many Indian universities offer scholarships and financial aid to international students, making it a more affordable option for those looking for quality education. Finally, India's vibrant culture, diverse population, and welcoming people make it an exciting and enriching place to study.
13/02/24, 5:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate your knowledge about India and it's culture.
13/02/24, 5:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

I apologize for the delay in my reply. I was attending to a family emergency as my grandfather had passed away, which required my immediate attention.
22/02/24, 8:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Shall we start our session now?
22/02/24, 10:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
