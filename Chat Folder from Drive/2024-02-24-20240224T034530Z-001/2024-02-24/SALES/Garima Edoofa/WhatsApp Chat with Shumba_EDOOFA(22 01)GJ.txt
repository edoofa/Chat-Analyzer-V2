I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what course you would like to study, how much was your every term fee, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do (Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?

22/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 728 8894: My name is Shallom  Shumba  . I aged 19 . I did my primary school at Saint Judes Primary in Nyazura .I went to Mavhudzi High school since form one till I finished my A level . I was a prefect when I was in o level and I became the school headgirl at A level . Our fees was not constant it ranged from 350 - 450 US per term  . I was a science student and I'm good  academically but while at school I faced some challenges hence I couldn't produce the right results though I didn't fail but I believe I could have done better  . I would like to study electronics and electrical engineering . 
I'm a person who loves order and I try to perfect everything that I do . It comes as a problem when I'm working with people who do not put in the same effort as I am and I hate that . I work well as part of team provided we all put in the same effort to do the job  . If not this becomes bad on my side as I tend to do everything by myself till it is perfect and at times I end up getting consequences as other parts of my life end up not getting enough attention.
I work well with time .
I don't do well under pressure my mind seems to stop working . Im afraid of failing and disappointing not only myself but my family so I push myself to my limits to insure that it doesn't happen .
I hate crowds , I love my circle small that way I know everyone around me without fear of being backstabbed .
I easily get attached to people that's also another reason why I don't like too many people because I'm afraid at  times I'll care about people who wish bad things upon me .
Well growing up I lived with my mom she's
22/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I live with my grandparents , in Nyazura and at times I visit my Mother in Rusape . My grandmother aged 55 is a house wife  and my grandfather aged 75 is a pensioner of national railways of Zim . I have one sibling (female ) doing grade 5 .She also leaves with my grandparents .My mother is self employed . She ended school at form four .
22/01/24, 2:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to know about you and your family, Shumba
22/01/24, 2:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on what exactly you mean by Self-employed?

22/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Looking at the fee hikes in Zimbabwe recently  it seems as though it's almost the same thing

22/01/24, 6:17 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Well in five years I believe I would be in the industry working for at an automobile company or a company that deals with producing different cellphones or appliances gaining more experience after some time with the aim of becoming independent some day producing my own thing . If I get into Edoofa it will enable me to achieve my dream by enrolling me in a university where I'll have all the knowledge I need with a world wide recognized degree also it'll help in finding a job at a company where I'll gain more experience in my field such that when I decide to start my own company in my country I will be guaranteed that I will not fail
22/01/24, 6:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Shumba

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
22/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I am willing . I know it's not going to be an easy journey but I believe that all I need is focus ony final destination and endurance as it will get tough along way and faith that I can do it
22/01/24, 6:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/01/24, 6:32 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Firstly in my country due to the shortage of  universities as compared to the amount of students that would have set and passed the examinations there's stiff competition on the program that I would want to do like right now I have 10 points but because there will be many students who applied for it they raise to 13 points and above the electrical engineering   . Also since our country is still developing for the practicals one cannot get enough  knowledge practically as most industries are closed down and some may be far or too expensive to access . After one is done with their degree program you get into a situation where you go job hunting as there are few industries and many graduates while outside it will be easy to get a job once you are done and also as one would have learnt at one of the best universities  your chances to a good paying job is guaranteed due to the skills that one would have acquired
22/01/24, 6:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 77 728 8894: In developing my country I'll volunteer to go into the universities and share  my knowledge to  students  who would be  interested I'll be willing to share my knowledge with them as it takes more than one person to develop a country that way those I'd have shared my knowledge with can also use it and also reach out to others as well
22/01/24, 6:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Shumba, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I agree
22/01/24, 6:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes true
22/01/24, 6:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

22/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yeah a bit of it
22/01/24, 7:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Shumba, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
22/01/24, 7:07 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 1) well since we would engage with experts and high qualified lecturers in our field practically , studying in India would be good as I'll get to learn from the best .
2) I aim to make sure to grasp each and every teaching that I get and practicals that we would do studying and being focused so that nothing passes me
22/01/24, 7:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Shumba. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
22/01/24, 7:09 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I could only guess that it will be quite expensive
22/01/24, 7:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of education, please.
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes please
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 7:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/01/24, 7:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
22/01/24, 7:14 pm - +263 77 728 8894: It is
22/01/24, 7:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Shumba what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/01/24, 7:24 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Can you tell me more about the Earn  While  You Learn Program
22/01/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
22/01/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 7:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
22/01/24, 7:40 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes a lot . I believe I will benefit a lot as I would get exposure on may aspects and also being independent even before I'm done with my degree program
22/01/24, 7:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/01/24, 7:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/01/24, 7:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/01/24, 7:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
22/01/24, 7:55 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 2
22/01/24, 7:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Shumba, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/01/24, 7:59 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I am
22/01/24, 8:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 77 728 8894: 1500-2250
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/01/24, 8:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
22/01/24, 8:14 pm - +263 77 728 8894: It's good
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes please
22/01/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/01/24, 8:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood it properly?
22/01/24, 8:18 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I have
22/01/24, 8:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shumba, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
22/01/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Well from what I have understood Edoofa makes the educational funds become barrable as a student can do the Earn While You Learn Program and if they put in a lot of effort and seeking mentorship till they are good they can earn money to pay for their fees and reduce the load from their parents . Edoofa helps one gain skill while at it gain money which would help to save as well . Edoofa's aim in finances is that the students should be able to balance both and earn money and encourage learners to become innovative . Edoofa gets you in touch with CEOs of companies and you get to advertise and attending sessions regularly also seeking guidance one gets paid accoe to how they are working
22/01/24, 8:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood everything properly?
22/01/24, 8:34 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I have
22/01/24, 8:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Shumba and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
22/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Yes I have
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/01/24, 8:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/01/24, 8:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/01/24, 8:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/01/24, 8:42 pm - +263 77 728 8894: I do
22/01/24, 8:42 pm - +263 77 728 8894: My battery is about to die can we continue tomorrow
22/01/24, 8:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
23/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263777288894 @263778106011 , Hope you are doing well.
23/01/24, 9:37 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
23/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 728 8894: Greetings 
We are well thank you
23/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood till here, shall we continue?
23/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 728 8894: Ok
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

*After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 728 8894: So the registration fee will be a part of the annual fee
23/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 728 8894: Will the remaining fee get paid by the student once in India or it can be paid from Zimbabwe while the student is already there .Can the remaining fee be reduced as the learner does the EWYL program
23/01/24, 11:55 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
23/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 728 8894: We are
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/01/24, 12:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect Mrs. Ruth with your parents as well.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
23/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Ok thank you

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Wednesday on “24-01-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
23/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 728 8894: Ok will do
23/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 728 8894: You too thank you
23/01/24, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
24/01/24, 8:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263777288894 @263778106011 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
24/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 728 8894: Morning
24/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 728 8894: Yes
24/01/24, 8:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
24/01/24, 8:56 am - +263 77 728 8894: She spoke with my mom I've not yet been informed of their conversation
24/01/24, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what have she discussed with Mrs. Ruth?
24/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 728 8894: I'm still waiting to be informed by her
24/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 728 8894: As I had said before we do not live together so I'm waiting
24/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 728 8894: When I spoke to her she summarized all that you had told me and also stated that she did not have any problems with the program and that she is happy with it . She also  told me to follow all the instructions
24/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 728 8894: Im sorry for the late replies network is bad this side
24/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge, please.
24/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
24/01/24, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

03/02/24, 11:09 am - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/02/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
03/02/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
03/02/24, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

03/02/24, 11:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 10th or 11th February  2024 for $200 and the 10th or 11th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 10th or 11th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/02/24, 11:11 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.

05/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 810 6011: Can you explain further why the $200 is to be paid in 8 days
05/02/24, 2:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263778106011 I am sure you are aware that we have received over 59785 applications so far for 2024 and 2025 admissions and the seats reserved for African Students is only 5000. So, do you think it’s practically possible to give scholarship and admission to all these 59785 applicants?
05/02/24, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, when the academic board gives a student 7 days time to make the payment, it means that in that 7 days the seat is reserved in that students name. Now,when the student misses the deadline, it means that the seat which was reserved for the student is made free, and a student in the waiting list is given the chance. Now, if that student enrolls, the Seat will be reserved in his name. And you lose that seat.
05/02/24, 2:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understand why it is important to honor the deadline?
05/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 810 6011: I have a problem with the issue of securing " your seat"
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 810 6011: My take on the issue of scholaships is that they do not deal on a first come first served basis.Its not money that secure your scholaship seat.
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 810 6011: I also thought you  would sent a  list of universities on offer before any eligibility test.
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 810 6011: This would help us to decide
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263778106011 I think you are getting yourself a bit confused amongst Stage 3 and Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle please!
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Did you understand the Edoofa Cycle clearly first of all if I may ask please?
05/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 810 6011: May i  please know   which are we now
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 810 6011: ** stage**
05/02/24, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to refer to the steps of the Edoofa Cycle, please.
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 810 6011: You may help us please because we are confused
05/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 810 6011: You keep on  asking  questions i have already answered
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 77 810 6011: 👆
05/02/24, 4:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Addressing your question once again @263778106011, I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 4:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now what you have is a very common question that any family member of the student has is why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. 

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well. 

Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.

09/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 728 8894: Before we proceed o have had some advice from a few people in the past few days on my degree program and I wish to change it i hope it's possible
09/02/24, 11:15 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what is the specific reason?
09/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 728 8894: Well a few days back I went to school to collect my results and came across two of my teachers and they asked what I program I had planned to pursue and I told them and one told me about her son who did the same program and how he is struggling with it and wishing to had done something else . The other one told me to ask people who are in the field about it and not just base on knowledge that I have or just interest so I can choose wisely I did as asked then in the process I learnt that yes I'll be doing what I want but after 4 years I may end up regretting as well
09/02/24, 11:23 am - +27 84 720 2692: Noted
09/02/24, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to the course here?
09/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 728 8894: Sorry  can you rephrase that
09/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 728 8894: What I mean is yes I  love dealing with electrical gadgets and would love to do electrical engineering but u believe I made a rational decision by choosing it . Why I'm saying so is because I remember this time you asked me if I had someone who made me want to do it and I didn't that time I hadn't had all the information from people who had done it because I didn't think that there could be anything wrong but after I got in contact with them he advised me to do  something else as I could also end up regretting it like he is because it's at times it's not always about what you believe you want but also considering that after 4 years of studying it would you find it easy to get a job or to work as you had imagined or not . The reason I had chosen electrical engineering was because I thought that even without employment one can still make money from it doing your own thing which I found out that it is not exactly as I had imagined
09/02/24, 11:38 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to the course that you have selected?
09/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 728 8894: Yes
09/02/24, 11:41 am - +27 84 720 2692: Noted point taken

I am here to continue with our discussion, shall we start? <This message was edited>
16/02/24, 8:14 am - +263 77 810 6011: Good morning
16/02/24, 8:29 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
16/02/24, 8:39 am - +263 77 810 6011: What do mean by Parent company account
16/02/24, 10:22 am - Garima Edoofa: These are the two modes of fee payment methods.
16/02/24, 10:23 am - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the same?
16/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 810 6011: This message was deleted
16/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 810 6011: Yes
16/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: @263778106011 @27847202692 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
16/02/24, 10:37 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
