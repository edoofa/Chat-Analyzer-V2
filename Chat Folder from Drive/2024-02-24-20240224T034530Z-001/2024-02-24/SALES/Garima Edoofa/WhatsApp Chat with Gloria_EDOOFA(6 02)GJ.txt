09/02/24, 2:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
09/02/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 139 6111: I have ma'am ,India seems to be nice
09/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 139 6111: And very interesting
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Gloria, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
09/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Studying in India will have a positive impact in the sense that ,im sure and guaranteed that I will receive quality education. 
There is a lot of motivation that is coming from successful people who come from India, such motivation will push me to work harder and Excell in my career. 
 There are also chances of getting mentorship and guidance which will help me grow academically and professionally 

Also ,I will be likely to get a job  anyway in the world which is a blessing. 

Furthermore ,I will achieve my career aspirations through working hard, researching more about my career and also team working with others so as to gain more information,furthering my studies  to make myself more makertable and achieve the best results .
09/02/24, 3:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Gloria. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
09/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 139 6111: No I'm not aware ma'am enlighten us
09/02/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
09/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 71 139 6111: I will be discussing that with them ma'am thank you
09/02/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Gloria what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 4:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts about the same?
09/02/24, 8:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

May you kindly assist on this one so we move forward after exhausting thoroughly, both from your expertise and our experience as parents as well
10/02/24, 7:45 am - +263 78 452 6335: Initially you mentioned Bachelor of Arts in Geography, is it the same as Bachelor of Geography?
10/02/24, 8:28 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263711396111 @263784526335 , Hope you all are doing well.

10/02/24, 8:29 am - Garima Edoofa: @263784526335 it is the same course please, it was just the short form.
10/02/24, 8:58 am - +263 71 139 6111: We can continue ma'am
10/02/24, 9:04 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
10/02/24, 9:07 am - +263 71 139 6111: I think it's ok ma'am but can you kindly explain what do you mean by earn while you learn program
10/02/24, 9:10 am - +263 78 452 6335: Alright thanks
10/02/24, 9:10 am - +263 78 452 6335: And here???
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: @263784526335 I have answered your question, please.
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
10/02/24, 9:22 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
10/02/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 9:23 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
10/02/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 452 6335: Kindly refer to the response I may have missed it, sorry on that kindly assist
10/02/24, 9:31 am - Garima Edoofa: Gloria after discussing your application in today's meeting with the academic board, According to your aspirations and motivation Bachelor Of Arts in Geography is the perfect course that will be rewarding for you in the future.
10/02/24, 9:31 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood?
10/02/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 452 6335: Great skills there
10/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 71 139 6111: I understand thank you  ,so every student will getting a chance for this program
10/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 452 6335: Not yet. Are you saying she doesn’t have a wide choice except that Bachelor of Arts in Geography?
10/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 139 6111: I would benefit a lot
10/02/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, correct. 
As their are courses that need different subject criteria and considering that Gloria eligible of the Bachelor Of Arts In Geography.
10/02/24, 9:34 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
10/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 452 6335: This is where as parents we appreciate your career guidance. However it would be best to have a pool of courses where we can dig through other than given a choice of one course. That’s our opinion as Gloria’s parents 
We may be taking you back but kindly go through our concern with your Academic board, please

10/02/24, 9:36 am - Garima Edoofa: I have already discussed Gloria's application in the yesterday's meeting, please.
10/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 71 139 6111: Ohhhh this is great though  ,so does this program happen every semester or once in while
10/02/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 452 6335: Isn’t this like imposing a course on her ma’am ?
10/02/24, 9:42 am - +263 71 139 6111: I now fully understand thank you ma'am for enlightening me
10/02/24, 9:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Not at all, she liked this course and considering her aspiration, it it the best career that will be much more rewarding for her in the future.
10/02/24, 9:51 am - Garima Edoofa: This program happens every semester, please.
10/02/24, 9:51 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
10/02/24, 9:52 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
10/02/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 139 6111: Ohh ok
10/02/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
10/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 71 139 6111: This message was deleted
10/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 139 6111: I appreciate all of them especially the EWYL  program  however  ma'am after completing the course, will a student be able to futher his or her studies still under Edoofa program
10/02/24, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Gloria, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
10/02/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 139 6111: Yes ma'am thank you ,my parents will fully update you
10/02/24, 11:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263711396111 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 139 6111: I'm ready ma'am
10/02/24, 11:50 am - Garima Edoofa: @263711396111 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 139 6111: That would be around$ 1750 _$2250
10/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 139 6111: Would this be in Usd ?
10/02/24, 11:56 am - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/02/24, 11:56 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 139 6111: How many universities is a student advised to apply
10/02/24, 11:57 am - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/02/24, 11:57 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
10/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 139 6111: For one university or 5 of them ?
10/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 139 6111: Ohhhh ok
10/02/24, 11:57 am - Garima Edoofa: For the all the universities, please.
10/02/24, 11:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
10/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 139 6111: Ohhhhh I now understand
10/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 139 6111: I understand ma'am
10/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 71 139 6111: So you all guide a student in every step of the way
10/02/24, 12:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, correct.
10/02/24, 12:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/02/24, 12:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263711396111 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/02/24, 12:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/02/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 139 6111: I understand ma'am you mentioned that in phase 2 each student will have EWYL before a level results are out ,but I already have my  A level ,will l.still be in the EWYL program or
10/02/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263711396111 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
10/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Thank you ,I have understood that there is the EWYL program which is a package in the Edoofa program, this program has online projects in which if one is hardworking he or  she will earn some money and can end up covering  education costs. Furthermore the edoofa program reduces the cost of a student from $8000 to $ 3000 a year including accommodation ,food and tuition hence for a month the Student's family cost will be approximately$100.
Also for applying an Edoofian pays $750 to apply in different universities .if
10/02/24, 2:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350

10/02/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
10/02/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
10/02/24, 2:38 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Thank you l needed clarification there
10/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Yes ma'am

particular University chosen by you.

The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

10/02/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
10/02/24, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

10/02/24, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/02/24, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.

12/02/24, 9:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

12/02/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.

In that case, I hope they will respond on the group after they are back from the work?
12/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Ok ma'am thank you
12/02/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: I will be waiting for there response on the group, please.
12/02/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
12/02/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
12/02/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
12/02/24, 12:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 12:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 19th or 20th February  2024 for $200 and the 19th or 20th of march  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 19th or 20th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
12/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 139 6111: They will surely answer you ma'am

12/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Sure
12/02/24, 4:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know now they are available?
12/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 71 139 6111: They are not yet ma'am
12/02/24, 4:54 pm - +263 78 452 6335: Good day @918810545912  we knock off 1630hrs .Our schedule is we leave home 0600hrs and return 1900hrs after a long hectic drive 
We will follow through and respond accordingly
12/02/24, 10:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night

17/02/24, 12:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you, 

Having a general degree can still be advantageous for securing a job, especially when coupled with relevant skills. While specialized degrees can be beneficial for certain fields, a general degree demonstrates a broad knowledge base, adaptability, and the ability to learn new skills. Employers often value candidates who can think critically, communicate effectively, and work well in diverse teams—skills that are typically developed through a general education. Furthermore, if you have specific skills that are in demand in the job market, such as technical abilities, language proficiency, or project management skills, these can complement your general degree and make you a more attractive candidate to employers.
17/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 71 139 6111: Ok ma'am thank you
17/02/24, 12:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I think now a Bachelor of Arts in Geography, aligns with you?
