I first get interested in forestic auditing when I read the Enron scandal of 2001. Also I heard that it's an incredibly rewarding career
21/02/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your fascination with forensic auditing is truly commendable, especially as it harmonizes your enthusiasm for financial analysis, problem-solving, and a genuine desire to make a positive impact by helping others. The Enron scandal served as a pivotal moment, sparking your interest in forensic auditing and revealing its crucial role in maintaining financial integrity. Pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) would provide you with a specialized and in-depth understanding of accounting, finance, and related subjects, precisely aligning with your aspirations in forensic auditing. The comprehensive curriculum and focused coursework in a BCom program will equip you with the specific skills and knowledge needed for this intricate field. Moreover, the potential for a highly rewarding career in forensic auditing, coupled with your intrinsic motivation, makes a BCom an ideal pathway to cultivate expertise and contribute meaningfully to the financial sector. May I know whether you find that fascinating, please?
