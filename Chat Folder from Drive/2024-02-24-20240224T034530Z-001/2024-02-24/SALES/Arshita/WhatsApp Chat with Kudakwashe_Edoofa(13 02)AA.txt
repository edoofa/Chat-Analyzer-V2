I realised this could be a substantial opportunity for me.

2.) Edoofa offers scholarships for any institution in India from 50 to 90 percent of the fees depending on my previous grades.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
14/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 960 3463: From what I learnt or got from my research, the higher education system in India is quite vast and complex, but I'll try to give you a basic overview. The Indian education system is divided into two broad categories: general education and professional education. General education includes bachelor's and master's degrees in subjects like arts, science, and commerce.

14/02/24, 2:26 pm - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
14/02/24, 7:13 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 960 3463: India is somewhat a principled country and not only will it improve me educationally, but it shall also do so emotionally...
15/02/24, 12:35 pm - Arshita: Greetings!

*“Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
15/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Yes
15/02/24, 12:54 pm - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
15/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 960 3463: I have a rough idea
15/02/24, 12:58 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/02/24, 12:58 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 12:58 pm - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
15/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 960 3463: It's still a bit out of our budget Arshita
15/02/24, 1:02 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
15/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 960 3463: No, I would like to know more about it
15/02/24, 1:05 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/02/24, 1:05 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

15/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Yes I now can
15/02/24, 1:29 pm - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
15/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Point number 2
15/02/24, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

15/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 960 3463: I see
15/02/24, 1:46 pm - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 960 3463: I see there is indeed no limit
15/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 960 3463: My parents
15/02/24, 1:47 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
15/02/24, 1:48 pm - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 960 3463: They are excited and are very supportive of such.
15/02/24, 1:50 pm - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/02/24, 1:50 pm - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
15/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 960 3463: No
15/02/24, 1:52 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/02/24, 1:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Yes please
15/02/24, 1:56 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
15/02/24, 1:56 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
15/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Understood
15/02/24, 1:59 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
15/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Understood... however, I already have the Advanced level results as I wrote my examinations last year
15/02/24, 2:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 3:55 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
15/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Up to stage 3
15/02/24, 4:51 pm - Arshita: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
15/02/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Yes
15/02/24, 4:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
15/02/24, 4:53 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
15/02/24, 4:53 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
15/02/24, 4:53 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
15/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 960 3463: Yes... I sm now clear with the process
15/02/24, 7:14 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
15/02/24, 7:14 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Hope you are doing well! 

Are you ready for today's session?
22/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 960 3463: Yes
22/02/24, 9:41 am - Arshita: Please answer this
22/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 960 3463: 1.Artificial Intelligence 
2.India
3.3300 to 7700
4.1200 to 3000
5.350 dollars within 30 days
6.the EWYL program is a program that enables you to learn while earning at the same time. You earn scholarship credits through the EWYL, basically a student is given tasks and upon completion, they earn the credits. These credits are money in the form of fees because there is an Indian law that states that students on scholarships are not allowed to be paid in  cash, that is where the EWYL comes in and cheats such a law. Moreover the EWYL is not only an advantage when it comes to earning but it gives one the experience that they need such that they are ready for the final work they are to do after completing their programs. 
7. Yes
22/02/24, 10:19 am - Arshita: 1.Bachelor of Computer Application
22/02/24, 10:20 am - Arshita: Please correct point 3 and 4 by referring to this
22/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 960 3463: Arshita, why is it that you are giving me your own program, my passion is in Artificial intelligence.
22/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 960 3463: Okay
22/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 960 3463: 3. 6000 to 8000
4. 2000 to 3000
22/02/24, 10:30 am - Arshita: BCA covers all the aspects of computers, software and thus it includes artificial intelligence prospects also
22/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 960 3463: I know but I would rather specialize rather than just grasp the concepts
22/02/24, 10:32 am - Arshita: Yes, you can always specialise in it but the name of the bachelor degree is this, then you can always choose your majors
22/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 960 3463: The name of the program I want is Bachelors Honours Degree in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning.
22/02/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: For that you need to have mathematics and physics compulsory in your A level
22/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 960 3463: That is not according to the program portfolios I have Been looking at, Arshita
22/02/24, 10:44 am - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
22/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 960 3463: A bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence (AI) is usually considered a subset of computer science or engineering. 
So this is why I had chosen computer science.
I would like computer Science Majoring in AI
22/02/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: You are only eligible for BCA which is related to this field
22/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 960 3463: How come I am not eligible for computer science?
22/02/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) and B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) are both undergraduate degree programs, but they differ in terms of focus, curriculum, and the academic orientation they offer. Here are the key differences between BCA and B.Tech CSE:

Degree and Specialization:

BCA: BCA is a professional undergraduate degree that focuses on computer applications and software development. It provides a broader understanding of various computer science topics, including programming, database management, networking, and software development.
B.Tech CSE: B.Tech CSE is a more specialized degree that specifically focuses on the engineering aspects of computer science. It covers a wider range of subjects, including hardware, software engineering, algorithms, and system design.
Curriculum:

BCA: The BCA curriculum is designed to provide a strong foundation in computer applications. Courses may include programming languages, web development, database management, software engineering, and computer networks.
B.Tech CSE: The B.Tech CSE curriculum is more comprehensive and often includes a balanced mix of theoretical and practical aspects. It covers a broader range of subjects, including computer architecture, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and advanced programming.
Focus on Engineering:

BCA: BCA is more application-oriented and focuses on building practical skills in software development and computer applications. It is less focused on the engineering and theoretical aspects of computer science.
B.Tech CSE: B.Tech CSE is an engineering program that emphasizes both theoretical concepts and practical applications. It delves deeper into the core engineering principles of computer science, preparing students for roles in software development, system design, and other engineering-related areas.
Career Opportunities:

BCA: Graduates with a BCA degree typically find opportunities in software development, web development, database administration, and other application-oriented roles. BCA graduates are often employed as software developers, system analysts, or IT consultants.
B.Tech CSE: B.Tech CSE graduates have a broader range of career opportunities. They can work in software development, system engineering, network administration, research and development, and other specialized roles. B.Tech CSE graduates are often considered for more technical and engineering-oriented positions.
Duration:

BCA: The duration of a BCA program is typically three years.
B.Tech CSE: The B.Tech CSE program is also generally a four-year undergraduate degree.
In summary, while both BCA and B.Tech CSE programs focus on computer science, BCA is more application-oriented and provides a broader overview of computer applications, whereas B.Tech CSE is a more comprehensive and engineering-focused program that covers both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. The choice between the two depends on individual career goals and preferences.
