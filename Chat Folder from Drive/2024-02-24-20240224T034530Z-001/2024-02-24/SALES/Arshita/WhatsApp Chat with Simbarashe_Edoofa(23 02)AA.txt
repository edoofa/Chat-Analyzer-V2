23/02/24, 11:52 am - Arshita: Noted
23/02/24, 11:52 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 707 0072: I applied at Parul University but I couldn't manage to pay the tuition fee and failed to go there
23/02/24, 11:55 am - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $4000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
23/02/24, 11:55 am - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
23/02/24, 11:55 am - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*

23/02/24, 12:12 pm - Arshita: Absolutely!
23/02/24, 12:12 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
