14/02/24, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Noted
14/02/24, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
14/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I am.
14/02/24, 3:16 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
14/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 771 3324: No I haven't researched and applied to any University. It's my first time applying for a scholarship. Do you have an overview of what must be done and what will happen once I'm there?
14/02/24, 3:32 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
15/02/24, 5:08 pm - +263 71 771 3324: No I am not.
15/02/24, 5:09 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/02/24, 5:09 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 5:13 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Ok, I see. Thank you for enlightening me.
15/02/24, 5:16 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
15/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 71 771 3324: No i don't.
15/02/24, 5:17 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/02/24, 5:17 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

15/02/24, 5:23 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I think I will benefit well from the EWYL program.
15/02/24, 5:23 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 5:27 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Yeah, I think this will be quite useful considering my Moms current financial position. With the EWYL I will be able to help my mom to pay for the tuition fee.
15/02/24, 5:28 pm - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value.

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
15/02/24, 5:31 pm - +263 71 771 3324: I think the first one is more significant. If I might add, the last one too is also significant. <This message was edited>
15/02/24, 5:31 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

15/02/24, 5:33 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Wow, that's impressive
15/02/24, 5:33 pm - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/02/24, 5:34 pm - +263 71 771 3324: So how long does it take to earn my own certificate?
15/02/24, 5:35 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Thank you very much, that would be much appreciated.
15/02/24, 5:37 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
15/02/24, 5:39 pm - +263 71 771 3324: My mother will be helping me.
15/02/24, 5:39 pm - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/02/24, 5:40 pm - +263 71 771 3324: They are comfortable with it.
15/02/24, 5:41 pm - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/02/24, 5:41 pm - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
15/02/24, 5:47 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Ok I will provide these. When are these required?
15/02/24, 5:51 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will help you with it.
15/02/24, 5:51 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/02/24, 5:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 5:59 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Yes
15/02/24, 5:59 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
15/02/24, 5:59 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
15/02/24, 6:05 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Ok, i will let her know.
15/02/24, 6:05 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
15/02/24, 7:09 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at *9:30 AM CAT (16/02/2024) Friday*
to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

*Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameter of evaluation.*

In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session

Stay Blessed!
16/02/24, 9:32 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*Your passion is waiting for your courage to catch up.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?

16/02/24, 10:00 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
16/02/24, 10:00 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
16/02/24, 10:00 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
16/02/24, 10:00 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
16/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 771 3324: Ok, sure
16/02/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I am.

16/02/24, 8:13 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
17/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 71 771 3324: Yes I am doing good, thank you for asking. I managed to discuss with my family about the Edoofa Program and they were quite delighted to hear about it's aims and opportunities that it  gives to deserving students.

17/02/24, 12:47 pm - +263 71 771 3324: Ofcourse. Well, after reading the Edoofa Program FAQ pdf, I discussed with family how Edoofa can help me with a scholarship. They were thrilled to hear how students get the opportunity to further their careers through affordable higher education. They now know that the Program helps the student aquire skills that make the student employable through the Earn While You Learn Program, which offers very structured and practical training. My family learnt that the EWYL program helps the student to reduce the annual tuition fee by rewarding scholarship credits which work as payment. They thought this was very helpful and beneficial to the student in terms of work experience. They now understand that Edoofa plays an important role in guiding the students according to their aspirations in life, from admission to the best and affordable universities up to the point of success. After hearing only a little of what Edoofa is capable of doing, they were thrilled and willing to sacrifice finacially and they are hoping that I would get a seat in the program. They were also impressed by the fact that the program offers a range of 50-100% funds, which means that I would not have to worry too much about the cost of my education. Overall my family was very positive about the program and they were happy to see me pursuing it. I hope I didn't leave anything important in my discussion with them.
17/02/24, 12:59 pm - Arshita: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
17/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 771 3324: All their questions have been answered through the discussion, so they don't have any more questions.
