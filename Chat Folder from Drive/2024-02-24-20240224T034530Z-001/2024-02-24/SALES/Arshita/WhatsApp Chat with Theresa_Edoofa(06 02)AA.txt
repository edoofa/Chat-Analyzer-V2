On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
12/02/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
12/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 71 318 3225: I would say that the most significant aspect of the Edoofa program is the "Earn While You Learn" aspect. As a student, it can be difficult to find meaningful work experience while also juggling the demands of higher education. The Edoofa program provides a great opportunity for students to gain valuable work experience while they are studying, which is a huge advantage when it comes to finding a job after graduation. Having real-world experience can make all the difference when it comes to getting your foot in the door of your chosen field. Plus, being able to earn money while you are studying can help offset the cost of tuition and living expenses
12/02/24, 12:04 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures

12/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 71 318 3225: You are correct. After this session, I will definitely share all the valuable insights and information I have gathered today with my family.

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.

13/02/24, 5:20 pm - Arshita: Greetings!
13/02/24, 5:20 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/02/24, 5:20 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

14/02/24, 2:47 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,

*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*

*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
14/02/24, 2:47 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

*“Either you run the day or the day runs you.” — Jim Rohn*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
19/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 318 3225: Yes we can
19/02/24, 4:24 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
19/02/24, 4:27 pm - +263 71 318 3225: Okay i have heard you
19/02/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

19/02/24, 4:30 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
19/02/24, 4:30 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/02/24, 4:30 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
19/02/24, 4:30 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
19/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 71 318 3225: Yes very clear
19/02/24, 4:38 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision.

22/02/24, 9:54 am - +263 71 318 3225: Absolutely, I can share a summary of my discussions with my family about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. My parents were initially skeptical about the program, as they were not familiar with Edoofa and its offerings. However, after I explained the program in detail and showed them the Edoofa website, they became more open-minded. They were impressed by the affordability of the program, as well as the opportunity to earn while learning. They also liked the idea of earning a US degree while staying in my home country. Overall, they were supportive of my decision to apply for the program and encouraged me to pursue my education.That's all
22/02/24, 9:54 am - Arshita: May I know how studying in home country as you will be studying in India?

22/02/24, 10:10 am - Arshita: May I know what questions?
22/02/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 318 3225: That's correct, I made sure to explain the Edoofa Scholarship Program in the same way you explained it to me. My family does have a few questions. Firstly, they want to know if the Edoofa Scholarship Program is recognized by employers in my home country. Secondly, they want to know if there are any additional requirements,  that I would need to fulfill in order to qualify for the program. Lastly, they want to know if there are any specific deadlines that I need to be aware of.
22/02/24, 10:14 am - Arshita: 1. *Regarding Job*

22/02/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 318 3225: Noted
22/02/24, 10:20 am - Arshita: Any other questions?
22/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 318 3225: No
22/02/24, 10:21 am - Arshita: May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
22/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 318 3225: My family's main concern with the financial aspects of the program is whether the fees are fixed and whether there are any hidden costs. They also want to know if there are any additional expenses, such as travel costs or living expenses, that I would need to consider. They are also interested in learning more about the scholarship opportunities and the eligibility criteria. I hope these answers will help clarify their concerns.
22/02/24, 10:29 am - Arshita: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by an Edoofian through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
22/02/24, 10:29 am - Arshita: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
22/02/24, 1:34 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:35 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
