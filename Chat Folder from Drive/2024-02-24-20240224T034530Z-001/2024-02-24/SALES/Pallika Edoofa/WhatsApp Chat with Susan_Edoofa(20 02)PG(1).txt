Furthermore, what could have left with him (my father) is interest and wishes without money
22/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Susan, I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your family's cattle and the challenges your father is facing. It's evident that he had high hopes for your education, and it's understandable that he's been under significant stress trying to find alternative means to support you and your sister.
22/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
22/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!
