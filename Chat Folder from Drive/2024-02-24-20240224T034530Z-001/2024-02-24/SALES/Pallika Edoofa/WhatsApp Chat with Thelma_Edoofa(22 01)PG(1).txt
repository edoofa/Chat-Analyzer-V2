07/02/24, 12:02 pm - +27 74 944 6821: I'm not familiar with that
07/02/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
07/02/24, 12:58 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Yes it is affordable
07/02/24, 12:59 pm - +27 74 944 6821: It is next to what we are paying now <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
07/02/24, 1:14 pm - +27 74 944 6821: I have no idea on how it operates
07/02/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/02/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
07/02/24, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
07/02/24, 2:17 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Yes i  will benefit a lot on the EWYLP .
07/02/24, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
07/02/24, 3:41 pm - +27 74 944 6821: I understand how it helps and appreciate it
07/02/24, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
07/02/24, 4:00 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Stage 4
07/02/24, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

07/02/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/02/24, 4:43 pm - +27 74 944 6821: My parents will pay the out standing balance after the Edoofa scholarship and EWYLP
07/02/24, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/02/24, 4:54 pm - +27 74 944 6821: It is their wish also
07/02/24, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
07/02/24, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
07/02/24, 10:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 6:28 am - +27 74 944 6821: Waal nice to here
08/02/24, 6:29 am - +27 74 944 6821: We can resume at 12:00 hrs.
08/02/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

I am here to begin the session today,

Shall we begin?
08/02/24, 11:45 am - +27 74 944 6821: We are fine and thanks
08/02/24, 11:45 am - +27 74 944 6821: Let's go on
08/02/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
08/02/24, 11:48 am - +27 74 944 6821: I'm fine
08/02/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
08/02/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have understood till now!
08/02/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/02/24, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:55 am - +27 74 944 6821: Yes reveal it to me
08/02/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
08/02/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
08/02/24, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Noted
08/02/24, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 9:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I hope that you are doing well.

Shall we begin the session?
09/02/24, 10:29 am - +27 74 944 6821: Yes we went through all the 6 stages above
09/02/24, 10:29 am - +27 74 944 6821: Let's continue with the session
09/02/24, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
09/02/24, 10:40 am - +27 74 944 6821: Yes I'm prepared
09/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me explain the remaining steps
09/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
09/02/24, 10:54 am - +27 74 944 6821: Very well
09/02/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
09/02/24, 10:58 am - +27 74 944 6821: As for now i don't have any queries
09/02/24, 10:59 am - +27 74 944 6821: I'm copying
09/02/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thelma, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*

My parents were particularly impressed by the availability of a payment plan to pay the registration fee, of a team of experts to help me navigate the process and also the prospects of employment once I graduate.

Finally, we were also very excited about the Earn While You Learn program and as a family, we welcome agreed that this is not an opportunity to be missed.
10/02/24, 8:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/02/24, 11:52 am - +27 74 944 6821: Good morning
11/02/24, 11:53 am - +27 74 944 6821: 1. Business Management

2. In India, Asia

3. Without a scholarship, the average cost of studies in India is between $6000 and $8000 per year.

4. Eligible students will pay $2000- $3000 per year.

5. The enrolment fee of $350 is payable in 7 days.

6. In my understanding, the Earn While You Learn program will achieve two objectives: one, to equip me with entrepreneural skills which will compliment the Business Management skills that my study program is designed to equip me with. Skills such as marketing, cash flow management skills and many more and, 2. whatever I earn will go towards my tuition and other expenses, ensuring that I continue with my studies without putting too much pressure on my parents financially.


7. Definitely. I understand that a fee of $500 - 1000 will be paid in two installments which goes towards reserving a seat for me at the University I will be studying with. The first instalment will be due in August 2025 and the second one in January of 2026. <This message was edited>
11/02/24, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well done, Thelma!
11/02/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263716072711 @263714500745 @27623744133 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
11/02/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
11/02/24, 12:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!

11/02/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mr. Godfrey
11/02/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

11/02/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/02/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
11/02/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/02/24, 12:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 19th or 20th of February 2024 for $200 and the 19th or 20th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 19th or 20th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
12/02/24, 9:14 am - +27 74 944 6821: I opt for once off payment plan unfortunately it comes while I'm not prepared.
12/02/24, 9:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, May I know the concern, please?
12/02/24, 9:20 am - +27 74 944 6821: As i indicated before that I'm  self employed all I'm doing is going according to budget. I paid Thelma's school fees and finish end of January so I'm preparing her exam fee again so if u give me time i will definitely  pay .
12/02/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dear Parent, Let me discuss the same with our Academic Board and let me see what I can do for you!
12/02/24, 9:26 am - +27 74 944 6821: Thank you for underinging me .
12/02/24, 2:51 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Understanding me
12/02/24, 7:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Godfrey, 
I have a word with the academic Board, and I would lie to share that and we have ensured to reward deserving students with the best possible opportunities. There are 370+ Edoofians just from Zimbabwe who arrived in India last year and they are not all from great backgrounds, there have been struggles and sacrifices behind the journey of each Edoofian considering the long-term vision. At the same time, we need to be fair with all applicants and we are experiencing a surge in the number of applications with limited scholarship seats. Therefore, it would be challenging to hold the application of your child for long. But considering your plan for your child's career and strong passion towards the program, if I request our Academic Board for a payment plan in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days, $100 by the 26th of February if your child qualifies, will it be feasible for you?
13/02/24, 8:58 am - +27 74 944 6821: Noted
13/02/24, 9:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, May I know if you are comfortable with this plan?
13/02/24, 5:43 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Yes i am
13/02/24, 7:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
13/02/24, 7:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know if Thelma is available?
14/02/24, 9:33 am - +27 74 944 6821: Not always
 i will try to contact her principal
14/02/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is alright!
14/02/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Thelma?*
14/02/24, 10:40 am - +27 74 944 6821: Allow me to contact her principal first and here whether they can offer her a chance to use her cell phone
16/02/24, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was not well.

On a fresh note, Shall we continue?
16/02/24, 1:04 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Yes we can continue
16/02/24, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting your response on this please!
16/02/24, 5:09 pm - +27 74 944 6821: Yes I'm willing
16/02/24, 8:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
