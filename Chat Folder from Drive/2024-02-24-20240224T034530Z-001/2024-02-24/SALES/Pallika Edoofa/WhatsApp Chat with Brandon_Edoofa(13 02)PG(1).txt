We have received the application of Simango for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
13/02/24, 1:11 pm - +27 67 113 3695: Thank you for having me here, you can proceed <This message was edited>
13/02/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Brandon and His mom to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
13/02/24, 1:14 pm - +27 67 113 3695: Thank you

13/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
13/02/24, 2:04 pm - +27 67 113 3695: So this simply means it's not a fully funded program
13/02/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Nyarai, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.
13/02/24, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!

I am in a family of nine children; six boys and three girls and I'm the first born. My siblings are going to school except two. One is form 4 the other is form 2. Some of them are still Primary students, 2 in grade 6, one is grade 4 and the last one is grade 2.I studied my primary education at Birchenough Bridge Primary school from 2009 to 2017 where we used to pay $20 per term. I then went to Devuli secondary school for my secondary education from 2018 to 2021 where we used to pay $40 per term. I completed my O level very well and passed 8 subjects. I then transferred to St Patrick's High for my advanced level from 2022 to 2023 and the fees was $170 per term. I was studying Pure Mathematics, Physics, Computer science and Biology then got 14 points. I am a person with several strengths such as fast learner, Honesty, flexibility, teamwork, problem solver, discipline, creative and communicative. I sometimes experience these weaknesses of me ; irritable and self criticism. I came from a low income family but I don't want my dreams to study Pharmacy abroad to be overshaded by my background and I think we Edoofa my dreams will come true.

20/02/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
20/02/24, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
20/02/24, 5:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Edoofa recommends India as a higher education platform and according to my research, I see that India has several advantages to students. Indians embraced English with gusto right from the beginning. This is an advantage. The warmth and affection that the country and its people display  towards foreigners also makes it a hot spot of study tours. sciences are rigorously practiced in India. We found people of Indian origin at the top and India scientists making path-breaking technological research and advances. Even some of the best Doctors in USA and UK are Indians. Study tours to India are often made to study and observe the rigorous curriculum that gives rise to such brainy and enterprising students of medicine and technology.
21/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
I hope that your day is progressing well today.

Shall we start?
21/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 008 4080: We are fine Ms Pallika. How are you today.
21/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: It's a little hectic for me today!
21/02/24, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Brandon, Thank you for sharing your insights into the advantages of pursuing higher education in India. It's evident that India offers numerous benefits for students, including a strong embrace of English, a welcoming and hospitable environment for foreigners, and a rigorous academic curriculum particularly in the fields of science and technology. The country's contributions to technological research and advancements, as well as its notable presence in the medical field globally, further underscore India's appeal as a destination for study tours and higher education opportunities.
21/02/24, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
21/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 008 4080: Yes,The average cost of education in India for international students is $6000-$8000/ year without any scholarship.
21/02/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/02/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
21/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Yes I can feel it. The reduced cost of education is affordable to our family.
21/02/24, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
21/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Yes, this is done by the Earn while you learn program. It is an Edoofa Employability initiative which students are assigned real-time live online projects during which they gain valuable work experience while also earning scholarship credits that can be used to offset a portion of their higher education fees, making university education more affordable.
21/02/24, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/02/24, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
21/02/24, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
21/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Straightaway, I can see that I will also benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program which the students are given to gain excellent work experience While getting opportunity to earn scholarship credits.
21/02/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly!
21/02/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
21/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Well!! So amazing. It is very clear that the EWYL program reduces the financial pressure on families.
21/02/24, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
21/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 008 4080: The 4th one (Higher Education Concierge) 
It is the most significant one because it involves caretaking like helping students from Career selection which ensures that students can choose the right program that can sustain them even after there journey of Higher education with Edoofa.
21/02/24, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

21/02/24, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 008 4080: My parents will be helping me with the remaining fee after the Edoofa scholarship and the EWYL program
21/02/24, 2:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 008 4080: My family is always by my side since the day I started willing to study abroad.They are all interested
21/02/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
21/02/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
21/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 008 4080: That is all what I know
21/02/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
21/02/24, 3:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Yes you can inform me.
21/02/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
21/02/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
21/02/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
21/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Okay I understand
21/02/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 008 4080: We have discussed upto  stage 2
21/02/24, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Brandon,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
21/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Yes Ms Pallika you can explain and I have also read about them on this document as well
21/02/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
21/02/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
21/02/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
21/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Yes Ms Pallika I'm  clear with the process.
21/02/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
21/02/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 008 4080: Not yet Ms Pallika, maybe later.
21/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
21/02/24, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Brandon,  we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
