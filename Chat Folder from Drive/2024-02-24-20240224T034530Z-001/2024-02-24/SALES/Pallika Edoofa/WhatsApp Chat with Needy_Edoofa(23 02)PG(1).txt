23/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Needy, it's good to see that you've invested time in understanding the program and submitting your application. Could you please share:
1)  What inspired you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your insights and understandings of the program as per your discussions with *Munyaradzi*?
23/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Kaitano,  I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
23/02/24, 11:18 pm - +263 78 926 1028: 1. Well,I was inspired to apply for this scholarship because of my friend who benefited from the program,so as a financially disadvantaged person,I then found it an opportunity to apply.
2. My understanding about the program is,Edoofa helps scholars to pursue their higher education affordably. It considers potential but disadvantaged scholars. That's why I gained confidence to apply.
23/02/24, 11:27 pm - +263 78 926 1028: Thank you. Iam Mr Kaitano,the father to Needy. 
1. I am not formally employed, but rather a peasant Farmer .
2. I only managed to reach ordinary level ,came up with fair results. 
3. My parents failed me financially, to propel with my education to higher levels. This is the very reason I am so concerned about the education of my boy. I want to see him excelling ,which I believe it will be through your scholarship program. As a mere peasant Farmer,I can't afford the tuition required
