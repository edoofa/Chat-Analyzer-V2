22/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 635 1660: Okay I am a 17 year old boy who goes by the name Denzel Max Washaya. I did my primary education in Alan Redfern primary school. I then advanced to Thekwane high school for my Secondary education. At school I did 12 subjects in sciences which are Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, PureMathematics, English, Ndebele, Geography, Computer Science, Combined Science, History and Technical Graphics and design. I scored 7 A's 4B's and 1C. After that I did not do my A'level. My strength at school was Biology since I was so very interested in anatomy and physiology. My weakness was History since I hated reading numerous and several dates. I always wanted to be a doctor or pilot from my childhood so I would like to do medicine or aviation.
22/02/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Received please,

22/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 635 1660: I heard about premed in Zambia that O'levels can do
22/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Alright,

Here in India you can pursue Diploma after your O level.
22/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 635 1660: in aviation
22/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: You happened to mention your interests are medicine and Aviation!

Which out of the two are you more inclined towards?
22/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Medicine
22/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you for the same, Denzel?
22/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 635 1660: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know of your kind motives, Denzel.

I can see you are aiming at helping others.
22/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: So did you happen to research about the requirements to pursue Medicine or Engineering?
22/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 635 1660: I saw that you can do diploma in aviation after O'level or premed
22/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: A level results in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement to pursue Aerospace Engineering.
22/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Then medicine
22/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 635 1660: How about premed
22/02/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Considering your results and interest, you can pursue-

*Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*Diploma in Civil Engineering*
22/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Will I be a doctor after that
22/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Is it full funding schorlaship
22/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

22/02/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship only for those who wish to study in India!
22/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok so its how many percent schorlaship
22/02/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Denzel?
22/02/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.
22/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah I want the 100% schorlaship
22/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 71 635 1660: The examination
22/02/24, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: We offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee, Denzel!
22/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok
22/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Wow that is wonderful
22/02/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
22/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok
22/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Denzel did you happen to research about the education system of Zambia and India?
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 635 1660: So what is next
22/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for.

Were you aware of the same?
22/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I was aware of the same
22/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: So as of now, may I know which program would you like to opt for Denzel?
22/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 635 1660: If I first do premed can I get the schorlaship of medicine
22/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Like Biology,Chemistry ,Physics and Pure Maths
22/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you I want to do it
22/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Can I do medicine with the same schorlaship if I pass
22/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 635 1660: How many years is the diploma
22/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Can you explain the duration from diploma to medicine
22/02/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: 3 years for the Diploma.
3 years for the Bachelors.
2/3 years of the masters that you would like to opt for.
22/02/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: After O level the entire duration is of 8 years.

Now if you pursue A level as well still you would spend 8 years as Medicine in Zimbabwe takes close to 6 years itself along with 2 years of A level.
22/02/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**
   - MD is a postgraduate degree that medical professionals pursue to specialize in a specific field of medicine. Specializations can include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, pathology, etc.

2. **Master of Surgery (MS):**
   - Similar to MD, MS is a postgraduate degree that focuses on surgical specialties. Surgeons typically pursue this degree to specialize in areas such as general surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology, etc.

3. **Diplomate of National Board (DNB):**
   - DNB is a postgraduate or postdoctoral degree in various medical specialties. It is offered by the National Board of Examinations in India and is equivalent to MD or MS.

4. **Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pathology (DCP):**
   - This is a diploma program that focuses on clinical pathology and is suitable for individuals with a background in laboratory technology.

5. **Masters in Public Health (MPH):**
   - If you are interested in public health, an MPH degree could be a good option. It covers a range of topics including epidemiology, health policy, biostatistics, and environmental health.

6. **Hospital Management/Administration:**
   - You may consider pursuing a Master's in Hospital Administration or Healthcare Management to take on administrative roles in healthcare organizations.

It's important to note that the specific options available to you may depend on the admission requirements of the medical schools or universities in the country where you plan to pursue further studies. Additionally, some countries may have specific requirements for international medical graduates, so it's advisable to research the admission criteria for the institutions you're interested in.

Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. It's crucial to carefully research and understand the educational and licensing requirements of the country in which you plan to practice medicine.

22/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - +263 71 635 1660: I hope that one day I will be a surgeon graduated from India
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/02/24, 5:37 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah I was told that some diploma programs are around $2000
22/02/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Let me correct you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 5:43 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Okay so if I get 100% schorlaship I will only be left with accommodation and food
22/02/24, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/02/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
22/02/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Another batch of Proud Edoofians who will be coming to India this year in August.

22/02/24, 6:23 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes
22/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/02/24, 6:31 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Okay so lets say I get the schorlaship and the earn while you learn program how much will I be earning from earn while you learn program
22/02/24, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity?
22/02/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok and I will be willing to work hard in order to earn more
22/02/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 635 1660: So if I am willing to work more I can fund everything on my annual expenses
22/02/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great
22/02/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
22/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
22/02/24, 7:44 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I am ready
22/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 71 635 1660: $1500 to $2250
22/02/24, 7:48 pm - +263 71 635 1660: When applying to 5 university
22/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/02/24, 7:51 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Okay I understand
22/02/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/02/24, 7:52 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Is it compulsory to apply to 5 universities
22/02/24, 7:53 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah that is true it cuts away many costs
22/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah I understand but what if I don't afford $750 and want to apply to 1 or 2 universities
22/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: *Denzel, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: The fee is $350 not $750
22/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. 

It is paid after you are found eligible and once you receive an Acceptance letter.
22/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Okay I understand
22/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/02/24, 8:01 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah I understand
22/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 8:05 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok so they will send me the offer letter then I pay registration
22/02/24, 8:05 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yah I understand
22/02/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
22/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: I  will also be personally requesting Lindiwe to connect with you and share regarding her journey!
She happens to be one of my students along with Enest, Blessed, Blessing, etc from your school.
22/02/24, 8:13 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok I can see the twins are enjoying in India
22/02/24, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
22/02/24, 8:14 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok please do so
22/02/24, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: You can connect with Mrs Ruth and request your parents to connect as well!
22/02/24, 8:15 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok I have done that thank you
22/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So as of now would you like to ask anything?
22/02/24, 8:19 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I wanted to ask that is the MD or MS for 2 years or its more because according to my research online they were saying you first do premedical sciences for 4 years then do medicine for another 4 years after BMLT
22/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
22/02/24, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. <This message was edited>
22/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: If you happen to pursue MD otherwise as well in total it takes a student 12 years to complete the entire education.
22/02/24, 8:29 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok so I can do MS in India right
22/02/24, 8:30 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Master of Surgery
22/02/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: As we discussed earlier, India has stricts requirements for Medicine directly.

However after completing your Bachelors you can apply for medical residential and pursue the same in the western part of the world.
22/02/24, 8:34 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you Ms Harmehak

What all did you happen to discuss?
23/02/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 635 1660: <Media omitted>

23/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok mem
23/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Have you all already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future..
23/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I connected with her and it was truly a touching and motivating experience Ms Harmehak
23/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

Did your parents also happen to connect?
23/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I showed them
23/02/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Didn't they themselves happen to connect with Mrs Ruth?
23/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 71 635 1660: No they did not but they were also touched by her story
23/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, however do connect them with both Mrs Ruth and Lindiwe or her parents!
23/02/24, 10:05 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok I will Ms Harmehak
23/02/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
23/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you
23/02/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
23/02/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 71 635 1660: I have watched the video it was wonderful indeed
23/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Good to know that!
23/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Okay so Denzel, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 71 635 1660: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: You have to type your answers please.

23/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 71 635 1660: Yes they are
23/02/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their support!

Could you please request them to participate and acknowledge the same using a voice note please?
23/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok Ms Harmehak
23/02/24, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
23/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok
23/02/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: By when shall I expect their response?
23/02/24, 11:30 am - +263 71 635 1660: A few minutes from now
23/02/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
23/02/24, 11:31 am - +263 71 635 1660: Ok
23/02/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 285 2559: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mrs Samkelisiwe!

I appreciate your kind words and support for Denzel!
23/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
23/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
23/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
23/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 285 2559: Yes as the parents we are willing to support him as long he commits himself so that he persue his dreams.
23/02/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/02/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/02/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th of February 2024 for $200 and the 28th or 29th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th of February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 285 2559: I really appreciate your program ma'am. But right now I'm not financially prepared. Especially with the amount which must be paid at the end of February only few days left I can't raise the money in these few days left.
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Mrs Samkelisiwe!

May I know how much time do you need to raise the initial $200?
23/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Since it's something which was not in our budget just give us 3-4 months coz right now his brother needs fees and rentals for university
23/02/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Samkelisiwe, you need 3-4 months to raise $200 please?
23/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Yes ma'am right now my budget is tight the is a lot of money needed from his brother's university
23/02/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: While I understand,

I hope you are aware that his application is for 2024 intake?
23/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: 3 months from now there won't be any seats left for 2024 intake itself.
23/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: As you must have seen students are already enrolling for 2025 intake.
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Is it ok if we reserve for 2025 intake
23/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Do you wish to take a one year gap, Denzel?
23/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey ma'am I understand but due to financial constraints you better enroll him for 2025.I was thinking that you you have 2 intakes per year
23/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I do want to take a gap year its ok
23/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
23/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
23/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Then Ms Harmehak I wanted to ask that if I complete premed in Biology, Chemistry, PureMaths and Physics will I be eligible for degree programs in the 2025 intake
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Samkelisiwe if you wish to consider his application for 2025 intake,

I believe you understand that the same would also require financial support please?
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: A level is required for Degree, Denzel.
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you
23/02/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, may I know what exactly are your current queries itself?

I believe your were given thorough time yesterday to discuss with your parents please, isn't it?
23/02/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Didn't you happen to discuss regarding the enrollment fee too?
23/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 635 1660: There are no queries
23/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: In that case, didn't you happen to have a detail discussion please?
23/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: It's important to understand that I have initially mentioned as well that the first part is paid within 7 days itself please.
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Yes I understand it skipped us but for the 2025 intake we will be prepared
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey ma'am I understand. In your programs do you offer Bachelors Degree in Medicine??
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Sure,

As of now do you wish for your application to be considered for 2025 intake or hold your application itself?
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Consider it for 2025
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Yes consider it for 2025
23/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: So are you financially prepared to proceed ahead with his application for 2025 intake?

If he is found eligible initially you will have to make a payment of $200 itself.

After the same he will begin with his EWYL program.
23/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Similar to the students from Thekwane High School who are currently doing Upper 6 and would be coming to India next year.
23/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Yes ma'am
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Denzel 's brother did A level at Thekwani and he also obtained 18points in science subjects will share with him your programs maybe he will be interested too
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.

Kindly share his results and the degree he is interested in pursuing please.

23/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 285 2559: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: He cannot continue from the current degree please.
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey so how can you help us ma'am
23/02/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: He would have to begin the degree from the start after appearing a NEET exam.

As I was briefing Denzel yesterday, for an Indian student to pursue Medicine as well, NEET is a strict requirement.
23/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey ma'am thank you. Let me talk to him first. If he is interested will give him your contacts
23/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Can the NEET exams be done online
23/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: No please.

The students have to come to India, prepare for the same and then appear for the test please.
23/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
23/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you
23/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
23/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 635 1660: So after the NEET exam can you give him the schorlaship
23/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: He need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year.

If he happens to clear the same he can pursue Medicine!

But it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course as discussed above,
23/02/24, 1:14 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok if not a course it is offered as what
23/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: We don't offer medicine, Denzel.
23/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same please?
23/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Ok thank you
23/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Dear parents are you willing to proceed ahead with Denzel's application and pay $200 within 7 days if he is found eligible for the August 2025 intake?
23/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 635 1660: Are they not paying next year
23/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall the same, Denzel?
23/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 285 2559: As long it will be 2025 intake it's fine. Meaning will pay this amount next February 2025
23/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: That is not how the process and application works please, Mrs Samkelisiwe.
23/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey when should it be paid ma'am??
23/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
23/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to follow the same please?
23/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 285 2559: As I said before. If I must pay within 7 days I'm sorry I don't have the money at the moment. My budget is tight
23/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mrs Samkelisiwe!

Let me discuss the application with Academic Board and get back to you!
23/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 285 2559: Okey
