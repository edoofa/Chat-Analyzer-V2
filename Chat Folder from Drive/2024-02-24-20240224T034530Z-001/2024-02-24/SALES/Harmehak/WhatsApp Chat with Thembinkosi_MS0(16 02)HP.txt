17/02/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Descent!

So what motivates you for the same and whall did you research regarding the course and requirements?
17/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 879 2337: Like I had said my Father is a farmer so that is what I do since I was younger and l know that there is more work specifications you can do and l heard that the requirements should be from different areas of subjects like the association of business studies Crop science and also geographical information may be required
17/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Descent!

While I understand what you are sharing I happened to notice that other students from Mt Selinda had Biology in their subject combination instead of Buisness studies!

What are your thoughts on the same?
17/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 879 2337: Are like there l really don't know how you take it maybe you can help
17/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 879 2337: Because I did business studies so as to have knowledge on business on the program since there is also economics in the program but those with biology do not have the knowledge of business which is on the program
17/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: While I understand, you see Bachelor of science honors in Agriculture is a science degree itself.

Biology happens to be a crucial requirement for the same.
17/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 879 2337: Ooh ok so l can't do this program right
17/02/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Unfortunately your subject combination donot qualify for the same.
17/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Are you aware of Audrey from your school?
17/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Ohh ok so can u advice me of where l can qualify
17/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 879 2337: No
17/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 879 2337: You can refer me to him
17/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to Katsaura Vimbai Audrey, child of Mrs Mavis.
17/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Oook yuh l know her  but lknow her as Vimbai katsaura
17/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

She happened to have similar interests as of you, however her subjects didn't qualify for Bsc Agriculture as well.

After the counseling session she and Mrs Mavis realised how Bachelor in Geography will help her pursue her dreams!
17/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Shall I share more details with you?
17/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Yuh share with me
17/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
17/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.
