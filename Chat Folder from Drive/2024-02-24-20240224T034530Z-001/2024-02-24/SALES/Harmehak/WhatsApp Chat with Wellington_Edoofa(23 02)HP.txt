You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
23/02/24, 5:14 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Interesting
23/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 5:14 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes
23/02/24, 5:15 pm - +263 71 356 2036: It's what I have been looking for but couldn't seem to find
23/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Wellington, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
23/02/24, 5:16 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I will be glad to
23/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

23/02/24, 5:18 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I live in a small town in Zimbabwe called Norton.
23/02/24, 5:21 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I attended my Ordinary level at Serima High School located in Zimbabwe. This was a great 4 year period since as a large school, it diversified my social skills and ignited my love for soccer. This school charged $350 usd.
23/02/24, 5:25 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I changed schools, and I went to Emmanuel High School for my 2 years of Advanced Level. This was a great school as it helped in improving my leadership skills, through being a leader of clubs, and also becoming a Headboy during my final year.
23/02/24, 5:27 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I was born in a family of 5, being the second born. My father is currently a fire officer, and my mother a cook.
23/02/24, 5:28 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I hope it is okay, or there is more information to be added?
23/02/24, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Wellington, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

23/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
23/02/24, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study your desired course!
23/02/24, 5:47 pm - +263 71 356 2036: My love for computers started in primary school when I got my first laptop, since then I wanted everything to do with computers. In Ordinary Level I managed to do Computer Science as a practical subject and it increased my love for the subject. I passed my Ordinary level, and I managed to do the Subject in my Adavanced level. That was when realized that the way to satisfy my love for computers was to study Information Technology
23/02/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful, Wellington!
23/02/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you happen to research about your desired course?
23/02/24, 5:55 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Not that much, but about what it ventures into, which networks and software management to name a few. And also it has a great pay slip.
23/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

What are your thoughts on Physics being a mandatory requirement for Engineering, Wellington?
23/02/24, 6:22 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes I am aware
23/02/24, 6:22 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I thought it is under Computer Applicants , not engineering
23/02/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so why didn't you happen to pursue physics?
23/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: While Physics is a mandatory requirement for Engineering!

You are eligible to pursue Bachelor in Computer Applications and Bachelor of science in Computer science, please! <This message was edited>
23/02/24, 6:25 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I had a C in my Ordinary Level, and Physics is only offered to those with  A's
23/02/24, 6:25 pm - +263 71 356 2036: It is okay
23/02/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I can undertsand!
23/02/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: Which course shall I brief you about?
23/02/24, 6:27 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I am glad
23/02/24, 6:27 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Computer Applicants

23/02/24, 6:33 pm - +263 71 356 2036: thank you
23/02/24, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading please?
23/02/24, 6:36 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes I have
23/02/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So would you like to pursue the same?
23/02/24, 6:39 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes ma'am
23/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright Wellington, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 71 356 2036: When I finished reading the paragraph I understood that the course I first preferred and computer applications are basically in the same path, and it would still satisfy my love for computers. This will help me achieve my goal which is starting a computer-based firm, becoming the first in my family providing great motivation for my siblings. Due to the income of my family, things were not easy as I grew up and I would not want the same in the future for my family and me, and this scholarship opportunity would make a pivotal role.
23/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you understood the same!
23/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Wellington, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/02/24, 7:40 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Thank you
23/02/24, 7:45 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Clearly, Zimbabwe is not in a great economic situation as compared to India. I believe studying in India, a technologically developed country would equip me with enough ability and expertise to help with positively developing my country
23/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: You see, Wellington, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
23/02/24, 7:52 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes they are indeed
23/02/24, 7:52 pm - +263 71 356 2036: But it is my belief that a single person can make a difference
23/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Wellington.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?* <This message was edited>
23/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Through doing research, I noticed that India is one of the top countries offering high-quality education, making it a good destination for studies. Also the qualification degrees offered in India are recognized globally.
23/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: That's correct
23/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

23/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/02/24, 8:03 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I already see my face as one of the successful
23/02/24, 8:04 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes
23/02/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
23/02/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your knowledge?
23/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 71 356 2036: The ones I have seen so far range from 2000 to 3000 annually
23/02/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
23/02/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Thank you
23/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/02/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 8:07 pm - +263 71 356 2036: True
23/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 8:09 pm - +263 71 356 2036: That'll be great
23/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
23/02/24, 8:13 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Personally, I would say it is a great program, It gives the ability to those not able, and having such an opportunity would mean easing the pressure the parents face while having quality education. It will also add more advantages such as more time to study and keeps your min healthy
23/02/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement for the same, Wellington.
23/02/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: Wellington, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/02/24, 8:17 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I definitely agree
23/02/24, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Wellington.

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes I am ma'am
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Can you please tell me more about The Earn While You Learn Program
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/02/24, 8:31 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Perfectly explained, thank you
23/02/24, 8:31 pm - +263 71 356 2036: This makes me eager to study in India
23/02/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
23/02/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: We look forward to welcoming you!
23/02/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 8:33 pm - +263 71 356 2036: great to know
23/02/24, 8:34 pm - +263 71 356 2036: It'll be my pleasure to be a member of your institution
23/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, please!
23/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 8:39 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I definitely do
23/02/24, 8:39 pm - +263 71 356 2036: You allow the ability to apply an extra step
23/02/24, 8:40 pm - +263 71 356 2036: truly saying this is my first time hearing of such a program
23/02/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: That is great, I appreciate, Wellington,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/02/24, 8:42 pm - +263 71 356 2036: yes
23/02/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Wellington, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/02/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/02/24, 8:44 pm - +263 71 356 2036: 2150 - 2250
23/02/24, 8:44 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Which is a lot
23/02/24, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/02/24, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/02/24, 8:46 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Interesting indeed
23/02/24, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: Wellington, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/02/24, 8:47 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yess I do
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/02/24, 8:50 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Understood
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - +263 71 356 2036: So the payment is done after receiving the acceptance letter right?
23/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Correct, Wellington.
23/02/24, 8:52 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I believe we are still on step 2
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Okay
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - +263 71 356 2036: sorry 1
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Right now we are at Stage 1.
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Indeed.
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Yes
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/02/24, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/02/24, 8:55 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Understood
23/02/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/02/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/02/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 9:01 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I will gladly contact her
23/02/24, 9:01 pm - +263 71 356 2036: thanks
23/02/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.

Do connect your parents with her as well.
23/02/24, 9:02 pm - +263 71 356 2036: I surely will
23/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: So as of now would you like to ask anything?
23/02/24, 9:04 pm - +263 71 356 2036: Not now, I will definitely ask as I get some
23/02/24, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
23/02/24, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/02/24, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/02/24, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
