26/09/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
26/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 338 7852: He once told me that edoofa is an organization which is looking for students that are willing to persue with their tertiary education in india.It does not just take students but it looks for those that have passion,self disciplined and are able to aim higher goals
Edoofa is there to locate such students into 200+ universities across india.
26/09/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, and what else did you learn from him regarding his journey, his experiences please?
26/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 338 7852: He's enjoying being in India, there's no racism and people there are very welcome to every man
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that!
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
26/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 338 7852: I am glad to hear that too!
26/09/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
26/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yah sure.
26/09/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tinotenda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Morgan Heritage High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
26/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 338 7852: Tinotenda Dovi is my name, 23 years old ,upper six now at Morgan Heritage paying $150.00USD per term,I have 5 ordinary subjects passed including English, Mathematics,and Combined Science to mention few...i wish to study IT with Esoofa..My strength are as follows

*i have ability to follow institution from lecturers and other members of staff*

*i also have the ability to co-ordinate discussions and accept divergancy in ideas*

*ability to work and learn with a multi-cultural team of students*

However, my weakness is based on the fact that *i don't have ability to tolerate small minded ideas*

My father is a doctor and my mother is a teacher.

My hobbies are playing football and spent my time at social media.
26/09/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Well received Tinotenda, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please,

I can see you come from a well educated family, which I believe must have motivated you for higher education!
26/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 338 7852: Thank you😊
26/09/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Well Tinotenda, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
26/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i do with no doubt.
26/09/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
26/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yes I am mentally prepared
26/09/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, 

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
26/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yes they are aware of it.
26/09/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: That's great, Tinotenda,

Are they willing to support you mentally and financially as well?
26/09/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yes they do.
26/09/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
26/09/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
26/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 338 7852: Noted.
26/09/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, did you happen to take gap years during your studies please?
26/09/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i did, i wrote my ordinary level 2018 and go to work for three years and then i continue with my studies last year.
26/09/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Oh alright, and was there any specific reason for the same please?
26/09/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 338 7852: No it was my own willingness but later realized that education is the best foundation of life.
26/09/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please, Tinotenda!

So I believe now you are thoroughly dedicated to pursuing higher education please?
26/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes sure.
26/09/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study IT ?
26/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 338 7852: *Ordinary Level*

26/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 338 7852: There is no computer science at our and even in local schools but only to the expensive schools
26/09/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!

So did you also research about your desired course, Tinotenda?
26/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Later after i already decide to take Arts.
26/09/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!

26/09/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Tinotenda?
26/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i did
26/09/23, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
26/09/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i do
26/09/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tinotenda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
26/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 338 7852: it can be an equally exciting new chapter in my life that i make the most of my life with proper preparation.
26/09/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tinotenda, 

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
26/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Due to economic instability and violation of human rights in our country , i want to study abroad because of my own safety and to acquire better level of knowledge from your peaceful country without distubances.
26/09/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tinotenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
26/09/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yah sure.
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future,

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 338 7852: As i went through with my research via google, i've seen that many compliments are being said with African students about Edoofa are very interesting and also the ranking education of Edoofa is super profitable comparing to other Universities in this world, moreso as i grow up i wished to study in India because of the best movies and top ranking peaceful country so as i decide to choose Edoofa could be helpful in my life.
26/09/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see you have knowledge and awareness, Tinotenda!
26/09/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

26/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Interesting
26/09/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Tinotenda.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
26/09/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 338 7852: No we would like to know
26/09/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
26/09/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/09/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Ok
26/09/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/09/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/09/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Well affordable
26/09/23, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tinotenda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/09/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Awesome.
26/09/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
26/09/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes sure i agree
26/09/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Very well, and now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
26/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes and i really appreciate
26/09/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you and your parents!
26/09/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/09/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
26/09/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:
26/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 338 7852: It is very helpful as i see😊
26/09/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

26/09/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/09/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Noted.
26/09/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i can realise it now
26/09/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

Tinotenda, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
26/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes i am.
26/09/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
26/09/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/09/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 338 7852: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 338 7852: *$1 500 to $2 250*
26/09/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/09/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
26/09/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Very affordable
26/09/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/09/23, 7:58 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes sure i do think so.
26/09/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/09/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
26/09/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 71 338 7852: That's fair.
26/09/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
26/09/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
26/09/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
26/09/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Very well.
26/09/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/09/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
26/09/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
26/09/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Ok
26/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Noted
26/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Well nice working
26/09/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
26/09/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
26/09/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please.
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Will get in touch with her when she's online...i just leave the greeting message
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Thank you
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
26/09/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: So far would you like to ask anything please?
26/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Ok i will do so.
26/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 338 7852: As for *Bachelor in Computer Applications* how many advanced level points should i come up with.
26/09/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

However we encourage our students to give their best!
26/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Ok as for now that is it but if i have some questions i will get in touch.
26/09/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Tinotenda!
26/09/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
26/09/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/09/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

04/10/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/10/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/10/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/10/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th October 2023 for $200 and the 9th or 10th of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th of October 2023.
04/10/23, 1:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same? @27736521708 @263786282449

05/10/23, 7:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Tinotendo, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Tinotenda's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
05/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 628 2449: Yes sure
06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good evening,

06/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 628 2449: I'm good and you
06/10/23, 5:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tinotenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tinotenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it ? @263786282449

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
13/10/23, 10:36 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.

22/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tinotenda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

22/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Wow I really appreciate some of evidence you are Sharing, it builds trust between me and my parents and Edoofa as well
22/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
22/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall your friend Panashe?
22/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes yes sure I really miss him, I lost his contact 💔
22/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

I believe you must be aware he is currently in India?
22/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Yes sure.
22/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

22/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda,  by when shall I expect to hear from your parents?
22/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Definitely by end of this week I'll let you know
22/02/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 71 338 7852: Like I said earlier that my father is in UK and my mother is here in Zimbabwe so I need proper time to discuss with both of them and the other reason is that they are always busy but I'll try by all cost to talk with them concerning this issue before the end of this week then I'll tell you what they've said, thank you.
