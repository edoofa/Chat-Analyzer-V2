22/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Well ! 
Thank you madam
22/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading please?
22/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Yes Ms Harmehak
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright Timothy, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/02/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Well thank you for the great opportunity.

First if i am provided with this career option I see myself in a position were I will live a better life and become someone who will help people with healthy problems .....and if i get into Edoofa's Program ,it enable me to achieve my goals by providing good learning environment, ..by offering me a 100% scholarship and accommodation ..Also by providing part time Jobs...
22/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright!

However, may I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship?
22/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Well ..
You can help me on this point ...I have no idea
22/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 885 8786: To assist on that one by him saying 100% scholarship he is trying to say the scholarship covers all his academic fees and accomodations as a whole during the course.
22/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Well.
Noted
22/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.
22/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 885 8786: So it means once you become notched in the 50-100% tuition scholarship you have to look for accomodation and the remainder of the tuition fees?
22/02/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: The parents provide the support for the remaining expenses please.
22/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 885 8786: Noted
22/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: As of you would recall earlier I happened to ask Timothy if the parents are willing to support his higher education financially.
22/02/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 885 8786: Yes
22/02/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Tanyanyiwa, are you willing to support his higher education here in India both mentally and financially?
22/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 885 8786: Yes
22/02/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!
22/02/24, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Timothy, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Well ...I need better education and better learning conditions
22/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: You see, Timothy, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
22/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 583 2237: True
22/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
22/02/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 583 2237: I researched and find that India is a stable country and has less political issues ..Also Indian Educational System provides programs which assist students in following their dreams ..for example earn while learning program. Moreover, after obtaining a diploma one can work in that country.
22/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your knowledge.
22/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

22/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Timothy?
22/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Yes
22/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 583 2237: No
22/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
22/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Noted
22/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Weĺl I thought it's good for dreamers and also it's good for giving students the opportunity to earn while learning
22/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So now given the costs and opportunities,

Are your parents willing to support you financially?
22/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 885 8786: Yes
22/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Ok Ms
22/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

They did it !
22/02/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, I will also connect you to a parent who has children in India.

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
22/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Understood madam
22/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Ok
22/02/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Timothy, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/02/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 583 2237: $1500-$2250
22/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Ok
22/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Timothy, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/02/24, 4:48 pm - +263 78 583 2237: .ok
22/02/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: So now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/02/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/02/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Understood
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
22/02/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/02/24, 5:13 pm - +263 78 583 2237: Understood
22/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

22/02/24, 5:58 pm - +263 77 885 8786: Thanks for your help
22/02/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

22/02/24, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please.
22/02/24, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
22/02/24, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
