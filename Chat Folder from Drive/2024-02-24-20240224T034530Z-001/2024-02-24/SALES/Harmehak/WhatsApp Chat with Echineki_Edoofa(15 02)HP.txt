17/02/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 950 7819: Ok...I understand Edoofa Scholarship Program as a a program that helps African students in their studies with affordable and quality education and also some advantages as compared to other Scholarships from UK because it as what you call Earn while you learn
17/02/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Well received, Echineki, let me share more about the program with you.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/02/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

17/02/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 950 7819: Wow that's awesome
17/02/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
17/02/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
17/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 950 7819: Yes, surely.
17/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 950 7819: It is
17/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Echineki, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Herman Gmeiner charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
17/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 950 7819: Well,l am a boy aged 18 turning 19 on the 27th of November this year.We are four boys in my family,l being the first born son. My father works in the marketing department at Ok Zimbabwe limited ,Bindura. My mother is a housewife. Both of my parents ended their studies at Ordinary level whereby my father obtained 5 Ordinary level subjects and above and also my mother had 4 Ordinary level subjects. 

At Hermann Gmeiner,l am charged $231 per term.Whereby due to the number of responsibilities my father has to serve with the money he earns it's irrational. Which makes the reason why l had to find a way to help him carry his lead while l proceed with my studies as l also have goals to achieve.

I am a self-driven, disciplined, intelligent, hardworking and understanding boy. I am a very responsible young man with ambition to learn new things so as to become a business man in time.

I did my Ordinary level and managed to obtain all of them l had sat for which are eight ,with  3A's and  5's which was not my best given the conditions to do more than that.At Advanced level l am doing Pure Mathematics, Geography and Crop Science.Of all the subjects,l have very much strength in Geography because l love it so much making it the reason why l am hunting for a mining vacancy .If things go the other way ,l also have passion in specialing with in the Crops field.
I am very good volleyball player and also the best chess player of the moment at my school.
17/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Echineki, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
17/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 950 7819: Thank you so much,Mam
17/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 950 7819: Sorry Mam,here l meant 3A's and 5B's
17/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
17/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Could you please share your results in a picture format?

17/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 950 7819: <Media omitted>
17/02/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Received please
17/02/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Well Echineki now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
17/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 950 7819: I don't think it is a life changing decision,l think it is just the same with being in your country   because l would also be on a  boarding University. Also,l had no permanent decisions for my life yet ,l was still figuring out which way l can take to pursue my goals. So l just have to find what to do when l study abroad in order to be whom l want to be in the near future
17/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I can understand, Echineki!

However, you would agree that living in different countries is different than living in your own country's boarding school please?
17/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 950 7819: Yes,of course Mam
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
17/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 950 7819: Yes
17/02/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Echineki, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
17/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 950 7819: Well,l think my parents are willing to support me mentally as l can see my father's number was added in this group and yesterday he was asking me to relax  and start the discussion with you when l am comfortable and as for finance l am not sure  but l think they will try....
17/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 378 2425: Good day Ms Haemehak.
I am following your conversation with my son Echineki and I support this boy without hesitation knowing that he is a self motivated student since primary level.
17/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 378 2425: Though I am financially struggling but mentally I always supporting him.
17/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
17/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Duly received Mr Terence, I appreciate your acknowledgement.

However would you agree that higher education would require financial support?
17/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 950 7819: Thank you
17/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: What is your financial planning for your higher education, Echineki?
17/02/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 950 7819: Okay .l was planning that,l will find something to do like a job or anything that gives me money in order to add on what my parents have for them not to stress too much on me since they have some other children to cater for besides me
17/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
17/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Echineki, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
17/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 950 7819: Yes, l do agree with you
17/02/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: So what is your thought on the affordability for higher edcucation in  Zimbabwe?
17/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 378 2425: Yes, I do agree with you.
17/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 378 2425: I am trying by all means to support him. It's only a matter that I am earning a little but it seems I am limiting this guy's dreams
17/02/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 950 7819: In Zimbabwe,higher education is a bit expensive as compared to higher education in some other countries and also sometimes there's  lack of equipment needed
17/02/24, 5:30 pm - +263 77 950 7819: Though people say it is of quality as compared to some other African countries
18/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 950 7819: Good morning Mam
22/02/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
