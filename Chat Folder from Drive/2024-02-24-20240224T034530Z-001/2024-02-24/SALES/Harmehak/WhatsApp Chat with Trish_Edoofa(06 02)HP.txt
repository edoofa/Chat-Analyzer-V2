07/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
07/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
07/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 308 7310: Yes Ms Harmehak it's very true
07/02/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Trish, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Wise owl high school charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 71 308 7310: I am Trish Tendai Zvomuya and l am 22 years old and l am turning 23 on the 18th of February. So my journey as a student hasn't been easy due to financial instabilities. My parents are divorced so l live with my Mom only and she carters for everything. I wrote my Ordinary level examinations in 2019 and l passed all then 10 Zim sec subjects
07/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 71 308 7310: My Mom lost her job immediately and l had to struggle to go to Advanced level until l got a scholarship at wise owl due to music and l wrote my Cambridge examinations last year and l have ten points in maths, Biology and Chemistry. I woukd like to study medicine if l get the priviledge to. I am a very emotional person and l am slow in doing things physically but mentally l am a fast learner. I love reading books, listening to music, practicing music and socialization
07/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 71 308 7310: My Mom used to be a supervisor at Dominican convent's sports club and as for my Father, he is an electrician but like l said my parents are divorced. My Mom holds a diploma in mortician and for my father holds a diploma in electrical engineering. As for my Father he does not support us financially. Right now my Mom is not working
07/02/24, 10:56 am - +263 71 308 7310: As for siblings l have two siblings. The one that follows after me is a girl aged 18 who is at home due a financial situation that we have faced,, she hasn't collected her Cambridge results for the exams she wrote in 2022. After the girl is a boy who is the last born,, he is in form 1 right now
07/02/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Trish, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!


I appreciate your mother's support despite the financial challenges, Trish.
Its good to know that you could complete A level because of music.
07/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Ms Harmehak for listening to my issue, l am grateful 🙏🏻
07/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
07/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Trish, I would like to have a better understanding considering your financial support for higher education please!

Would you agree that higher education would require financial and mental support from your parents?
07/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 308 7310: I agree Ms Harmehak
07/02/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: So may I know regarding your financial support and preparation for your Higher education, Trish?
07/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Mom, l am stuck for now Ms Harmehak l am looking forward for an opportunity to get a scholarship that will cover my tuition fees and for the accommodation l would like a reasonable one Ma'am and also l would like to work and whilst schooling so that l can fund my education and my family
07/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: While I do understand, Trish!

You cannot work in India on a student visa please.
07/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay Ma'am, but is there a chance that l can get a full scholarship on tuition
07/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: While we do offer 100% scholarship on Tuition, Trish!

What is your planning for the remaining expenses?
07/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you on that Ma'am, l was thinking of finding funds to help us out with these remaining expenses that is if l get the priviledge of the scholarship
07/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, 

However, did you discuss with your mother, Trish?
07/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes ma'am l discussed this issue with my Mom but currently she is stuck as well and we hope and pray she will get employed soon, this is why l was looking for a full funded scholarship
07/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Trish?
07/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Ma'am, l think a fully funded scholarship is that one which covers you on the tuition and other remaining expenses
07/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/02/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay Ma'am thank you for enlightening on that one.
07/02/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I prefer to have a scholarship than a sponsorship because they are difficult to get.
07/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: We donot offer sponsorship itself please!
07/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay Ma'am, it's alright. I am reading for the scholarship
07/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
07/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I am ready to take the scholarship if given the priviledge
07/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Trish!

However what is your financial planning for the remaining expenses?
07/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Ms Harmehak, first l think l have to know how expensive it is to stay in India and all the expenses. If l get the scholarship then for the first month my Mom's sister will help us out up until my Mom gets a job.
07/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and we will thoroughly discuss the financial aspect as well, Trish!
07/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes thank you Maam
07/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!

Trish, could you please share your O and A level results in a picture format with me?
07/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 71 308 7310: It's alright Maam
07/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 308 7310: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: I have received your O level results please.
07/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh alright Ms Harmehak
07/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 308 7310: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
07/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Trish you happened to mention you wish to study Medicine!

May I know more regarding the same?

What motivates you to study Medicine and what all did you research regarding the same?
07/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes Ma'am.I want to study medicine because of passion and other two situations l faced. So the first one is when l got sick in 2016, l had a problem similar to epilepsy. I was helped by the people l don't know and l thought that l really need to pay these people back by helping others who are in need of medical help.
The second situation is about my cousin who died in 2019. My cousin had a heart problem  that troubled her for a long time and she died and l didn't help me. My family situation motivates me as well
07/02/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: I am sorry for your loss, Trish.
07/02/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 308 7310: It's okay Ma'am, thank you.
07/02/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Trish, were you also able to research about the requirements of Medicine?
07/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I was not able to research on that die to lack of access to internet but l got some guidelines from someone who works in the medical field and as of today l will get the full details Ma'am, thank you for asking
07/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Trish.
07/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you
07/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Ma'am so does this mean if l have studied maths, Biology and Chemistry l might not get a place in the program
07/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
07/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh alright Maam
07/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything, Trish?
07/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Ma'am may l please have full detail of the program which is on number 6
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Sure, please.

However, before the same let me share a few details.
07/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes Ma'am,l would like to ask on that program which is on number 6
07/02/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Now, if a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in the field it is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
07/02/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**

07/02/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Trish!
07/02/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright Trish, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/02/24, 6:35 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I would like to ask how many years do l finish the program
07/02/24, 6:35 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I also have a question concerning the Cardiovascular program will it help to go to the medicine program
07/02/24, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: Medical Laboratory Technology is a three years degree.
07/02/24, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: Medical Laboratory Technology will be able to help regarding the same itself please.
07/02/24, 6:53 pm - +263 71 308 7310: The first three years obviously l will be doing the program. I see myself helping others with the knowledge of Edoofians and life in general. Then l after graduation l will move to my dream degree. I believe in myself that at this point in time l will be a great woman strong enough to tackle any problem and l also believe that l will be an example to the future Edoofians and my fellow colleagues that year
07/02/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Trish, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/02/24, 7:02 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you, l would like to ask, how many years will l do the medicine program after doing the medical laboratory technology
07/02/24, 7:03 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you on that note, Zimbabwe has two universities with the medicine facility that is university of Zimbabwe and Nust. The competition for the universities is real and we have a lot of Zimbabweans who did not get the opportunity to learn in the medical field and they had to select other programs which are not of their choice. I want to study abroad so that l will learn not only academically but also socially and mentally. I want to see how people from different backgrounds and countries interact and share their cultures
07/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

07/02/24, 7:34 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Wow that is amazing, thank you Ms Harmehak for sharing this information
07/02/24, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes we are familiar, we have been researching on it
07/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

Could you please share your knowledge?
07/02/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 8:33 pm - +263 71 308 7310: The medicine programs costs  from around 5500 per year and 2750 per semester then to the countries that use Euros its around 26000
07/02/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did research, Trish!
07/02/24, 8:41 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh alrighy
07/02/24, 8:41 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Alright Maam
07/02/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Trish, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
07/02/24, 8:44 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Alright then thank you so much
07/02/24, 8:44 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I would like to ask if you offer jobs if we are done with our programs
07/02/24, 8:47 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I believe that my performance will be of a higher standard sta
07/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
07/02/24, 8:53 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes l see now what an amazing country
07/02/24, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Trish!

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/02/24, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you all, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs.

08/02/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Trish!

Are you aware of Edoofa's association with Dominican Convent?
08/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 308 7310: Oh no Ma'am, may you please enlighten me on that
08/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 308 7310: Downloading, does this mean this year's seminar is going to held at Dominican Convent
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: The details are yet to be confirmed.

However the expected venue is Martin Luther King, school.
08/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 308 7310: It's okay Ma'am, may you please inform me if the venue is confirmed
08/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: I will please!
08/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 308 7310: Thank you Maam
08/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Just like Shammah from Wise Owl, we have Tadiwanashe Leilani Choto from Dominican Convent currently in India too!

08/02/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

08/02/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the same?
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Since l am not at home we have suggested to discuss it together and we find means to get the money for other expenses Maam
08/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Trish!

However is she willing to support you with finances please?
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 308 7310: She is willing to help Maam
08/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Trish!
08/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Trish, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I agree to Mr Piyush's observation it is very true
08/02/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Trish?
08/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes l am in a better position Ma'am thanks to you for helping the less priviledged students
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Wow that's amazing, l see myself on the advertisement board☺️in the next 5 years
08/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Trish!
08/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay then l get it
08/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/02/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
08/02/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow, Trish?
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I didn't know Ms Harmehak and l am happy to know this
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 71 308 7310: I get it Ma'am. Yes l am ready
08/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Trish, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 308 7310: 15000to 2000 dollars
08/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 71 308 7310: How sure am l guaranteed that if l pay that amount l am a fully member of Edoofa
08/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/02/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 308 7310: This is great
08/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Okay Ma'am
08/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Wow that is a very good payment plan
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Yes Maam
08/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 308 7310: On that note, may you please explain what will be in the test and possible questions
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Those general test and question related to your education so far!
08/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay then
08/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Oh okay l get it
08/02/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

08/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Wow that's great
08/02/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

08/02/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

09/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 308 7310: Section 5
 To a greater extent, Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient farms. The first cause is due to poor soils I  some parts that are not able to produce more yields that is for example in deserts, there is lack of adequate rain that is needed to help the crops to grow  and produce large yields needed 
by people to survive. In other areas, poor rain is available but not adequate to help the plants grow leading to plant death hence poor diet that may lead to more diseases like malnutrition.  However, to a lesser  extent, in  Developing Countries the economy affects the yield of farms to an extent. There is need of resources for every farmer that is fertilizers, insecticides and herbicides to help control diseases that may affect the crops leading to crops dying and also not ripening fully and also plant death leading to a poor diet. To other farmers, they depend on farming and they don't have any other jobs to support their families therefore the lack of money and raw materials leads to poor diets and poverty. In addition to this, not all African countries provide resources and financial support to farmers therefore it leads to a poor diet since the people depend on their produce. Furthermore, lack of unity between other countries leads to this poor diets since they are supposed to be supporting each other through import and export.

My Inspirational story

It's true when they miracles live here on earth for the glory of the Lord to be seen, l am a that miracle. I remember sitting for my Zimsec ordinary level examinations in 2017 very happy that l am about to cross the main bridge that holds my future. I wrote my exams with courage and hope from family and friends and above all God standing by my side. In 2018, our results were outs and l was excited since my friends  had passed and to me it  was obvious that l had good results not knowing that the fate is different. This was the worst moment in my life and it felt like l was in hell. I had failed my Ordinary levels and l had three subjects which were Mathematics, commerce and science. I lost friends and those who were close to me but thanks to my  Mom, Dad and siblings that stood with me. Second term. Of the same year, l got a scholarship for music in a mission school and l decided to start again without fear. It was not an easy journey as people said a lot of hurtful words about me and l was a given a name that was a Repeater. This moved me to greater heights and l started working hard. With the help of God and guidance from few people l passed my Ordinary level. The devil was not yet done, trying to bring shame in my life but God kept all his promises. My Mom lost her job in 2021 and l had to stay at home. My Mom tried to make ends meet for me to proceed to Advanced Level but things were not well since l had a sibling who was writing in 2022 and we had necessities we had to take care of. I felt like the world was coming to an end and l was shattered but God never left my side. In 2022 in the month of March, l got a scholarship at wise owl one of the most expensive schools. That moment was not easy for me because l felt like it was a dream but no that 21 year old was now going to fulfill her dreams. I got enrolled there and l felt God's grace love. God fulfilled everything l wanted in the past and l got it. I got a priviledge of being a prefect leading the cultural side of the school. Fast forward to 2023,l wrote my Cambridge  advance level examinations and l passed. My Mom was there for me to cheer me up and was and is still proud of me. God is able to do just what he said he will do, who would ever think that a 22 year old will write her Advance level and pass but l am  here a miracle and what l know is that l will continue to be a miracle

15/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Yes please!

Did you happen to have a thorough discussion with Trish regarding the program?
15/02/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 859 3297: Yes ma'am
15/02/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: These are the details as addressed by Trish, kindly go through the same.

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?
Medical Laboratory Technology

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?
India

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?
$6000-8000

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?
$1200-1800

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 
$350

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?
7 days

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
Yes
15/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 859 3297: Oh okay. Everything is clear.
15/02/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: So, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Trish's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
15/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 859 3297: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/02/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/02/24, 10:13 am - +263 71 859 3297: The EWYL Program is a relief to both Trish and l. Im very much grateful for all your offers,they make things easy. Trish will perform well and l will work extra hard to support  her as required.
15/02/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I appreciate the same!
15/02/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with Mrs Ruth too?
15/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 71 859 3297: Unfortunately no. Let me quickly do that though Trish's help
15/02/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
15/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/02/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 859 3297: This is very encouraging and promising. I can surely trust you all with the hope that Trish will succescfully get enrolled too.
15/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 859 3297: Thank you.
I have sent her a message.
15/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: I appreciate the same!
15/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
15/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
15/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
15/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 859 3297: Yes, l'm willing to support her to the fullest as required. And l will always cooperate, communicating even when l experience any hardships
15/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 859 3297: Edoofa Program is a very good program. My faith is getting stronger, for everything is clear and worth trusting.
15/02/24, 11:02 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
15/02/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
15/02/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.
