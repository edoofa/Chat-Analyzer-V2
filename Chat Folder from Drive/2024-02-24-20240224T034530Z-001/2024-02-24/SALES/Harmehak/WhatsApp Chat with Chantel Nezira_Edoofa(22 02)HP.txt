I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Hamilton high charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

22/02/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Yes please.
22/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 764 1229: First and foremost most Thank you for the opportunity of assisting me. 

To begin with I would like to state my name, I am Chantel Nezira. A young lady of the age 19. It has always been my greatest desire to persue my education abroad and especially in India as it offers the best education and produces one of the most well known and reputable people in both  the medical industry and technological industry e.g  Dr.Siddhartha Mukherjee,  Dr. Naresh Trehan and Dr. Gaurav Kharya just to mention a few. Bearing this in mind the fire within me of standing a chance to be educated in the precious country India has always been a perfectly burning one.

When it comes to strengths and weaknesses there is a lot to mention but just to mention a few. I have grown to discover that I am a very attentive person and detail oriented, I have become a very collaborative; creative and patient individual due to the great exposure I have had as the Deputy Headgirl of my former school. I am good at delegating tasks and also I'm a critical thinker which has really helped me in my problem solving abilities. I prioritize time and hence proper time management has become a part of who I am. 
As a person you will never be perfect and here are my imperfections : I tend to be a competitive person from time to time, giving myself a hard time and deadlines to get things done, I also have fear of failure. Having mentioned this i would love to also give a brief background about my family. 
  
Born as the last born in a family of 6 but now 5 due to the loss of my father I am one of the two girls having 2 brothers. My mother works as a accounts Clerk, my brother as a soldier, my other brother is still at school and my sister is married. Highest level of education at the moment A'level. 
 
During my spare time I like to sing, exercise and also learn more about python and cyber since I desire to venture into tech

At my former school I used to pay 100USD per term and 30usd special levy once a year.
22/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Chantel, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

I am sorry for the loss of your father.
22/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 764 1229: That's very kind, I appreciate it
22/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome.
22/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your mother's support and I can see you yourself have a great personality willing to do well and your leadership skills are admirable!
22/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Thank you so much
22/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Well Chantel now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
22/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes indeed I believe it's a life changing decision
22/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I believe it has a lot to offer. From opening new doors for career all the way to installing a greater sense of independence and essentially expanding one's world veiw.
22/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Well put across!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
22/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes I am very much mentally prepared for all that life has to offer and yes that includes starting a life abroad
22/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Chantel, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your mother is willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
22/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I believe she is very much willing to support as long as the finances aren't shocking to her as she is the only one supporting me. <This message was edited>

cii) How much is the Enrollment fee for the Edoofa Scholarship Program?

Ans:$200-$350

d) Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program? (Ans in 50-100 words)

Answer : I believe I deserve the scholarship because I am an innovative problem solver and critical thinker with a sober mind.As the vice Head girl of my former school it was me sole priority to ensure that bullying was seriously torn down. Students suffered from trauma and some fear and some had destroyed self esteem due to others who thoughts they were better. In unity with the senior women and there along with my senior prefect we established a group and regular antiviolence campaigns that helped deal with the issue at hand reducing the bullying reports and also proving counseling sessions for those affected creating a more peaceful environment that helped students to believe in themselves more and persue their ultimate life goals in academics with less hindrance from other peers. My goal is not only to persue a degree in medicine but to also aid people who have been emotionally and socially abused. With this scholarship and the need-based grants I will receive, I can complete my education and also continue organizing campaigns and opening communities where people are free to be assisted medically and socially.

22/02/24, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright Chantel, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 764 1229: To be honest this would be a life changing opportunity for me, my family and community at large.
I not only want to earn a better living for myself but I also want to develop better systems for the world which will not only be available for the rich but also the less privileged. I want to establish an application for tracing health status etc, there's really a lot hopefully I'll gain more knowledge as I learn more about the program
22/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Its my dream to open a non profitable organization which will be providing education for young people who have the same interest but due to financial issues they are hindered.
22/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Chantel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your noble thoughts!
22/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I believe studying abroad is a better choice than studying in my home country because firstly I would like to mention the issue of having less equipment and shortage of optimum facilities for students to grow more of their practical skills as our country is  still developing. Secondly not only does studying abroad broaden oneself to learn new cultures, tradition, customs and other global issues but it also assists in allowing oneself to grow, mature their world veiw aiding in sharpening ones way of thinking.
22/02/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: You see, Chantel, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
22/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes that's true the issue of getting jobs is stressful you can really graduate and celebrate after that you stay for 5 good years without a job, this has led to a rise in the number of people suffering from depression, high blood pressure, stroke etc. It's so bad even for those working because employees here are underpaid.
22/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Now even going to university is difficult because some of our parents do not earn enough despite the hard work they do at work, spending over time just to be paid a few cents
22/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct and I can see you understand the situation.
22/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: While I am also glad that you looking for maximum exposure and willing to make efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
22/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I discovered that there is the Earn While You Learn system which enables  students to earn money to finance their higher education. Allowing students to also gain practical knowledge and nature their skills.
The networking opportunities are also a plus since there will be students from various countries as well as professionals which will expand one's professional global connections.
22/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Thats wonderful, Chantel!
22/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

22/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 764 1229: This is so motivating
22/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 764 1229: There's really a lot that Indian people have established
22/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 764 1229: No we are not
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 764 1229: That's far beyond our means, unbelievable
22/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai
22/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Chantel, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
22/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai I understand
22/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai
22/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
22/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Alright
22/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai that's better
22/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
22/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Chantel, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 764 1229: It's honestly better considering how high it initially was. It's actually very wonderful what you do, offering chances to those who wouldn't have managed
22/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please.
22/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I do agree, yes tuition this side can be as high as 1440usd a year not including accommodations and other requirements
22/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Chantel.

I am glad you have a thorough knowledge and awareness!
22/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Thank you ma'am
22/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/02/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Wow there's so much to be offered
22/02/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Chantel
22/02/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai ma'am I understand
22/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 764 1229: It's actually very much helpful I see
22/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Causing less strain on the family
22/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: That's exactly the motive, Chantel!
22/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/02/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Congratulations to him, okay so it's now up to you  to say okai I'm going to work extra hard and you actually reap what you sore
22/02/24, 4:54 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Sorry ma'am my battery died, but it's now okai
22/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 764 1229: This is really an eye opener to more indeed
22/02/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
22/02/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
22/02/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes ma'am
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Chantel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/02/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 764 1229: $1500-$2250 <This message was edited>
22/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/02/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai
22/02/24, 5:05 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai
22/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Owww okay
22/02/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Chantel, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/02/24, 5:08 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okay wonderful
22/02/24, 5:08 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I do
22/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/02/24, 5:11 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Alright
22/02/24, 5:12 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Just the enrollment fee
22/02/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
22/02/24, 5:13 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I'm saying this is money for just the enrollment fee
22/02/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: It's paid in two installments after you are found eligible and you receive an Acceptance letter.
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes thank you understood
22/02/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai
22/02/24, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/02/24, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/02/24, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/02/24, 5:16 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Okai

22/02/24, 5:18 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Yes
22/02/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/02/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/02/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

22/02/24, 5:31 pm - +263 77 764 1229: Wow that's great
22/02/24, 5:31 pm - +263 77 764 1229: I think everything was just made clear

23/02/24, 8:54 am - +263 77 764 1229: 11AM sharp
23/02/24, 8:56 am - Harmehak: Alright please
23/02/24, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
23/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 764 1229: Yes
23/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So, how was the discussion as a family Chantel?

What all did you happen to discuss?
23/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 764 1229: The question mom had a few questions like how does it go about with the flights and accommodation on semester break
23/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 764 1229: She can't participate now she is at work
23/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
23/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Chantel, let me help you have better clarity about the same please.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
23/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: So even in your breaks you stay at campus itself while exploring the country too!
23/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 764 1229: Owww okai thank you
23/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 764 1229: Then the tickets
23/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 764 1229: Flights
23/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
23/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 764 1229: Alright well understood
23/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: So have you and your mother already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future..
23/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 764 1229: Yes mother communicated with her
23/02/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
23/02/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Did you also happen to connect with Abigail?
23/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 764 1229: Yes I did inbox her
23/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 764 1229: I have another question
23/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 764 1229: What determines if one is going to get 50%  or  80%
23/02/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
23/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 764 1229: Alright

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

The topic of food insecurity in Africa is a complex and multifaceted issue. Many factors contribute to food insecurity in Africa, including political instability, lack of infrastructure, lack of access to resources, and the effects of climate change. In my essay I will focus specifically on the impact of poor farming practices on food insecurity in Africa.

While there are a number of factors that contribute to food insecurity in Africa, poor farming practices play a significant role in the problem. These practices can be attributed to a lack of resources, such as land, water, and labor, as well as a lack of knowledge and training in modern agricultural.

In a nutshell poor farming practices are a major contributor to food insecurity in Africa. Addressing this issue will require a multi-pronged approach that takes into account the unique challenges and opportunities that exist in different regions of Africa. With the right support and resources, farming practices can be improved and food insecurity can be reduced.

When I think about what has inspired me the most in my life, I can't help but think of my mother. My mother have always been my greatest inspiration, and has taught me so much about hard work, perseverance, and determination. She raised me in this country with nothing, and through her hard work and dedication, she was able to build a better life for me and our family. I have learned from her example that anything is possible if you are willing to put in the effort and never give up. She has always been there for me, supporting me in everything I do.
