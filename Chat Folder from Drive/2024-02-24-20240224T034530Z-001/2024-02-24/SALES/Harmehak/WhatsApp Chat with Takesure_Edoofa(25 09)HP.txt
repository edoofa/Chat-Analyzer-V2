As my mother and l suggested , Edoofa is the last hope open to us , in provision for quality and affordable education .The reason why l choose or why l want a scholarship from you , is that here in Zimbabwe with our low income l can barely undertake a good program of my dreams due to high costs , further more l want to be someone who contribute to the rising of all my fellow family members and the country at large .I figured out that this can only be achieved by determination , focus and an unceasing hard work  as well as attaining the best education on a better University 





In a nutshell , Edoofa is there to assist us achieve our vision , goals , dreams as well as some experience that come along with the scholarship .

07/10/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Alright Takesure, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 728 1655: In five years, after acquiring a BBA degree, I might see myself working in a variety of different roles in the business world. I might be working as a business analyst, helping companies to make better decisions based on data. I might be working as a marketing specialist, helping companies to create and execute marketing plans. Or I might be working as a consultant, helping companies to improve their operations , designing IT requirements of businesses , l might  be someone transforming the business world through lCT . No matter what I end up doing, I know that my BBA degree will give me the skills and knowledge to be successful.
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That is really great Takesure, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 728 1655: There are several reasons l choose to study for a BBA degree in India rather than in Zimbabwe. For one, India has a much more developed economy and business sector, so there are likely to be more opportunities for jobs and internships in India. Additionally, India has a number of prestigious universities that offer BBA programs, which can provide students with a high-quality education. Finally, the cost of living and studying in India is generally lower than in Zimbabwe, so it may be more affordable to pursue a BBA degree in India.
07/10/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: You see, Takesure, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
07/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 728 1655: That's true , it's painful
07/10/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I can understand, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Takesure!
07/10/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

07/10/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed, Takesure!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 728 1655: No
07/10/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/10/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/10/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

How are you doing today ?
11/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Im so great how are you doing today
11/10/23, 3:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: .
11/10/23, 3:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: -**let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/10/23, 3:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Yes
11/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's great to know. Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Yes l have a little idea
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
11/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 548 5366: Understood
11/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 548 5366: Good afternoon , on my own perspective , this might be very beneficial to my child
11/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 548 5366: That's intresting .Thank you
11/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Interesting 🤝
11/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Hello
11/10/23, 6:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
11/10/23, 6:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
11/10/23, 6:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
11/10/23, 6:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

11/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 728 1655: 1
11/10/23, 9:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.

17/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 548 5366: $750- $1000
17/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 548 5366: Is it possible to just apply on one or two universities
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What if you apply at 2 universities and both reject your application will you able to afford one year that will be wasted ?
17/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 728 1655: How are you
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Definitely no
17/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Okay understood
17/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Sometimes , but no
17/10/23, 2:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Yes l think so
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 728 1655: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Okay
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Yes l know something about it
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 728 1655: Yes all clear
17/10/23, 3:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
17/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 728 1655: 5 SOP s will range approximately $600 -$ 1000 , including the application fee it will be around $ 1350-1500
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

21/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 364 4482: Not all of them
21/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 364 4482: I would like to understand more about the visa , transport costs
21/10/23, 12:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If you study in Zimbabwe will University of Zimbabwe pay for your transportation fees ?
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 364 4482: All clear , no
21/10/23, 2:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How much will one pay if he has to university daily by bus or van in Zimbabwe?
21/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 364 4482: $2-$3 daily
21/10/23, 8:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How much thats annually if student has to travel 300 days a year ?
21/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 364 4482: Good evening
21/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 364 4482: $600-$900
22/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 548 5366: Good morning
22/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 364 4482: Good morning
22/10/23, 9:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: That way more than the flight fare to India
22/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 364 4482: Okay
22/10/23, 9:30 am - Sahil Edoofa: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$590, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
22/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 364 4482: Understood
22/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 364 4482: All clear
22/10/23, 11:30 am - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
22/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 364 4482: Yes we connected with her and we are still discussing but so far she said that without Edoofa she was not going to make it ,, I and my son we called her and she explained how  she raised money for each semester and how she passed all the processes
22/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 364 4482: She said that
22/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 364 4482: She faced no challenges at all
22/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 364 4482: She illustrated the visa and ticket price
22/10/23, 1:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
22/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 364 4482: Sure
22/10/23, 2:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023!

22/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes ?
22/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 364 4482: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th October 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th  of October 2023.

30/10/23, 9:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
30/10/23, 9:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
