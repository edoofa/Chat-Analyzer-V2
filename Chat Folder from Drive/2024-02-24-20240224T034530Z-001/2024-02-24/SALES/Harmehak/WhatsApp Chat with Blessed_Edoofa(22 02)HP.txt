*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Blessed Mazambani.
22/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Good morning
22/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Blessed, before we proceed ahead can you please share all your learnings regarding the details of the program from the Seminar?

22/02/24, 5:41 pm - ~ mehak edoofa added +263 78 603 9720
22/02/24, 5:52 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Ok ma'am, during the seminar I learned various important things about the program. Firstly I got to know about the enrollment fee to the Edoofa program which is $350 and must be paid before the 26th of February. The country I will be pursuing my studies is India which is known for high quality universities that provides higher standards worldwide.

I also learned that most universities in India have higher tuition fees but thanks to Edoofa scholarship program the tuition has been greatly reduced and due to the scholarship credits and our parents will have to pay between $1600 to $2300 tuition fee annually for the engineering programs.

This fee will include accommodation and food to the student. The student can also join the Earn While you Learn program which also enables the student to help the parents in paying the tuition fee.

All thanks to the counselors who grant us the knowledge and answered our questions during the seminar
22/02/24, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough knowledge and understanding!
22/02/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!
22/02/24, 5:54 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Thank you ma'am
22/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
22/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/02/24, 5:59 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Yeah I'm quite aware ma'am, thanks
22/02/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: That's great
22/02/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/02/24, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/02/24, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/02/24, 6:18 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Thank you ma'am,
I understood the process
22/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 6:22 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Thanks ma'am for the information,
I'm really getting it.
22/02/24, 6:22 pm - +263 78 126 1024: That's great
22/02/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So far what is your knowledge of the Earn While You Learn Program, Blessed?
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Ok Ms Harmehak,
What I know about the Earn While You Learn program is that the student get the opportunities from influential organizations, gain international experience, work on projects part-time and gain valuable skills while they study. The student's hardwork and consistent efforts will make them earn Scholarship credits that help them to pay for their fees.
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/02/24, 6:53 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Thank you ma'am, I now have more knowledge on it
22/02/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
22/02/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/02/24, 6:56 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Awesome ma'am,
I'm very glad to hear
22/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

Truly speaking the program is quite exquisite!
22/02/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Blessed!
22/02/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything please?
22/02/24, 7:08 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Yeah, actually I need to know when would I be expecting to start this EWYL program?
As soon as I get there or what?
22/02/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: If all goes well, The EWYL Program will start before 10th March for you!

It begins from Zimbabwe itself.
22/02/24, 7:21 pm - +263 78 126 1024: That's great, thank you
22/02/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask?
22/02/24, 7:30 pm - +263 78 126 1024: So on accommodation, will I be staying on campus or near the campus?
22/02/24, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Blessed, let me help you have better clarity about the same please.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
22/02/24, 7:34 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Thank you very much, I'm glad to hear.
The campus is safe indeed
22/02/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
22/02/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: What other queries do you have for me?
22/02/24, 7:39 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Nothing for now ma'am
22/02/24, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so Blessed since we have discussed the details!

I believe your parents are willing to support you mentally and financially?
22/02/24, 7:43 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Yeah they're more than happy to cooperate thus willing to support mentally and financially
22/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support!

So as I briefed you earlier that now the application will be submitted for the interview stage.

For the same the available slots are of 12 and 12:30 PM CAT.

Which slot shall I reserve for you and your parents?
22/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 78 126 1024: I think 12pm CAT will do.
22/02/24, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Blessed!

Do inform your parents as well.

It will be a short video call for them for 10-15 minutes, meanwhile you will have a technical round using voice notes as well.
22/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 126 1024: Ok ma'am I'll surely do so.
22/02/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: With this I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
