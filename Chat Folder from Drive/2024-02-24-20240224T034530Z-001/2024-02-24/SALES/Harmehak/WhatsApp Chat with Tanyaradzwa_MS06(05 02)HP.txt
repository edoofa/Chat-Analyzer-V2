Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 71 904 7514: Ok

05/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 904 7514: Studying abroad give an opportunity to study programmes that you can't study here in Zimbabwe also you get to  see the other side of the word and how people survive there .
05/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 904 7514: Yes l am prepared
05/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: You see, Tanyaradzwa, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
05/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Yes it's  happening maam , you know here in Zimbabwe if l apply at any university they are going to give me Agriculture that's the only programme that l am going to get yet l wanna study something which is health related as far as l know  we have a lot of farmers here in Zimbabwe and only a few have knowledge in health department thus why zimbabwe always buy drugs from other countries and people die at an early age becaause we have few professionals in our country so l desperately need the programme that l stated above and l will work hard so as to achieve my goal as well as my parent's wish
05/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Tanyaradzwa!
05/02/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Considering your aspirations Tanyaradzwa, may I know more regarding your subject combination for A level- Geography, Biology, Crop Science?
05/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 904 7514: If  l get the opportunity to do a degree MLT or if l get a diploma  l will advance it  so that l will have a degree and after the degree l wanna become an occupational therapist
05/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough understanding of your aspirations!
05/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Tanyaradzwa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 904 7514: I have their support 💯 .....and they actually helped me with support  let me call him he will be online soon

05/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tanyaradzwa!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
05/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok , as far as l know the greatest university in the word is in India also it has about 100 universities and about 1000 colleges so l belive that amoungst all those universities l will have an opportunity somewhere somehow .India also have competent lectures so l will learn  a lot of new skills and a lot of new information in if l study there
05/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Greatest university in the world is in India
05/02/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries.

05/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Yeah it's true . That's why l chose India
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 487 3570: This is wonderful.l have learnt that the most ranked people in the world are products of lndian institutions
05/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tanyaradzwa and Mrs Maria,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 904 7514: No l don't
05/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 904 7514: .no
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok thanks to Edoofa . 2000 to 3000 per year l guess it's affordable
05/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 71 904 7514: And how much per semester
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 487 3570: As parents for Tanya l think we can manage
05/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough support, however I would like to share an exciting news!
05/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: As per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and Basic University Expenses.
05/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Did l get it corrected that fees will be reduced to 2000/3000 per annum.and that Edoofa will take the remaining cost.accomodation.food.and other expenses.and that there is earn will learning program
05/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: The fee will be reduced from $6000-8000 to *$1600-$2300* if Tanyaradzwa scores a higher quantum of scholarhip.

The fee will include-
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program as well, Mrs Maria.*
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Yes but l still need more clarification.my question is 1600-2300 semester fee or annual fee
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Annual fee please!
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Wonderful. I think if Tanya gets an opportunity l will manage
05/02/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Mrs Maria, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/02/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Fine .
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

05/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok it's great
05/02/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Understood
05/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 904 7514: So how do l get the scholarship credits
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok
05/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Tanyaradzwa?
05/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Yeah
05/02/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: That's good!
05/02/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate Mrs Maria!
05/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Maria, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Thank you for appreciating
05/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Yes l do agree with with you
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Thats why we are craving for this scholarship .We  want to cut costs unlike in Zimbabwe
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you do!
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Mrs Maria,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Ok
05/02/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Maria, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/02/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Ok we are together
05/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Please?
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Would end up paying,1500
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 487 3570: ,1500/2500
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Fine
05/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Maria, *Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* 

This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 487 3570: I understand
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Nice arrangement
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Yes lam following well
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 487 3570: So 350 Will be deducted from first semester fee?
05/02/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: I am referring the registration fee please!
05/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: For students who apply by themselves for international education, enrollments and registration are two separate fees
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: However for our Proud Edoofians, registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee!
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 487 3570: I mean this amount is it to be waived off from thefee
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: No please!
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same please?
05/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 487 3570: I think l  the word (waive off)is confusing me. May you help me with its meaning particulary in this discussion
05/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: The registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from Tanyaradzwa's First Year's Fee.

For students who apply by themselves for international education, they pay enrollments and registration as two separate fees.

However for our Proud Edoofians, they donot pay two seprate fees, it just enrollment fee and the registeration is deducted from First year's fee.
05/02/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 487 3570: Its ok
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok thanks
05/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: I believe by now you have a better clarity?
05/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Yes
05/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 487 3570: We are together.In summary you are saying....,, enrollment fee
Registration fee
Tuition.food.accomodation everything will add up to,2000to3000per yr
05/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok thank you
06/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
06/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 904 7514: Morning maam
06/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Tanyaradzwa?

What all did you discuss with them?
06/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 71 904 7514: We agreed that it is very affordable and they are willing to support me both mentally and financially.
06/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 904 7514: But we wanted to know the programme fee as well as the accomodation fee
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Do you recall that costs after the scholarship include the Accomodation please?
06/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 904 7514: Yes
06/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: So what would you like to ask regarding the Program and Accommodation fee please?

Can you elaborate your query?
06/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 904 7514: You said the fees will be ranging from 2000 to 3000 per year so we wanted to know the fees for example 
Tuition fees.....600
Registration fee....... 400
Enrolment fee 600 
And it will add up to 1600 per semester  that's what I'm trying to say

06/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok l get it
06/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Ok now we are together
06/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Thats great!

What else would you like to ask?
06/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 904 7514: How much is the ticket to India
06/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August ths year as per your preparations

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

I believe so far I have been committed to assisting you the best I can as here at Edoofa we believe in providing quality education to a student. I believe you would agree that a school like Mt Selinda wouldn't be associated with Edoofa if we weren't the best opportunity for a student here in India!

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. <This message was edited>

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to engage in a discussion!
12/02/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Good Morning @263774873570 @263719047514  

How are you doing today?
12/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 904 7514: Hie
12/02/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: I have been expecting to hear from you since Thursday, Tanyaradzwa!

May I know what challenges are you facing?
12/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 904 7514: We are still making a discussion we will get back to you when we are done
12/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Which decision are you referring to please?
12/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 904 7514: They are deciding if they can manage the fees or not their budget
12/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and Basic University Expenses.

Do you recall the same, Tanyaradzwa?
12/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 904 7514: Yeah
12/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I believe you wouldn recall the EWYL Program too?

Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
