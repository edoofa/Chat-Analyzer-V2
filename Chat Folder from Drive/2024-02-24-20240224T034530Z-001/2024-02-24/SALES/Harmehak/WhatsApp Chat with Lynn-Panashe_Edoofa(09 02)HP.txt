10/02/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

12/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yess
12/02/24, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Lynn, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/02/24, 5:16 pm - +263 78 976 9157: l will be exposed to knowledge and  l wld have learned many things about other countries  and l feel like l would now be able to help my parents financially and l also see myself traveling to different places ...
  l feel like Edoofa is a step which is going to enable me to archive my goal since it is outside my country l will get an opportunity to explore more and l will acquire more technology skills
12/02/24, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Lynn, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/02/24, 6:14 pm - +263 78 976 9157: greener pastures and there are more resources as compared to Zimbabwe and l guess there are more job opportunities
12/02/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: You see, Lynn, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/02/24, 8:20 pm - +263 78 976 9157: thank you for understanding
12/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: However I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/02/24, 8:30 pm - +263 78 976 9157: l feel like India has more equipments  like computers or other technology ideas which will help me on the way to reach my destination ,also considering that video , l think l will be able to receive the education l seek for .
12/02/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
12/02/24, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*

12/02/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
12/02/24, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/02/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/02/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/02/24, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 8:44 pm - +263 78 976 9157: thank you ,India is really affordable indeed
12/02/24, 8:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/02/24, 9:02 pm - +263 78 976 9157: thanks for simplifying , l think India is quite affordable and also considering the Earn while you learn program it helps to  carry the burden of fees and l really acknowledge the program
12/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/02/24, 9:07 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okayy
12/02/24, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/02/24, 9:10 pm - +263 78 976 9157: alright
12/02/24, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
12/02/24, 9:11 pm - +263 78 976 9157: not yet maybe later
12/02/24, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
12/02/24, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/02/24, 9:13 pm - +263 78 976 9157: alright
12/02/24, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the information and shared resources, Lynn?
12/02/24, 9:14 pm - +263 78 976 9157: lm still going through it
12/02/24, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/02/24, 9:37 pm - +263 78 976 9157: LM done
12/02/24, 9:38 pm - Harmehak: So far, what is your understanding of the EWYL Program?
12/02/24, 9:40 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okay l got to know that one can be rewarded according to the hard work performed ,and also it brings costs down for the fees
12/02/24, 9:48 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
12/02/24, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: Lynn, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/02/24, 9:50 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yesss l agree ,here everything is quite expensive
12/02/24, 9:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Lynn?
12/02/24, 9:52 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yeah
12/02/24, 9:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 10:07 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue , however I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
12/02/24, 10:11 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okay bye thank you
13/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 976 9157: during weekdays l will be going to school ,attending lessons
13/02/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
13/02/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries for me?
13/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 976 9157: noooo l don't
13/02/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
13/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yesss lm ready
13/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Lynn as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
13/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 976 9157: they end up spending $2250
13/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
13/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yea its very expensive
13/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same as well?
13/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yesss everything is also slowed down here
13/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
13/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/02/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 976 9157: what is a SOP
13/02/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: StateA Statement of Purpose (SOP), also known as a research statement or a letter of intent, is written to the admission panel and talks about your career path, interests, professional contributions, goals and the driving force behind pursuing a particular program.

It is drafted by professionals!
13/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okay
13/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 976 9157: so here if l get to pay the money ,my enrollment is guaranteed and everything is  covered on the same fee
13/02/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
13/02/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/02/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 78 976 9157: alright its fine
13/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
13/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
13/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
13/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process properly and how the entire application would be proceeding for the further stages?
13/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 976 9157: thats  so considerable
13/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yesss l understood
13/02/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
13/02/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 5:18 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okay
13/02/24, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/02/24, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
13/02/24, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/02/24, 5:24 pm - +263 78 976 9157: okay
13/02/24, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
13/02/24, 5:30 pm - +263 78 976 9157: yea l saw the video and its really great
13/02/24, 5:30 pm - +263 78 976 9157: sure l will connect them
13/02/24, 5:32 pm - +1 (587) 437-4970: How are you. Great connecting to Ruth. We lnow her personally, hope we get to know more from her
13/02/24, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
13/02/24, 5:37 pm - +1 (587) 437-4970: I have been following this chat from the beginning, it's quite informative and encouraging. I have faith in it and hope Lynn will be accepted into the program. 
As her parents we are determined to put resources together and come financially where need be.
13/02/24, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough support for Lynn, please!
13/02/24, 5:41 pm - +1 (587) 437-4970: Thank you.
13/02/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
13/02/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
13/02/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

13/02/24, 6:25 pm - +1 (587) 437-4970: Thank you
14/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.
C) supplement, while sweet whey is more desirable as a food additive for humans.
D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.

7.can pollute waterways
A) NO CHANGE
B) can pollute waterway’s,
C) could have polluted waterways,
D) has polluted waterway’s,

8.scientists; and
A) NO CHANGE
B) scientists: and
C) scientists, and
D) scientists, and,

"Food insecurity is a complex and pressing issue in Africa, with multiple causes and effects. While some people claim that stagnant and inefficient farms are the main cause of food insecurity in Africa, the reality is more nuanced. Farming efficiency is certainly a factor, but it is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors such as conflict, climate change, and a lack of access to clean water and modern agricultural technology also play a role. In this essay, I will explore the various causes of food insecurity in Africa, with a particular focus on the role of farming efficient".  Conflict is a significant cause of food insecurity in Africa. Wars, civil unrest, and political instability can disrupt the supply of food, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and force people to flee their homes. In some cases, conflict can even lead to famine. For example, the civil war in South Sudan has caused widespread food insecurity, with 3.5 million people currently facing starvation.   lt's not entirely accurate to say that all Africans have poor diets due to farming inefficiency. It's true that many African countries have struggled with food insecurity, and that farming practices in some parts of the continent are not as efficient as they could be. However, there are a number of other factors that contribute to food insecurity in Africa, including conflict, climate change, and a lack of access to clean water and modern agricultural technology. Many African farmers are working hard to improve their farming practices and ensure food security for their communities. <This message was edited>

When I was a child, my parents were always there for me. They encouraged me to try new things and always supported me no matter what. Even when I made mistakes, they were there to help me learn and grow from them. I remember one time when I was in elementary school, I wanted to join the school choir. I was nervous to audition, but my parents encouraged me to try out anyway. They told me that it was okay to make mistakes, and that the important thing was to try. I ended up making the choir, and I  remember feeling so proud of myself for trying something new. My parents were so proud of me too. That experience taught me that it's okay to take risks and that my parents would always be there for me, no matter what. That's just one example of how my parents inspired me throughout my childhood. They taught me the importance of hard work, resilience, and compassion. Even now, as an adult, I still draw on their inspiration and guidance. I am so grateful for the impact they've had on my life.  Another example of how my parents inspired me. When I was in high school, I wanted to run for student body president. I knew it would be a lot of work, but my parents encouraged me to go for it. They helped me craft my campaign message and even helped me make campaign posters. On election day, I was so nervous. But I remembered what my parents had said: "It's not about winning or losing, it's about trying your best." In the end, I didn't win, but I was proud of myself for having the courage to run. And my parents were proud of me too

I have your interview slots, however, before I share the interview slots I would like the parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, could the parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
16/02/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?

16/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
16/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Mose, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Lynn's higher education in India both mentally and financially, please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!

16/02/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
16/02/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
16/02/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
16/02/24, 7:11 pm - +1 (587) 437-4970: Yes,we are very much willing and prepared
16/02/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/02/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
16/02/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
16/02/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd or 24th February 2024 for $200 and the 23rd or 24th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd or 24th  February 2024.
