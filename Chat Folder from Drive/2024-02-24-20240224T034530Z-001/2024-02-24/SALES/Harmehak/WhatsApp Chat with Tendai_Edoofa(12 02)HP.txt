15/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 822 9409: it's a very good program since it covers most of electrical sectors
15/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Correct!
15/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Alright Tendai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 71 822 9409: l see my self working at company for filling my duties as an electrical engineer, becoming a pillar of support and financial stability to my family . also inspire other young African student and  becoming an example that hard work pays off

Edoofa program can help me to achieve my dreams by
 providing foster care me in which l get health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help and asset my parents financially to pay all fees required until l finish my program that l wish to study 


3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
15/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tendai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 822 9409: Studying abroad provides a unique opportunity to gain a global perspective and broaden my understanding of different cultures. By immersing myself in a new environment, it can develop cross-cultural competencies that are increasingly important in my  interconnected world. Studying abroad can be a transformative experience that challenges me in new ways and helps me grow as a person. Studying abroad can also be a valuable asset to my future career. Employers  sometimes can value candidates who have international experience and are comfortable working across cultures. Additionally, studying abroad can provide opportunities to learn new languages, develop intercultural communication skills, and make valuable professional connections.
Zimbabwe is also a great country to  study and chase my dreams but due to unstable economy it makes it difficult to predict if my parents can be able to assist me financially till l finish my program .
15/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful and well expressed Tendai, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

15/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Tendai!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/02/24, 4:55 pm - +263 71 822 9409: according to my research it ranges form 1,500 to 6 ,000 usd per year without a scholarship
15/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
15/02/24, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 71 822 9409: Edoofa program really helps in reducing the cost of education
15/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
15/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tendai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/02/24, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, 

*Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and basic university expenses.*
15/02/24, 5:08 pm - +263 71 822 9409: thank you
15/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 71 822 9409: l understand
15/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/02/24, 5:19 pm - +263 71 822 9409: l think if one perform with high passing grade so as to get higher quantum of scholarship it make it even more affordable to study and stay in india and its impressive that through the EWLY student can even reduce the remain fees to zero thereby helping the parents
15/02/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: Thats very correct, Tendai!
15/02/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: Tendai, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
15/02/24, 5:25 pm - +263 71 822 9409: its correct , l agree cost of living is becoming more and more expensive for most middle income families
15/02/24, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Indeed and its only expected to increase with time!
15/02/24, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
15/02/24, 5:28 pm - +263 71 822 9409: thats true
15/02/24, 5:35 pm - +263 71 822 9409: yes Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible to students because if we are  to take a closer look cost of living only in Zimbabwe is about 2000 to 2500 including basic necessities with almost the remaining fee after the Edoofa scholarship  which is ranges from 1500 to 3000 per year
15/02/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tendai!
15/02/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you. <This message was edited>
15/02/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/02/24, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/02/24, 5:41 pm - +263 71 822 9409: l understand 
EWYL can be of great advantage
15/02/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: That's correct!
15/02/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/02/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/02/24, 5:53 pm - +263 71 822 9409: l understand,90-100$ is affordable
15/02/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
15/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/02/24, 6:04 pm - +263 71 822 9409: yes l realize it 
so the more effort one puts in the more he earns through EWYL program.
15/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Tendai!

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/02/24, 6:12 pm - +263 71 822 9409: yes l am
15/02/24, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: Tendai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/02/24, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 71 822 9409: about $1500-$2250
15/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/02/24, 6:19 pm - +263 71 822 9409: that's so great
15/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
15/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/02/24, 6:21 pm - +263 71 822 9409: yes this will make the application process way easier
15/02/24, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/02/24, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/02/24, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/02/24, 6:26 pm - +263 71 822 9409: l understand
15/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/02/24, 6:44 pm - +263 71 822 9409: yes l do
15/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
15/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 6:54 pm - +263 71 822 9409: okay I understand
15/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/02/24, 7:02 pm - +263 71 822 9409: okay thank you
15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
15/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

C) could have polluted waterways,
D) has polluted waterway’s,

section 5
For most Africans it's mostly hand to mouth,meaning the wages that they get after hard working is only used to my food .But the food bought is not enough to sustain them up untill they get the next wage . Due to the high rates and unstable economy in Africa ,
a person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough and nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that lack of money is the root cause of other problems.So if one does not have money ,they can not buy equipment and chemical required to bust there outputs in there farms .Luck of Input have become the main reasons for lack of food and poverty in africa since most of the families in Africa depends on there agricultural outputs.Poverty is one of the biggest socio-economic issues in  Africa and is seen as one of the countries triple threats, followed by unemployment and inequality. Despite African attempt to reduce poverty, countless people are still struggling. Non Profit Organization have tried to help with the agricultural inputs but due to corruption in Africa the  donations end up used by those with political power not the poor families.Another cause of poor diet is due to the change of climate  and global warming. Part of Africa which used to receive heavy rainfall is now receiving little rainfall which is not enough to produce  good yields. Drought is becoming common in Africa due to the raise in temperature world because of global warming . Dams ,lakes and streams are drying out causing less yields in farms .So it is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.

section 6
Inspiration, the word itself doesn 't mean anything until you are inspired by someone who you never thought would make a difference in your life. A simple gratitude that is meant nothing but a great movement. A clear awareness of what one can want in their life, but is not able to reach it. In everyone 's life there is that one person that has inspired someone.My family is very inspiring to me. I am very thankful that my parents brought me into this world. Growing up my parents always showed me how exactly things work in life. One of the hardest things that I had to accept was that I could not have everything I wanted. There were times when my parents spoiled me but I was always taught to be thankful of the things that I had and to not be so selfish. Having one sibling helped me prevent the want of being selfish. I do not know what I would do without my family. My family is very inspiring because they show me all aspects on how I should live my life through their experiences like education, parenting, and work ethic.
My family’s past experiences also teach me how to live my life the best way possible. For example, my parents did not enroll for higher education in University so they were not able to obtain lucrative careers but still they try making my life easy even they don't earn a lot . Sometimes when they fail making it up to me and my sibling there gnawing grief keep them awake at night.My parents are my heroes
16/02/24, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: Received please,

Let me get it evaluated!
16/02/24, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: Tendai, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
16/02/24, 9:04 pm - +263 77 376 7385: Yes,we are.
16/02/24, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Nyarai, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Tendai's higher education in India both mentally and financially, please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
16/02/24, 9:21 pm - +263 77 376 7385: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 9:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
16/02/24, 9:23 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
16/02/24, 9:23 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
16/02/24, 9:39 pm - +263 77 376 7385: Yes i will within the 7 days timeline and again l am willing to support my Son Tendai.
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 9:40 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd or 24th February 2024 for $200 and the 23rd or 24th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd or 24th  February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

23/02/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

Lets draw inspiration from this great quote-

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."*
23/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: So Tendai and Mrs Nyarai, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account (Mr. Needmore Maposa-Principal of Chibuwe High School) over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 376 7385: Deposit into your associate's account (Mr Needmore Maposa)
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore
