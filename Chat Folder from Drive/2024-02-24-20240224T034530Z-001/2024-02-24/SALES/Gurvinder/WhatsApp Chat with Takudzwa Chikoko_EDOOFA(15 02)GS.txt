What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Nkosilomusa provided valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship Program, emphasizing the application process and the unique Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, along with the financial aspects. 

In terms of the application process, Nkosilomusa highlighted the competitive nature of the program due to its widespread popularity. To expedite the process, he offered to assist in prioritizing the evaluation of submitted forms and securing an early career counseling session with an academic expert.

Choosing Edoofa over other agents and consultants, Nkosilomusa stressed authenticity and affordability. Unlike other options, Edoofa stood out by providing continuous support beyond admission, including assistance with accommodation, registration, and documentation. Nkosilomusa's personal experience at the airport, greeted by the mentor/Edoofa team, showcased the program's commitment to student welfare.

The core of the Edoofa Program lies in its Earn While You Learn (EWYL) initiative. Nkosilomusa explained that Edoofians participate in real-time projects from industry leaders, access internship opportunities, and attend live webinars with African CEOs. The unique aspect of this program is the ability to self-finance education beyond the initial scholarship by earning credits through project work.

Nkosilomusa shared his financial journey, highlighting a 50% tuition fee reduction based on merit, extracurriculars, statement of purpose, and recommendations from senior Edoofians. He stated that the fees will range from $1500 to $3000 per annum after the scholarship. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work on projects, earning scholarship credits each month. Some seniors managed to cover their entire $2000 cost through this initiative, serving as inspiration for others.

The involvement of parents in the process was underscored, with regular updates on the student's progress. Nkosilomusa emphasized the program's unique feature of keeping parents informed at every step. Beyond financial benefits, the EWYL program provides a platform to improve skills, expand networks, and collaborate with potential future employers.

In conclusion, Nkosilomusa's messages provide a comprehensive understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, shedding light on the application process, financial aspects, and the transformative impact of the Earn While You Learn program.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Qualifying for a scholarship involves a combination of academic merit, extracurricular achievements, personal statements, and letters of recommendation. Demonstrating passion, commitment, and alignment with the scholarship's values enhances one's eligibility, making them a strong candidate for financial assistance. I believe I'm one of those students.

15/02/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Takudzwa, Mr and Mrs Chikoko!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
15/02/24, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Nkosilomusa, can you please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
16/02/24, 8:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
16/02/24, 11:25 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/02/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
17/02/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 356 0101: Hello counsellor ,thank you , my network is often erratic , can we continue
17/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
17/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 356 0101: Sorry I never got the questions
17/02/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Takudzwa Chikoko_EDOOFA(15/02)GS IE" to "Takudzwa Chikoko_EDOOFA(15/02)GS"
17/02/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nkosilomusa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nkosilomusa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
17/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 356 0101: In short I learnt that Edoofa program has assisted a big number of students from Africa and Zimbabwe to pursue tertiary education at reputable Indian universities via funded scholarship packages , Nkosilomusa says the trip to India and the education process are all very commendable and the life is affordable for students enrolled ,as such I wish Takudzwa could get the scholarship as well
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 356 0101: Thank you , it's a rich history , bright future and  proven track record , I hope my son will be able to secure a scholarship with Edoofa
17/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chikoko, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 356 0101: Yes indeed , I think I do have the requisites in question despite my network challenges
17/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mr Chikoko, I would like to know Takudzwa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-
