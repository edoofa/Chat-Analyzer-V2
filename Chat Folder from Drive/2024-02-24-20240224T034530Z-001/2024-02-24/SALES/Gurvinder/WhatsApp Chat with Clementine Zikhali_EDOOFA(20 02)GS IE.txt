Hope you are doing well,

23/02/24, 8:46 am - +27 64 041 9655: Ok I am online
23/02/24, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Thubelihle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Thubelihle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/02/24, 9:22 am - +27 64 041 9655: No l didn't learn much from him but only that it was a good step academically
23/02/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
23/02/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 9:38 am - +27 64 041 9655: Yes it is what I am looking for
23/02/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 620 1239: I have also read this as a parent and i find it interesting so in this program students choose where they want to go for training and u help them with tuition or u get places for them
23/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Please, we offer scholarship seats in Indian Universities.
23/02/24, 9:52 am - +27 64 041 9655: So what is the next step in the application
23/02/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Clementine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 10:03 am - +27 64 041 9655: Yes I think I can meet the because I am really interested in this session as it is interesting and my parents are participating they just don't know as much about the process
23/02/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Now Clementine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23/02/24, 10:46 am - +27 64 041 9655: :-My aspiration is being able to help other people which lead me to want to pursue medicine but because I am realistic I have a back up choice which is psychology as they both have a significant contribution to people's lives 
:-My highest level of education is a High School Certificate being a Matric certificate which I did last year.
:- My parents are entrepreneurs they have a few business meaning they are self employed.
:- My mother has an O level while my father completed primary School 
:-Both my parents have been very supportive of my education they are always present in whatever is required.
:-My parents will be financially responsible for me in my studying  abroad they are very serious they have been saving.
:-l do have one sibling who is currently in high school.
:-l am Zimbabwean but I studied in a South African school.It is in Gauteng province in Johannesburg.The name of the school is Ibhongo High School. South Africa uses Matriculation instead of A Level. Therefore when I was in matric I attended a  Government school meaning there was no tuition or fees.
23/02/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Clementine.
23/02/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Medicine, or psychology, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
23/02/24, 11:58 am - +27 64 041 9655: My biggest motivation is helping others as I mentioned before. I think it gives one a sense of purpose to wake up every day knowing you could change someone's life for the better. The world can never have enough doctors. When it comes to psychology, the rest of the world is trying to tackle mental health but from what l have seen there are countries where this is not happening, especially in Africa.
23/02/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Your aspiration to study either Medicine or Psychology is driven by a strong desire to help others and make a positive impact. Whether it's through providing medical care or addressing mental health issues, your passion for improving lives is admirable.
23/02/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
23/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 620 1239: No we don't have anyone in our close family but we have distance relatives who are nurses and doctors so we wil love to have it in our family
23/02/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Matric results for evaluation?
23/02/24, 12:14 pm - +27 64 041 9655: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor in Psychology*
23/02/24, 12:19 pm - +27 64 041 9655: yes that is also good
23/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - +27 64 041 9655: yes please
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Thank you. I was aware of most of the information I have also researched some of the things. Is there more
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please this is the brief, did you understand the course?
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes
23/02/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - +27 64 041 9655: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 1:12 pm - +27 64 041 9655: I have two major long term goals professionally
:- The first will be to start a practice of my own. I have cultivated useful business skills from working holiday jobs in my parents business. Minoring in business could also help me get more skills. Therefore 5 years after the completion of my course I should be having or in the process of getting my own practice. 
:- I know that not everyone can afford mental health as other people still think it is insignificant.This brings me to my second goal.
:- I would also like to form or join a non profit organisation that provides free help to those who need it.
:- The reason I want a practice, preferably a successful one is to be able to fund volunteer trips to places that need the help therefore EDOOFA's program can help me gain the necessary tools so that l  work towards achieving my academic goals. It will help me because I will be having support from someone other than my family someone who supports my dreams enabling me to work even harder.
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Clementine I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/02/24, 1:22 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes I am ready to give it my 300%. I will use everything at my disposal to be the best me l can be.
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/02/24, 1:33 pm - +27 64 041 9655: My country has very few learning institutions and l think that learning in a country like India can help grow my career exponentially as there are many people to meet and learn from. This career also requires me to be able to communicate and going outside of my country pushes me outside of my comfort zone which also increases my experiences so l can do a better job with different people from different backgrounds in the future.
23/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/02/24, 1:43 pm - +27 64 041 9655: When I get steady in managing and growing my business I will contribute to the educational system by donating to schools to keep them running because I know the problem most of the schools in my country face is funding 
The organisation I am also very passionate about having will also help students academically by paying fees and educational programs that aid in their learning
23/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Clementine, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/02/24, 2:12 pm - +27 64 041 9655: I do agree with you but I also think there are silent hero's people who are not known but they still make a big difference. I would like to study hard in my field and get the funds I believe in actions so a reputed personality will be what I get after doing all I can to better my country academically. As for the conductive environment, I am hoping to get that in my studying abroad.
23/02/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/02/24, 2:22 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes I am wondering
I was guessing it is better academically
23/02/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
23/02/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

23/02/24, 2:55 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Ohk I see India has a lot to offer as there so many people to learn from 

The fact that all these thinkers are from an Indian educational background says a lot about it's education
23/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now Clementine, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - +27 64 041 9655: No not at the moment
23/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/02/24, 3:05 pm - +27 64 041 9655: No I only know Thubelihle and he is in your program
23/02/24, 3:06 pm - +27 64 041 9655: What is the average tuition of studying in India without a scholarship
23/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 620 1239: As a parent i don't know of any student
23/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 3:11 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes this is way lower than other countries
23/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/02/24, 3:13 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes please
23/02/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Clementine, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 3:20 pm - +27 64 041 9655: This is something I would be greatly interested in as we live in a digital age and those skills are required in every day life
23/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

23/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

23/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 3:30 pm - +27 64 041 9655: I think It will benefit me 
As I said before I have learnt a few things from my holiday job and so I have seen the importance of learning from those with experience.If this is applied on a global scale l imagine it will be priceless education from those with experience from the world empowering me to go even further
23/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Clementine, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 3:35 pm - +27 64 041 9655: So that means the scholarship also takes care of food and accommodation?
23/02/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please, the cost of education will remain in the range of $2000-3000 *which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*.
23/02/24, 3:38 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Ohhh that is very helpful
23/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/02/24, 3:44 pm - +27 64 041 9655: It is, studying abroad can be expensive and this sounds like the solution to my problems
23/02/24, 3:45 pm - +27 64 041 9655: So what happens after you are done with the degree do I have to pay it off
If yes then within how long
23/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you don't.
23/02/24, 3:50 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Oh that's great
23/02/24, 3:50 pm - +27 64 041 9655: So do you still have questions for me
23/02/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Clementine, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/02/24, 4:02 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Yes they are
23/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 620 1239: Yes we wil be supporting her throughout
23/02/24, 5:29 pm - +27 64 041 9655: Is there anything else left for today?
