Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
22/02/24, 9:09 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
23/02/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,

23/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 919 3353: Okay thank you Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Pemberayi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, is that correct?
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Yaaa sure Mr Gurvinder 😂😂😂 Blessing told me everthing and he was my classmate when we were form 4s
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, also do tell me whether you learnt about Blessing’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 919 3353: He says Edoofa can offer a 50%to 100%  programe depending on you passing level.This schorlarship will also includes the accomodation for the student and Edoofa scholarships also helps student to get vacancy oppotunities abroad after finishing your degree
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Yaaa sure tertiary eduxation here in Zimbabwe is just something else, tertiary education in Zimbabwe is going down sooo l was thinking that its better to study abroad and my parents dont have problem with that because l will also have better job oppotunities
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Pemberayi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Okay sir l understant thats why l have been asking for permission to add my mom at the first place .....sooo can l add my mom
