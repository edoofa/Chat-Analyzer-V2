Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 8:09 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 8:40 am - +263 78 235 8572: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 9:03 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 9:05 am - +263 78 235 8572: I don't really know much about it. I heard it takes you abroad and may help you get a job there as you learn and that's about it.
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 235 8572: Yes.The main reason I want a scholarship is to reduce the the financial burden on my parents.
09/02/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ayanda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 235 8572: I'm not sure but I hope I do have what it takes.
09/02/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
09/02/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Now Ayanda, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
09/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 235 8572: •I completed highschool (A level) sometime back.I wasn't a very good student but I was persistent.Not particularly driven to be the best or to do the best but I was motivated to obtain results that I felt were acceptable.

•In all honesty I don't have a specific course I would like to do.I just want a job with a salary big enough that it would enable me to take care of myslf and my family and perhaps venture into starting up an enterprise, which is something I've always wanted to do.

•On the issue of my parents occupations, my mother is a highschool teacher and my father is a qualified teacher however he is self employed in the moment due to the fact that there are better prospects for him outside teaching.

•Both my parents have been supporting me .

•Both my parents will be supporting me financially for my higher education.
I have since completed my A level.

•I studied at John Tallach High School in the Matebeleland North province. 

•I have 3 siblings .Two are currently in primary school and one is in university.

•My school fees was $700 per term <This message was edited>

12/02/24, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*
*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's start the session and embrace the transformative power of education
12/02/24, 9:27 am - +263 78 235 8572: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
12/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 368 0286: Good morning.
12/02/24, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
12/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Yes I understand what the course is about
12/02/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I'm sorry Mr Gurvinder may I respond later I'm occupied with something at the moment and hence am unable to respond
12/02/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Please address the question as soon as possible.
13/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 235 8572: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder. I'm sorry this is a day late.
13/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 235 8572: Having completed my b.com degree, I would go on to further my qualifications and pursue a post graduate course in Chartered Accounting. In the meantime, I would seek employment in the banking sector. The years spent working on my postgraduate course would be hence spent working, and this would enable me to be a financially independent member of society.

During these years, I hope I will be able to earn enough to invest in a house and other assets such as a car. It is my wish that if I successfully complete my post graduate course and become a chartered accountant during the duration of the five years, I would be able to get an even better post at work with much higher earnings. These earnings would then be saved so that they can act as start up capital for any future business ventures I may wish to pursue.

I believe that having a Bachelor of Commerce degree would give me the skills to be able to start up and run an enterprise, hence my wish to start up an enterprise.
14/02/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, as I was under the weather,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
14/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 235 8572: Good morning Mr Gurvinder. I hope you are feeling better.
14/02/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Yes, I am fine now.
14/02/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Ayanda I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
14/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 235 8572: Yes I am
14/02/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
14/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 235 8572: One of the reasons is that I'd love to live in a new environment and become exposed to different cultures, ideologies and technology.
I want to bring  new knowledge to my country and for me to do that I need to go out of my country and see the world.
Another reason is that  I want to serve as a example to my younger siblings that it's okay to go out if they ever get the opportunity because I understand that sometimes there is reluctance to leave a familiar environment.
14/02/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
14/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I'd sponsor mentor ship and lead career guidance programa and workshops around local schools. <This message was edited>
14/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ayanda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
14/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I do agree
14/02/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
14/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Yes I was .I usually hear India being recommended for people who intend on studying medicine but not other programs so that was a question on my mind .Why India?
14/02/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
14/02/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.
14/02/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let's explore how Indian graduates have impacted the world! 🌍

14/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Okay I figure that the reason why Edoofa recommends India is because the economy of India is booming and that will most probably offer better opportunities to it's people and those wig the opportunity to study there. 
I'm guessing that learning there as an outsider would give me insight on how the country has so many successful people and how I can become one of them all while having access to their  facilities <This message was edited>
14/02/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ayanda, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
14/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 235 8572: So far I have no questions but I'll be sure to bring them up if I get any <This message was edited>
14/02/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
14/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 235 8572: No.We are not familiar with it at all but I figure it must be expensive
14/02/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/02/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/02/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/02/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/02/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Ayanda what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
14/02/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Okay I understand what you're saying. I have a question about the Earn While You Learn Program, what kind of work does it involve?
14/02/24, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Ayanda, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/02/24, 4:32 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Understood Mr Gurvinder
14/02/24, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

14/02/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

14/02/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
14/02/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I think the webinars in particular would be good for me
14/02/24, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ayanda, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/02/24, 4:47 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I understand sir
14/02/24, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/02/24, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/02/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I have a question Mr Gurvinder.If Edoofa is such a great scholarship program which offerssuch great opportunities to students then how come it's not well known?
In my case I only heard about it after A level and only after I'd been told about it by a classmate
14/02/24, 10:00 pm - Gurvinder: I will connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
15/02/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
15/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 368 0286: Good mornin Mr Gurvinder.Thank you for yesterday's session, it was very informative.
15/02/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 235 8572: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
15/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: Alright Ayanda, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
15/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 235 8572: Yes they would be
15/02/24, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
15/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 235 8572: No I haven't
15/02/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
15/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 235 8572: Understood Mr Gurvinder
15/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 235 8572: I'm ready
15/02/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Ayanda as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 368 0286: It could cost $2 000- $2 500.
16/02/24, 8:00 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
16/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 368 0286: Morning Mr Gurvinder
16/02/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263773680286 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/02/24, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Good afternoon Mr Gurvinder.
16/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
16/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Where and how we pay ?
16/02/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you will be guided for that.
16/02/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 235 8572: I do think so and I'm happy that the enrollment fee would be able to cover so much
16/02/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/02/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
16/02/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 235 8572: What  does one have to have to do to get the acceptance letter?
16/02/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that will be decided after the interview with the program director.
16/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Okay
16/02/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
16/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 235 8572: No I'm not
16/02/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/02/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ayanda, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/02/24, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 235 8572: Yes I have
16/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
16/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
16/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 235 8572: No I have no questions Mr Gurvinder
16/02/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
16/02/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/02/24, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

22/02/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Please the enrollment fee will be due 7 days after Ayanda is found eligible for the program.
22/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 368 0286: Thank you.
22/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: So @263773680286 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @27688812386 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 368 0286: 1 Bachelor of Commerce( B Com)
2 India
3. 6000-8000 USD
4. 2000-3000 USD
 5 $350  in 7 days
6The earn while you learm program is designed to cushion students in fees payment.It lessens the amount payable per year.This is done through a process whereby students work on given assignments and they earn points that eventually contribute to the reduction of their fees.The program happens simultaneously with the student's studies.Points will be awarded depending on the students performance in the program.That is my understanding
7 Understood.
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: *@263773680286*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Ayanda* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Ayanda’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 368 0286: I understand
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *27th or 28th of February 2024* for $200 and the *27th or 28th of March 2024* for the remaining $150.
