08/02/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding Hopkin's interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all his likings and will help him achieve his future goals:

*​B.Tech Civil Engineering*
08/02/24, 4:03 pm - +260 97 8572640: Oho that's true we thought the same for him ,we thought he should do civil Engineering or Petroleum Engineering
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
08/02/24, 4:06 pm - +260 97 8572640: Sure
08/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
08/02/24, 4:12 pm - +260 97 8572640: So after completion of B.Tech Civil Engineering one will be given a degree ?
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - +260 97 8572640: Or maybe masters and what is the duration for a B.Tech Civil Engineering,how many years .....
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, it is a degree course.
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: The course is for 4 years.
08/02/24, 4:15 pm - +260 97 8572640: What if one intends to do a Masters ,how many years?
08/02/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the Master's course is for 2 years.
08/02/24, 4:17 pm - +260 97 8572640: Alright......
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
08/02/24, 4:20 pm - +260 97 8572640: Yes I did
08/02/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Mrs Mutengo,I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Hopkins, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is he willing to give his 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come his way inorder to transform his career?
08/02/24, 4:24 pm - +260 97 8572640: I'm very sure he is .........
08/02/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that he is willing to work hard for his career, however, can you please tell me why you want him to study abroad and not in your country?
08/02/24, 4:26 pm - +260 97 8572640: U have suggested that he goes for  civil Engineering,what do u have to say about petroleum engineering ........
08/02/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mutengo, I personally believe after counselling thousands of students that *​B.Tech Civil Engineering* gives more opportunities for students.
08/02/24, 4:33 pm - +260 97 8572640: 1.Enhanced academic experience, Academic as we know it in Zambia or should I say the quality of it can not be compared to the one being offered in countries like India.
2.Career development ,most individuals and companies will prefer to employ one with an abroad qualification than indigenous one
3.Advanced personal growth 
4.Travel experiences
08/02/24, 4:34 pm - +260 97 8572640: I think those are the main reasons as to why
08/02/24, 4:34 pm - +260 97 8572640: Alright sir
08/02/24, 8:40 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
09/02/24, 8:16 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 10:28 am - +260 97 8572640: Alright sir we can continue
09/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.
09/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 11:33 am - +260 97 8572640: Yes that is very true
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.

09/02/24, 12:03 pm - +260 97 8572640: I'm following..........
09/02/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mrs Mutengo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
09/02/24, 12:21 pm - +260 97 8572640: Yes I do understand
09/02/24, 12:22 pm - +260 97 8572640: How sure will I be , regarding my child's safety.........
09/02/24, 12:23 pm - +260 97 8572640: And what assurance will I have that my child is safe and in the right hands <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please as you got to know about Edoofa from Taonga, you can connect with the student to know about how his journey has been with us, moreover we have a special department of student welfare, which regularly visits the Universities for the Welfare of the students.
09/02/24, 12:52 pm - +260 97 8572640: That's nice to note , especially because u have a department that monitors them ........
09/02/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 8572640: I think as at now no more  questions,u can continue ..........
09/02/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
09/02/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 8572640: No
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 1:19 pm - +260 97 8572640: Mmmm okay
09/02/24, 1:20 pm - +260 97 8572640: I'm following
09/02/24, 1:22 pm - +260 97 8572640: $2000 - $3000 per annum ?....... <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
09/02/24, 1:24 pm - +260 97 8572640: Interesting, you can continue.....
09/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
09/02/24, 1:26 pm - +260 97 8572640: Sure
09/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mutengo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/02/24, 1:29 pm - +260 97 8572640: I'm following...........
09/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

09/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

09/02/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/02/24, 1:34 pm - +260 97 8572640: I do surely think this will be of good benefit..........
09/02/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs Mutengo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/02/24, 1:37 pm - +260 97 8572640: For sure......
09/02/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/02/24, 1:40 pm - +260 97 8572640: Wow that's really impressive
09/02/24, 1:41 pm - +260 97 8572640: It's really good
09/02/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mutengo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Hopkins for his higher education.
09/02/24, 1:45 pm - +260 97 8572640: Indeed
09/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
09/02/24, 1:50 pm - +260 97 8572640: Yes I have ........
09/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/02/24, 1:56 pm - +260 97 8572640: Alright
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Mutengo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 97 8572640: I'm following
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 97 8572640: Approximately $2300
09/02/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Mutengo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/02/24, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:07 pm - +260 97 8572640: Okay
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/02/24, 2:12 pm - +260 97 8572640: Okay
09/02/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/02/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/02/24, 2:18 pm - +260 97 8572640: Okay
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/02/24, 2:21 pm - +260 97 8572640: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Mutengo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
09/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/02/24, 2:29 pm - +260 97 8572640: Yes
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
09/02/24, 2:37 pm - +260 97 8572640: What happens after one fails pay the cost required at step 6 ,is their money paid before refunded or ....
09/02/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that is the registration that one has to pay the University, which is a part of the tuition fees, you will be given time for that and is not an extra cost.
09/02/24, 2:41 pm - +260 97 8572640: Mmmmm alright.........
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 8572640: So if someone can not afford the application form ,given the Economic crisis in Africa specifically Zambia , what's next
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

It has been 30 years since the brutal massacre that truncated in Rwanda with this said I'd like to note that  Rwanda has rebuilt itself after the aftermath of the tragedy setting itself apart from other developing nations investment and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture and basic infrastructure. Rwanda was a devastated country it's basic structure was destroyed , millions of people were displaced and many surviving Tutsis had lost their families . Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence . Today Rwanda has rebuilt from the ashes of horrific tragedy . Rwanda's drive to rebuild it's economy after the genocide has been driven by three main sources which is the export of tea and coffee , foreign aid which constituted gross annual income and the tourism trade. After the genocide about thousands of refugees remained in exile. The economy of Rwanda has undergone rapid industrialization due to a successful governmental policy, it has a mixed economy. Countless survivors developed long term psychological problems. However, over time Rwanda rebuilt itself and survivors played an important role in it's development. Economically, it eeoded the country's ability to  attract private and external investment. However it has now made significant progress in stabilitising and rehabilitating it's economy. Over the years Rwanda noted the significant improvement in terms of access to utilities . Access to health care was also improving although there were disparities between urban and rural communities. The country has come farther than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted .All this development is important to recognize because It has been the governments policy to express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to it's people in order to mitigate the genocide ideology .There were several  grenade attacks  in Kigali. There were ongoing complaints about democratic principles . Travelling was bound to be a bumpy ride . In the months leading to elections they had, independent and opposition  media outlets were banned and opposition candidates were harassed . Some where arrested and banned from taking part in election processes while others fled from the country . Presidents were only allowed to rule two seven year terms. Survivors reported that they had experienced on average twelve different types of traumatic event types in comparison to different types of  traumatic successors. Most reports were mainly linked to witnessing violence throughout the period of the genocide whereas other former prisoners emphasized being physically attacked referring to their time spent in refugee camps  or to imprisonment. A regression analysis of data of the parent generation revealed that the exposure to traumatic successors,the level of physical illness and the level of social intergration  were predictors of PTSD whereas economic status, age and gender were not. There were demonstrations of  particular long term  consequences of massive organized violence such as war and genocide , on mental health and psychological conditions. Differences between families of survivers and of prisoners were accused of participating in the genocide .

       It has always been part of our life journey to encounter different challenges in life ,in every achievement, frustration and happiness our lives .My parents are always there by my side to guide and push me up, I am so frenzied and grateful for I have them  as my inspiration.
      To start ,my parents are a great gift in life ,I cannot imagine life without them ,Dr TP chia said " parents love is the only love that is truly selfless , unconditional and forgiving."

         Further, my parents are my guide and give me courage to face obstacles in this life . My mother always smiles no matter what the circumstances are and that gives me the strength and inspiration to face all problems.
My Father goes to the office but still does not forget to help me with my studies. They always encourage me in every aspect and motivate me even when I don't succeed.
         On top that , according to me if we have got the parents love then we've got the world's most expensive thing ,may God give me strength and power to take my parents name higher and higher 
         In conclusion,my parents have made me understand what life is about and how to find that little ray of happiness in different situations. What I am today and what I will become in the future is only because of the support and affection of my parents,they have made me disciplined, dedicated and sincere because of this I am so inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life .
