*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 524 0230: Thank you Mr Gurvinder.  I am Munashe Hope Muvirimi. Thank for the much needed assistance.
23/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Munashe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 524 0230: Noted. Thank you
23/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 524 0230: I know Edoofa Scholarship as a program that assist in sponsoring, mentoring individuals wishing to persue their careers and achieving future aspirations
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Great. I am impressed. Thank you
23/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Yes. I am also looking forward to take responsibility towards my higher education and help my guardian mother reduce financial burden towards my education as she strive to make ends meet
23/02/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Munashe, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 524 0230: Yes
23/02/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now Munashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 524 0230: 1.My highest education level is a Bachelor of Science degree in Optometry
2. I would like to study a Masters degree in Optometry so that I will be able to open my practice in the future and help my sibling to further her studies too
3. Both my parents are deceased when I was in grade 2. I am surviving by my guardian mother who is a primary school teacher.
4. Bachelor of Education in ICT
5. My guardian Mother Tinei Makuni has been supporting my education
6. I am looking forward that guardian mother will support my education abroad although I know that it will be very difficult for her
7. I have one sister  , a biological daughter to my guardian mother who is studying towards a Social Work degree at Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University. Which marks the reason why I need financial assistance from Edoofa as my guardian parent cannot afford to pay her fees and mine at the same time
8. I did my A level at Chindunduma High in Mashonaland. Staying with my uncle and School fees was $80 per term
23/02/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Munashe.
