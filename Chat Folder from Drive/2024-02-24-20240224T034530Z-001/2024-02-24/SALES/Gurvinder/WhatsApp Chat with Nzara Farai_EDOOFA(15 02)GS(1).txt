I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

22/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 578 3495: The above information was got from Farai who talked to Nyasha 👆
22/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
22/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 578 3495: Our place has network problems for easy communication
22/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: So are you available for the session today?
22/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Yes , sir
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 578 3495: You can do that for my son ,Farai Nzara so that you lessen my financial burden
22/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Nzara, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
22/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Yes I can be there when counseling takes place . Where does that take place ?
22/02/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please the counselling session takes place in this group only.
22/02/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Ok thanks very much . You may proceed
22/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Nzara, I would like to know Farai better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course he would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?

7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was his per-term fee in A level?
22/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Farai Nzara completed A Level last year at Jameson  High School in Kadoma town in Mashonaland West province He got 15 points in Mats Physics and Chemistry .I was paying his fees which was $150 with the help of his two sisters .

22/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know Farai, Mr Nzara.
22/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during Farai's introduction you mentioned he would like to study Civil Engineering, could you please share what motivates him behind this field of study?
22/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 578 3495: It is his area of interest coupled with the combination of subjects perused at school .He will be marketable if he takes this field
22/02/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

22/02/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding his interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all his likings and will help him achieve his future goals:

*B.Tech Civil Engineering*
22/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Thank very much for your evaluation
22/02/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about the course?
22/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 578 3495: With pleasure sir
22/02/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
22/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Thank you very much for enlightening me . I hope that's his passion and you have chosen the right program for him
22/02/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Yes sir . I'm happy it covers a broad spectrum
22/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now, can you please tell me why you want him to study abroad and not in your country?
22/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 578 3495: There are facilities better than ours here
22/02/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for him to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning for him to study abroad?
22/02/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Yes sir
22/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 578 3495: It's ok . He may go and study there .  I appreciate that
22/02/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
22/02/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

22/02/24, 9:04 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
22/02/24, 9:27 pm - +263 77 578 3495: It's ok we will talk provided there are no network problems
23/02/24, 8:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
23/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 578 3495: Good morning . We're now on line
23/02/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: So now Nzara, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 578 3495: No.
23/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 578 3495: We are not familiar
23/02/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/02/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 578 3495: Ok
23/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 578 3495: You may go ahead sir with pleasure
23/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Nzara, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Quite a nice program
23/02/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/02/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis

23/02/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 578 3495: I really think it will benefit my son especially i in this fast changing world
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mr Nzara, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 578 3495: So basically it .means the harder you work ,the more you earn and the less the fees the student pays ,or no fees payment at all
23/02/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
23/02/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 578 3495: That's exactly what I was looking for
23/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Nzara, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Farai for the higher education.
23/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 578 3495: That is if it is a some I can afford . Financial constraints made me turn to your organization for assistance
23/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Some for sum ..correction
23/02/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Yes sir
23/02/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Nzara as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/02/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 578 3495: $1500 to 2250
23/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mr Nzara, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/02/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Okay .When is that amount paid
23/02/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: I will explain, but first, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Okay .That's right
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/02/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 578 3495: I have understood
23/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 578 3495: When is the acceptance letter expected to be out
23/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be after the student is found eligible for the program.
23/02/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/02/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 578 3495: I'm not familiar with it
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mr Nzara, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/02/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 578 3495: I have understood
23/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/02/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 578 3495: So the fees will be known after admission .Who will cater for the transport from Zimbabwe to India
23/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Further more ,who will pay for the visa application and it's how much
23/02/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the cost of education will stay in the range of $2000-3000, which can be reduced by the EWYL program.
23/02/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of travelling to India is a one-time cost, but I assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the whole process.
23/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Ok You may go ahead
23/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 578 3495: What does one time cost mean .What is the range of the cost of visa
23/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Please that varies time to time.
23/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 578 3495: Ok
23/02/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/02/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
