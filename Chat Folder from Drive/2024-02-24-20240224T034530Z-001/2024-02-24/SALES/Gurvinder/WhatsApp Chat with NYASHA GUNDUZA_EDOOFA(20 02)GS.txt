22/02/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Nyasha, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Komborero, is that correct?
22/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 71 480 2361: No
22/02/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Komborero, also do tell me whether you learnt about Komborero’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
22/02/24, 9:14 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
23/02/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
23/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 71 480 2361: Hie ......I didn't get to meet Komborero
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 71 480 2361: Okay thank you for the insight into the scholarship program
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyasha, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 480 2361: Okay I will try to meet the metrics as best as I can
23/02/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Now Nyasha, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23/02/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 480 2361: Well there is really not a lot to tell you what I would like to do is to work  with patients in health field doing a course in either in pharmacy, physical therapy or optometry.
- My highest level of education is A level that I completed last year at Mufakose 1 high.
- In terms of the course I can't say I have a clear option I am undecided between optometry and physical therapy.
- My father is deceased and mother is unemployed.
- My parents did do their O level studies.
- My mother has been supporting me so far with help from my sister.
- Hopefully Edoofa.
- I have a brother in University and a sister who is unemployed.
- I finished my A level studies last year at Mufakose 1 high, based in Harare . My fees was around $60-$80 depending on the inflation.
23/02/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Nyasha.
23/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share what were your plans for higher education before knowing about Edoofa?
23/02/24, 6:00 pm - +263 71 480 2361: So before this I was interested in studying physiotherapy at the  University of Zimbabwe
