406 - 23 Feb 2024 11:20AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -  Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due.  If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.  If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
407 - 23 Feb 2024 11:21AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well -  Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.  If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.  I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?

Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
164 - 23 Feb 2024 09:45AM - +263 77 362 6739: I am ready
165 - 23 Feb 2024 09:48AM - Garima Edoofa: Mr. James as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>",No,No

8 - 23 Feb 2024 09:07AM - Garima Edoofa: I am doing good, please.

10 - 23 Feb 2024 09:09AM - +263 78 019 8320: Oky thank you so much and it's nice to meet,. I am KUDAKWASHE TERRANCE TUKUTA , a boy aged 24 years

13 - 23 Feb 2024 09:31AM - +263 78 019 8320: It's ok
14 - 23 Feb 2024 09:41AM - Garima Edoofa: @263780198320 May I know why did your mother left the group?
15 - 23 Feb 2024 09:52AM - +263 78 019 8320: My mother is asking me that are you offering a fully funded scholarship, can you explain further to me so that l can talk to her
17 - 23 Feb 2024 10:09AM - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on what you exactly mean by fully funded scholarship?
18 - 23 Feb 2024 10:13AM - +263 78 019 8320: A scholarship whereby you will responsible for all the costs
19 - 23 Feb 2024 10:15AM - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  1. Scholarships 2. Sponsorships  Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
20 - 23 Feb 2024 10:16AM - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
21 - 23 Feb 2024 10:29AM - +263 78 019 8320: Oky l understand
22 - 23 Feb 2024 10:45AM - Garima Edoofa: So, @263780198320 can you please tell me whether Edoofa is a scholarship program or a Sponsorship?
23 - 23 Feb 2024 11:06AM - +263 78 019 8320: From my own understanding, it's a scholarship program
24 - 23 Feb 2024 11:07AM - Garima Edoofa: Yes, correct.
25 - 23 Feb 2024 11:08AM - Garima Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Providence!  So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what did you happen to learn from your friend?

115 - 23 Feb 2024 09:49AM - +263 78 015 6451: Studying in India offers a diverse academic environment, exposure to rich cultural experiences, and cost-effective education. These factors can enhance my adaptability, cross-cultural communication, and global perspectives, positively impacting my career. To achieve my career aspirations, I plan to leverage India's robust educational system, engage in industry-relevant internships, and build a professional network. This approach will equip me with practical skills and connections essential for success in my chosen field, fostering a well-rounded and globally competitive skill set.
116 - 23 Feb 2024 10:15AM - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tendai. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.  Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
117 - 23 Feb 2024 10:19AM - +263 78 015 6451: Yes there are aware
118 - 23 Feb 2024 10:22AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the same in detail, please.
119 - 23 Feb 2024 10:22AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.  Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

17 - 23 Feb 2024 09:22AM - +27 64 041 9655: No l didn't learn much from him but only that it was a good step academically
18 - 23 Feb 2024 09:36AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19 - 23 Feb 2024 09:36AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20 - 23 Feb 2024 09:36AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
26 - 23 Feb 2024 09:52AM - +27 64 041 9655: So what is the next step in the application
27 - 23 Feb 2024 09:58AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Clementine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28 - 23 Feb 2024 10:03AM - +27 64 041 9655: Yes I think I can meet the because I am really interested in this session as it is interesting and my parents are participating they just don't know as much about the process
29 - 23 Feb 2024 10:09AM - Gurvinder: Now Clementine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
30 - 23 Feb 2024 10:46AM - +27 64 041 9655: :-My aspiration is being able to help other people which lead me to want to pursue medicine but because I am realistic I have a back up choice which is psychology as they both have a significant contribution to people's lives :-My highest level of education is a High School Certificate being a Matric certificate which I did last year. :- My parents are entrepreneurs they have a few business meaning they are self employed. :- My mother has an O level while my father completed primary School :-Both my parents have been very supportive of my education they are always present in whatever is required. :-My parents will be financially responsible for me in my studying  abroad they are very serious they have been saving. :-l do have one sibling who is currently in high school. :-l am Zimbabwean but I studied in a South African school.It is in Gauteng province in Johannesburg.The name of the school is Ibhongo High School. South Africa uses Matriculation instead of A Level. Therefore when I was in matric I attended a  Government school meaning there was no tuition or fees.

32 - 23 Feb 2024 11:45AM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Medicine, or psychology, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
33 - 23 Feb 2024 11:58AM - +27 64 041 9655: My biggest motivation is helping others as I mentioned before. I think it gives one a sense of purpose to wake up every day knowing you could change someone's life for the better. The world can never have enough doctors. When it comes to psychology, the rest of the world is trying to tackle mental health but from what l have seen there are countries where this is not happening, especially in Africa.
34 - 23 Feb 2024 12:03PM - Gurvinder: Your aspiration to study either Medicine or Psychology is driven by a strong desire to help others and make a positive impact. Whether it's through providing medical care or addressing mental health issues, your passion for improving lives is admirable.

87 - 23 Feb 2024 10:24AM - Gurvinder: So now Nzara, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
88 - 23 Feb 2024 10:28AM - +263 77 578 3495: No.
89 - 23 Feb 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
90 - 23 Feb 2024 10:35AM - +263 77 578 3495: We are not familiar
91 - 23 Feb 2024 11:36AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
92 - 23 Feb 2024 11:36AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
93 - 23 Feb 2024 11:36AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
94 - 23 Feb 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
95 - 23 Feb 2024 11:37AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

97 - 23 Feb 2024 11:56AM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
98 - 23 Feb 2024 11:58AM - +263 77 578 3495: You may go ahead sir with pleasure
99 - 23 Feb 2024 12:04PM - Gurvinder: Nzara, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
100 - 23 Feb 2024 12:21PM - +263 77 578 3495: Quite a nice program
101 - 23 Feb 2024 12:23PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

133 - 23 Feb 2024 02:41PM - +263 77 603 1331: It's a good idea you can do so .l am eagerly waiting
134 - 23 Feb 2024 02:42PM - Harmehak: Sure please!
135 - 23 Feb 2024 02:42PM - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
136 - 23 Feb 2024 02:44PM - +263 77 603 1331: Thank you for shading more light

176 - 23 Feb 2024 06:48PM - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
177 - 23 Feb 2024 06:53PM - +263 77 603 1331: Okey l understand now but the challenge l am facing now l have to exam fee for my son who is writing his examinations this year so this month l cannot afford

45 - 23 Feb 2024 05:47PM - +263 71 356 2036: My love for computers started in primary school when I got my first laptop, since then I wanted everything to do with computers. In Ordinary Level I managed to do Computer Science as a practical subject and it increased my love for the subject. I passed my Ordinary level, and I managed to do the Subject in my Adavanced level. That was when realized that the way to satisfy my love for computers was to study Information Technology
46 - 23 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful, Wellington!
47 - 23 Feb 2024 05:51PM - Harmehak: So what all did you happen to research about your desired course?
48 - 23 Feb 2024 05:55PM - +263 71 356 2036: Not that much, but about what it ventures into, which networks and software management to name a few. And also it has a great pay slip.
49 - 23 Feb 2024 06:18PM - Harmehak: Alright please!  What are your thoughts on Physics being a mandatory requirement for Engineering, Wellington?
50 - 23 Feb 2024 06:22PM - +263 71 356 2036: Yes I am aware
51 - 23 Feb 2024 06:22PM - +263 71 356 2036: I thought it is under Computer Applicants , not engineering
52 - 23 Feb 2024 06:23PM - Harmehak: Alright, so why didn't you happen to pursue physics?
53 - 23 Feb 2024 06:24PM - Harmehak: While Physics is a mandatory requirement for Engineering!  You are eligible to pursue Bachelor in Computer Applications and Bachelor of science in Computer science, please! <This message was edited>

65 - 23 Feb 2024 06:38PM - Harmehak: Great!  So would you like to pursue the same?
66 - 23 Feb 2024 06:39PM - +263 71 356 2036: Yes ma'am
67 - 23 Feb 2024 06:43PM - Harmehak: Alright Wellington, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
68 - 23 Feb 2024 06:59PM - +263 71 356 2036: When I finished reading the paragraph I understood that the course I first preferred and computer applications are basically in the same path, and it would still satisfy my love for computers. This will help me achieve my goal which is starting a computer-based firm, becoming the first in my family providing great motivation for my siblings. Due to the income of my family, things were not easy as I grew up and I would not want the same in the future for my family and me, and this scholarship opportunity would make a pivotal role.
69 - 23 Feb 2024 07:22PM - Harmehak: I am glad you understood the same!
70 - 23 Feb 2024 07:22PM - Harmehak: That is really great Wellington, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!  Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
71 - 23 Feb 2024 07:40PM - +263 71 356 2036: Thank you
72 - 23 Feb 2024 07:45PM - +263 71 356 2036: Clearly, Zimbabwe is not in a great economic situation as compared to India. I believe studying in India, a technologically developed country would equip me with enough ability and expertise to help with positively developing my country
73 - 23 Feb 2024 07:50PM - Harmehak: You see, Wellington, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.",No,No

1 hr 27 mins","147 - 23 Feb 2024 11:03AM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

150 - 23 Feb 2024 11:24AM - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
151 - 23 Feb 2024 11:56AM - +27 65 380 9517: Yes please
152 - 23 Feb 2024 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
153 - 23 Feb 2024 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
154 - 23 Feb 2024 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu -It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje -Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
155 - 23 Feb 2024 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
156 - 23 Feb 2024 12:58PM - +27 65 380 9517: Yes l do because l will be able to help my parents in some basic needs

155 - 23 Feb 2024 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
156 - 23 Feb 2024 12:58PM - +27 65 380 9517: Yes l do because l will be able to help my parents in some basic needs

159 - 23 Feb 2024 02:26PM - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
