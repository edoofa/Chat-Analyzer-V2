There is no deadline for the project. There is no order in which you have to do the project. There is no limit on how much you have to do a project. There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects. It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.* Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

I am writing to express my concern about your child's recent absence from sessions and lack of response in our EWYL group. It has been a whole week now since we last heard from Tadiwanashe, and as a mentor, I am worried about their unavailability, especially considering that we have only a few months left before the culmination of our program.  While many of my students have already begun preparing for their air tickets and actively engaging in our program, the absence is noticeable. If you are facing any challenges or difficulties that are preventing you from participating, please know that you can always share them with me.  Kindly connect with me, and share your thoughts with me. I am here to support you.🤝🏼

I am writing to express my concern about your child's recent absence from sessions and lack of response in our EWYL group. It has been a whole week now since we last heard from Tadiwanashe, and as a mentor, I am worried about their unavailability, especially considering that we have only a few months left before the culmination of our program.  While many of my students have already begun preparing for their air tickets and actively engaging in our program, the absence is noticeable. If you are facing any challenges or difficulties that are preventing you from participating, please know that you can always share them with me.  Kindly connect with me, and share your thoughts with me. I am here to support you.🤝🏼

In a statement yesterday, ZIMCHE said Shard University of India, Genre American University, Parul University, Near East University, the University of Kyrenia and the European University of Lefke and the University of Nicosia all of Cyprus, were not recognised in Zimbabwe as degree offering institutions.  In an earlier statement last week, ZIMCHE said it did not recognise all degrees offered in Zimbabwe by IIP, which it said had not complied with local regulations.  ZIMCHE said all those awarded honorary doctorate degrees could, therefore, not use the titles.  IIP however, insisted that they were not offering degrees, but awards.  “The International Institute of Philanthropy is not authorised to award degrees in Zimbabwe as it is not a registered higher education institution. Therefore, the awarding of degrees by the International Institute of Philanthropy is not only a violation of the laws of Zimbabwe, but also undermines the integrity of the entire higher education system in Zimbabwe.  “We take the integrity of the higher education system in Zimbabwe very seriously and will not tolerate any attempts to undermine it,” said ZIMCHE adding that IIP was operating outside the dictates of Section 75 (3) of the Constitution as read with Section 10 (1) of the Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education Act which prohibits institutions not registered and accredited by the ZIMCHE from offering degrees in Zimbabwe.  IIP issued its own statement yesterday in response to ZIMCHE, saying they were not an institution of higher learning as alleged, but that it was only awarding honorary doctorates and not qualifications.  “The honorary doctor of Humane Letters is classified as an award and not a qualification. It is accompanied by the prefixes h and c, and is classified as an honoris causa degree meant to show respect and appreciation which means it’s an award and not a qualification.  “All recipients of the said honorary award do not sit for examinations of any kind, do not pay tuition fees, and do not have a syllabus that they study so as to qualify for the said award. We do not hold graduation ceremonies and simply present credentials, honours, and awards to recipients.  “The institute https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va80yJG17EmlyoM1h93k believed that the practice of philanthropy can never be attained academically at any juncture and as such this positive approach is wholly justified as philanthropists and humanitarian practitioners or individuals who practice philanthropy are born and live a life of practising philanthropy.  “The International Institute of Philanthropy is an institute of excellence, integrity and philanthropy solely dedicated to the advancement of humanity through philanthropy, increasing awareness and understanding of philanthropy, improving its practice, and enhancing participation through public service, education, research, fundraising, and management of non-profits while simultaneously acknowledging, celebrating philanthropists.” The Herald

Looking forward to our session tomorrow. Have a fantastic day!

Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $1800 for the first year.  Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrives in India will be $1800- $1000 = $800. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $400 and $400 , with a six-month gap between them.

The remaining amount of $800 for the first year tuition fees can be paid in installments.  The first installment can be paid either before you arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.  I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?

The remaining amount of $800 for the first year tuition fees can be paid in installments.  The first installment can be paid either before you arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.  I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?

296 - 12 Mar 2024 02:56PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 24th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
297 - 12 Mar 2024 03:05PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
298 - 12 Mar 2024 03:31PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
293 - 12 Mar 2024 02:16PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am

300 - 12 Mar 2024 03:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, According to the payment plan, you can pay the amount of $1000 for your registration fees in installment, This $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 24th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of $500 before the second deadline date of *April 24th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
301 - 12 Mar 2024 03:51PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 24th, 2024*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
302 - 12 Mar 2024 03:53PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
306 - 12 Mar 2024 04:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
307 - 12 Mar 2024 04:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:  Account Name: Rajan Nayer Name of Bank: FBC Branch: Harare Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004 Swift Code: FBCPZWHA Sort Code: 8127
308 - 12 Mar 2024 04:02PM - +263 71 614 6798: There isn’t anyone who can make payment in harare
309 - 12 Mar 2024 04:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.  If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
310 - 12 Mar 2024 04:34PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
311 - 12 Mar 2024 05:49PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -  Account Holder - Charles Jerera Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828 Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited Branch - Masvingo

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

91 - 12 Mar 2024 02:13PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
92 - 12 Mar 2024 02:13PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
93 - 12 Mar 2024 02:13PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
94 - 12 Mar 2024 02:13PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
95 - 12 Mar 2024 02:21PM - +263 71 727 3728: I am following closely
96 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
97 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
98 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
99 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
100 - 12 Mar 2024 02:41PM - +263 71 727 3728: Yes its all clear . I totally understand .
101 - 12 Mar 2024 02:53PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
102 - 12 Mar 2024 02:55PM - +263 71 727 3728: Yes Sure
103 - 12 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.  They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
104 - 12 Mar 2024 03:08PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?  For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.  If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
105 - 12 Mar 2024 03:42PM - +263 71 727 3728: ..Yes Sure

406 - 12 Mar 2024 02:19PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Could we please be time conscious today since punctuality is a priority in EDOOFA
407 - 12 Mar 2024 02:39PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, You are absolutely right Punctuality is the First Priority, please. I would like to assist you here with your doubts. Let me first assist with your first doubts regarding the scholarship, The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.  This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
408 - 12 Mar 2024 02:47PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Meaning this amount is converting everything??am sorry but i still don't understand  As in where is this $2000-3000 coming from please <This message was edited>
409 - 12 Mar 2024 02:57PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, Let me help you understand. The cost of education we have shared with you was from $2000 - $3000 right ?
410 - 12 Mar 2024 02:58PM - +265 888 03 87 59: Alright go ahead
411 - 12 Mar 2024 03:08PM - +265 888 87 29 48: Are you referring the range of $2000 _$3000 from the admission/Offer letter given?  I would like you explanation to be too detailed considering that we from this side do t know and need to understand which ones are paid from us as a breakdown sort of, and which ones from your side.  Secondly in one of your messages you indicated that we will have multiple admissions for us to choose one of our preferences and here we are just discussing of the only one sent without any explanation.  Thanks for your availability to make us understand the whole process.. Bear with us
435 - 12 Mar 2024 04:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
436 - 12 Mar 2024 04:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 24th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?

477 - 12 Mar 2024 02:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the concern you shared with me yesterday, I would like to guide you here. While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.  To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
478 - 12 Mar 2024 02:19PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's worth noting that we have been working in the education sector for over 14 years, ensuring that all the universities we are associated with maintain a high standard of education for our students. The message you shared seems to question the quality of education and directly counters the recommendation made by the academic board. With that in mind, I would like to understand your perspective more comprehensively to address this matter effectively. Could you please share your thoughts here?
479 - 12 Mar 2024 02:27PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay. I was thinking that it is good if we apply for another university. When I started the application process I was told that one can apply to different universities. Maybe I have got only one choice.
480 - 12 Mar 2024 02:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.  I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
481 - 12 Mar 2024 02:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
482 - 12 Mar 2024 02:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.  I hope you are clear about this now?
483 - 12 Mar 2024 02:52PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I think we have to wait for other universities, as for this one I have just shared my honest insight.
484 - 12 Mar 2024 03:06PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?",No,No

The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

70 - 12 Mar 2024 12:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
71 - 12 Mar 2024 12:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
72 - 12 Mar 2024 12:44PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?

194 - 12 Mar 2024 11:26AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
195 - 12 Mar 2024 11:27AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
196 - 12 Mar 2024 11:43AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes ma'am I have
197 - 12 Mar 2024 11:47AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am is the $650 the one we can clear with the EWYL program ?
198 - 12 Mar 2024 12:45PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, you can pay the amount of $650 with the help of the credits you will earn in your EWYL program. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
199 - 12 Mar 2024 12:45PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
200 - 12 Mar 2024 12:45PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

358 - 12 Mar 2024 02:43PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
359 - 12 Mar 2024 02:43PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
360 - 12 Mar 2024 02:47PM - +260 760061219: I’m actually Zambian.
361 - 12 Mar 2024 03:01PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.

Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

403 - 12 Mar 2024 02:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.  Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
404 - 12 Mar 2024 02:29PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes it is fantastic
405 - 12 Mar 2024 02:46PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:  1. Tuition Fee: $350 2. Accommodation Fee: $0 3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575 4. International Student Development Fund: $300 5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125 6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250 7. Medical Insurance fee: $40 <This message was edited>
406 - 12 Mar 2024 02:47PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes i have noted
407 - 12 Mar 2024 02:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1640  At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are three components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee, the Misc. Fee and Medical Insurance. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1640 (tuition) + $250 (fees) +$50(uniform)= $1940  It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1640. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

403 - 12 Mar 2024 02:25PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.  Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
404 - 12 Mar 2024 02:29PM - +265 880 26 63 24: Yes it is fantastic

407 - 12 Mar 2024 02:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1640  At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are three components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee, the Misc. Fee and Medical Insurance. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1640 (tuition) + $250 (fees) +$50(uniform)= $1940  It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1640. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

410 - 12 Mar 2024 03:06PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the ""Earn While You Learn"" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
411 - 12 Mar 2024 03:12PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I have gone through the message
412 - 12 Mar 2024 03:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1640, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.  Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
413 - 12 Mar 2024 03:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.  The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
425 - 12 Mar 2024 03:58PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 16th, 2024*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
426 - 12 Mar 2024 03:59PM - +265 880 26 63 24: The option is very clear
427 - 12 Mar 2024 04:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
428 - 12 Mar 2024 04:00PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
429 - 12 Mar 2024 04:01PM - +265 880 26 63 24: I stay in Malawi and not in Zimbabwe
430 - 12 Mar 2024 04:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
431 - 12 Mar 2024 04:18PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment.

459 - 12 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, Regarding the concern you shared with me yesterday, I would like to guide you here. While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.  To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
460 - 12 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's worth noting that we have been working in the education sector for over 14 years, ensuring that all the universities we are associated with maintain a high standard of education for our students. The message you shared seems to question the quality of education and directly counters the recommendation made by the academic board. With that in mind, I would like to understand your perspective more comprehensively to address this matter effectively. Could you please share your thoughts here?
461 - 12 Mar 2024 02:41PM - +27 69 308 9669: Nothing too much ma'am but we just need explanation as you explained

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete Lovely Professional University admission formalities.
388 - 12 Mar 2024 01:44PM - +263 78 013 3757: Good afternoon
389 - 12 Mar 2024 01:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tashinga,  In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.  Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
390 - 12 Mar 2024 01:48PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly.  It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
393 - 12 Mar 2024 01:53PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
394 - 12 Mar 2024 01:56PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we can proceed
395 - 12 Mar 2024 01:58PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
396 - 12 Mar 2024 01:58PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -  1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter? 2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course? 3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)? 4. What’s the Registration fee?
397 - 12 Mar 2024 02:04PM - +263 78 013 3757: 1) my seemester tuition fee is 975  2) The standard duration for the course is 3 years  3) admission processing fee is 200  4) registration fee is 700
398 - 12 Mar 2024 02:21PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*  After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
399 - 12 Mar 2024 02:24PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes it is
400 - 12 Mar 2024 02:41PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
401 - 12 Mar 2024 02:41PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*  The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different.  So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.  The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
402 - 12 Mar 2024 02:41PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*  We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.  The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.

404 - 12 Mar 2024 02:54PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.  However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.

405 - 12 Mar 2024 02:54PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.  *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
406 - 12 Mar 2024 03:01PM - +263 78 013 3757: Well clear
407 - 12 Mar 2024 03:26PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.  If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
408 - 12 Mar 2024 03:33PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes well clear
409 - 12 Mar 2024 03:43PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  March 25th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
410 - 12 Mar 2024 03:48PM - +263 78 013 3757: Is it not 30 days
411 - 12 Mar 2024 03:49PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?

413 - 12 Mar 2024 03:52PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes you can explain
414 - 12 Mar 2024 04:13PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, According to the payment plan, you can pay the amount of $700 for your registration fees in installment, This $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of $375 before the first deadline date of *March 25th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of $375 before the second deadline date of *April 25th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
415 - 12 Mar 2024 04:14PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $700 within 15 working days, before March 25th, 2024*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
416 - 12 Mar 2024 04:16PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes it's clear now
417 - 12 Mar 2024 04:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
418 - 12 Mar 2024 04:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?

276 - 12 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
277 - 12 Mar 2024 11:34AM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
278 - 12 Mar 2024 11:35AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
279 - 12 Mar 2024 11:53AM - +263 77 443 9965: No
280 - 12 Mar 2024 12:49PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
281 - 12 Mar 2024 12:49PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
282 - 12 Mar 2024 12:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

372 - 12 Mar 2024 11:21AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: B.Tech. Mechanical  *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

The course includes Mechanics, Electronics, Aerodynamics, Aerospace, programming, etc which means you can still venture in the field of Aerospace Engineering through the course, Shall I explain the course in detail?
371 - 12 Mar 2024 11:18AM - +263 77 709 8241: Yes sure
372 - 12 Mar 2024 11:21AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: B.Tech. Mechanical  *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves.

379 - 08 Mar 2024 08:24AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Chantell.  I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with some work. I completely understand your concern here. However, as you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future.  To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
380 - 08 Mar 2024 08:29AM - +263 77 294 4709: Good morning, l appreciate ur concern but is it normal for universities to take such a long time to issue scholarships. To my understanding according to the info tht l got frm Edofa it takes btwn 3 to 5 days, this where it takes months is news to me

382 - 12 Mar 2024 09:39AM - +263 77 294 4709: THE Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education (ZIMCHE) has announced the removal of seven universities in India and Cyprus from the official list of institutions accredited with the quality assurance and standards body.  This follows last week’s order to the shadowy International Institute of Philanthropy (IlP) to immediately revoke honorary Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees issued to high-profile individuals.  In a statement this Monday, ZIMCHE said following a review of the accreditation status of various foreign higher education institutions, the seven were struck off the list, although no reasons were given.  “This notice serves to inform the public that the following institutions are no longer accredited with ZIMCHE; Girne American University (Northern Cyprus), Sharda University of India, Parul University (India), Near East University (Northern Cyprus), University of Kyrenia (Northern Cyprus), The European University of Lefke (Northern Cyprus) and University of Nicosia (Northern Cyprus).   “In light of the development, we strongly advise members of the public to verify the accreditation status of foreign universities they intend to enrol with or consider for their children’s university education.  “Studying at an unaccredited institution may result in financial loss and has serious implications for one’s academic qualifications and career prospects,” reads the notice.  ZIMCHE recently invalidated dubious IIP awards bestowed on various prominent citizens, including Zanu PF apologists and benefactors.  In a statement last Friday, ZIMCHE boldly asserted IIP’s awarding of honorary degrees violates Zimbabwean laws, specifically section 75(3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 20) Act, 2013, and section 10(1) of the Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education Act (Chapter 25:27). These statutes prohibit unregistered institutions from offering degrees.  As a result, ZIMCHE declared IIP’s awarded degrees unrecognised within Zimbabwe and cautioned the public against using titles such as “doctor” from outlawed institutions.  “We take the integrity of the higher education system in Zimbabwe very seriously, and will not tolerate any attempts to undermine it,” ZIMCHE said.  IIP was ordered to withdraw all conferred degrees and inform recipients accordingly publicly.  Several high-profile people, including Kambucha Beverages director Eric Francis Niyonsaba, musician Mudiwa Hood, controversial businessman Dilesh Nguwaya of Drax International and Geo Pomona Waste Management, who has links to the First Family, were recently awarded degrees by IIP.  Others are Midlands businesswoman Smelly Dube, Fatima Maruta, and Paul Shambare, who were honoured with Honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters (DHL) by IIP at a recent ceremony in Harare, presided over by Enrico Maverick, IIP’s country representative known for distributing questionable awards.  NewZimbabwe.com has it on good authority that would-be recipients of the fake doctorates were asked to pay a staggering US$1 000 to attend the conferment ceremony in Harare. Those who failed to pay were automatically excluded from getting the counterfeit qualifications.

Elaborate your answer.    Social structure refers to the patterned relationships, roles, institutions and norms that shape and constrain individual behavior within a society. It provides a framework within which individuals interact, make decisions and carry out actions. Social structure is not merely a figment of our imaginations, it is a tangible and concrete aspects of society that influences and guides the behavior and actions of individuals.  While society is a complex and dynamic entity composed of diverse individuals, groups and institutions, it is not simply a product of our imaginations. Society exists independently of individual perceptions and experiences and it's structures and systems have real impacts on our lives. Social structures such as institutions, organizations, laws and cultural norms play a crucial role in shaping our behaviors, choices and interactions with others.  Individual actions within a society are influenced and constrained by social forces, power dynamics and historical context. However, individuals also have agency and the capacity to challenge, resist and reshape.
152 - 12 Mar 2024 11:04AM - +263 78 341 4424: 3. Please explain the relation between sociology and economics.  Sociology and economics are two social sciences that different aspects of society, but they are closely related disciplines that both study human behavior and societal institutions. Sociology focuses on the social aspects of human behavior which economics focuses on the economic aspects.  The two disciplines intersect in areas such as the study of consumer behavior, labour markets, income inequality and social stratification. Sociology provides insights into the social forces that shape economic behavior, such as cultural norms, social structures and power dynamics. Economics, in turn provides insights into the material conditions that shape social behavior such as resource allocation, production and distribution.  Overall the relationship between sociology and economics is essential for understanding how individuals and societies interact economically and socially.
153 - 12 Mar 2024 11:04AM - +263 78 341 4424: 4. What is the role of institutions in society do they perform positive functions, or simple work in interests of the powerful and against the powerless?elaborate with exaple.  The role of institutions in society is complex and can vary depending on the specific institution and its context. While some institutions perform positive functions that contribute to the well-being and progress of the society, others may prioritize the interests of the powerful and perpetuate inequalities.  Positive functions of institutions include providing essential services such as education, Healthcare and infrastructure. For example educational institutions play a crucial role in imparting knowledge and skills, empowering individuals and fostering social mobility. Similarly healthcare institutions provide and promote public health contribution to the overall well-being of the community.  However, it is also true that some institutions may work in the interests of the powerful, potentially disadvantaging the powerless. This can be seen in instances where institutions reinforce systemic inequalities and maintain power imbalances. For example, certain legal and judicial institutions may exhibit bias and discrimination, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities and reinforcing social injustices.  It is important to note that institutions can have both positive and negative aspects and their impact on society can be influenced by various factors, including governance, transparency and public accountability. Evaluating the role of institutions requires a careful analysis of their specific functions, structures and the broader social, economic and political context in which they operate.
154 - 12 Mar 2024 11:04AM - +263 78 341 4424: 5. Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with the examples about in groups and out groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.    Primary groups are small intimate and long - lasting social groups characterized by close relationships, emotional bonds and strong social ties. Examples of primary groups include families, close friends and small communities. In primary groups, members often share personal relationships, values and experiences and provide emotional support, belonging and intimacy to one another.  Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal and less intimate social group characterized by formal task oriented relationships. Examples of secondary groups include classmates, colleagues at work and members of organizations. In secondary groups, members come together for specific purposes such as achieving goals, completing tasks or pursuing common interests. In-groups and out groups are subtypes of both primary and secondary groups that define boundaries and establish social identities with a group. In-groups are groups to which individuals belong and with which they identify often leading to feelings of belonging, loyalty and camaraderie. Out-groups, on the other hand are groups to which individuals do not belong or identify with. Out-groups may be based on factors such as competing, interests, conflicting values or social divisions.  Understanding the dynamics of primary and secondary groups as well as the concepts of in-groups and out groups helps sociologists analyze the various social interactions, relationships and dynamics that shape individual behavior, group cohesion and social identity within societies.

65 - 12 Mar 2024 01:16PM - +263 77 931 6003: We can now continue with the session
66 - 12 Mar 2024 01:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
67 - 12 Mar 2024 01:20PM - +263 77 931 6003: I'm ready
71 - 12 Mar 2024 01:24PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
72 - 12 Mar 2024 01:25PM - +263 77 931 6003: All clear
73 - 12 Mar 2024 01:25PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
74 - 12 Mar 2024 01:26PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
75 - 12 Mar 2024 01:26PM - +263 77 931 6003: I am following
76 - 12 Mar 2024 02:20PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
77 - 12 Mar 2024 02:20PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
78 - 12 Mar 2024 02:37PM - +263 77 931 6003: All clear
79 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

217 - 12 Mar 2024 11:52AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form it is duly noted with us. May I know if you were able to go through my messages above?
218 - 12 Mar 2024 11:57AM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes that's true
219 - 12 Mar 2024 11:58AM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes l was able to go through them ma'am Kirti.
220 - 12 Mar 2024 12:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
221 - 12 Mar 2024 12:19PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
222 - 12 Mar 2024 12:19PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
223 - 12 Mar 2024 02:01PM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes thank you Ms Kirti. If l may ask ma'am how long does it take for the offer letter to arrive l mean approximately irregardless that universities differ.
224 - 12 Mar 2024 02:13PM - Kirti Edoofa: It depends upon the university how much time they take for the evaluation, the standard time is for a week.",No,No

51 - 01 Mar 2024 07:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?

60 - 12 Mar 2024 10:32AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263775217510 thank you for sharing your concerns, I understand where you are coming from let me help you understand one by one, after asking for Tinotenda's result the EWYL team got occupied with the Africa trip and the response was really overwhelming. However, I was able to connect with the EWYL team and they informed me that there has been no response in the EWYL group from your side,  may I know why is that so?

63 - 12 Mar 2024 10:44AM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe you are confused here, the fee that you are talking about is the edoofa enrollment fee which is $350 which you paid to enroll with us, so that you can utilize the benefits and services we provide to you and if you are keen to know more about your credits you can directly ask your EWYL mentor about the same, may I know if you ever tried asking your credits from your mentor?

The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
108 - 11 Mar 2024 03:53PM - Academic Board: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?

5 - 12 Mar 2024 01:23PM - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
6 - 12 Mar 2024 01:23PM - Arshita: Okay so Chipo, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling. Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

85 - 12 Mar 2024 11:44AM - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
86 - 12 Mar 2024 11:44AM - Arshita: <Media omitted>
87 - 12 Mar 2024 11:44AM - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
88 - 12 Mar 2024 02:40PM - +263 71 883 2515: Umm no. Im in family of 6 children so it will become difficult as my parents helps my siblings to finish their academic too

Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?

93 - 12 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
94 - 12 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating?

128 - 12 Mar 2024 04:05PM - Arshita: Our admissions team will help you with it
129 - 12 Mar 2024 04:05PM - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

134 - 12 Mar 2024 05:37PM - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

321 - 12 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Gurvinder: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often. So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
322 - 12 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Gurvinder: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
323 - 12 Mar 2024 11:51AM - +263 71 266 0684: Well said thank you.
324 - 12 Mar 2024 12:48PM - Gurvinder: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in the Edoofa Acceptance letter?
325 - 12 Mar 2024 01:07PM - +263 71 965 5738: March 18 for the 200 and  April 18 for the remaining 150

329 - 12 Mar 2024 01:37PM - Gurvinder: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
330 - 12 Mar 2024 01:45PM - +263 71 965 5738: Number 2
331 - 12 Mar 2024 02:25PM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
332 - 12 Mar 2024 02:25PM - Gurvinder: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
333 - 12 Mar 2024 02:25PM - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore  ACC NUMBER: 5290638027654065  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664

The aspirants having a strong evaluation and analytical skills can be a good fit for this course.

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills. A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are: *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates. *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

117 - 12 Mar 2024 03:27PM - Gurvinder: @263773471142, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
118 - 12 Mar 2024 03:28PM - +263 77 347 1142: Ok.noted
119 - 12 Mar 2024 03:44PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics  *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

122 - 12 Mar 2024 11:58AM - Gurvinder: Lissa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

42 - 12 Mar 2024 12:43PM - Gurvinder: Your passion for making a difference in the lives of people, particularly the vulnerable, is truly commendable and aligns closely with the objectives of social work. However, pursuing a law degree alongside or instead of social work can offer unique advantages and opportunities to achieve these goals:  Advocacy and Legal Support: As a lawyer, you'll have the ability to advocate for individuals and communities in legal settings, ensuring that their rights are protected and that they have access to justice. Your legal training will enable you to navigate complex legal systems, challenge discrimination, and seek redress for injustices, complementing the direct support and assistance provided through social work.  Policy and Systemic Change: Lawyers play a crucial role in shaping social policies and laws that impact vulnerable populations. With a background in law, you can influence policy decisions, advocate for systemic reforms, and address the root causes of social issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This systemic approach can complement the individual-focused interventions of social work and lead to broader, long-term impact.  Combating Injustice and Inequality: Law offers a powerful tool for addressing systemic injustices and inequalities in society. By pursuing a career in law, you can work to change discriminatory laws and practices, challenge systemic barriers to social justice, and promote equality under the law for all individuals, including the most vulnerable members of society.  Diverse Career Opportunities: A law degree opens up diverse career opportunities beyond traditional legal practice. You can work in areas such as public interest law, human rights advocacy, policy analysis, legislative drafting, and international development, allowing you to make a difference in various fields and contexts.  Interdisciplinary Approach: Law is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with various disciplines, including sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary perspective enhances your understanding of social issues and equips you with a holistic approach to addressing complex social problems, complementing the skills and knowledge gained through social work training.  Overall, while social work is a noble and valuable profession, pursuing a law degree can offer additional avenues for making a difference, advocating for social justice, and effecting meaningful change at both the individual and systemic levels. By combining the insights and skills of both disciplines, you can enhance your ability to create positive impact and contribute to building a more just and equitable society.

42 - 12 Mar 2024 12:43PM - Gurvinder: Your passion for making a difference in the lives of people, particularly the vulnerable, is truly commendable and aligns closely with the objectives of social work. However, pursuing a law degree alongside or instead of social work can offer unique advantages and opportunities to achieve these goals:  Advocacy and Legal Support: As a lawyer, you'll have the ability to advocate for individuals and communities in legal settings, ensuring that their rights are protected and that they have access to justice. Your legal training will enable you to navigate complex legal systems, challenge discrimination, and seek redress for injustices, complementing the direct support and assistance provided through social work.  Policy and Systemic Change: Lawyers play a crucial role in shaping social policies and laws that impact vulnerable populations. With a background in law, you can influence policy decisions, advocate for systemic reforms, and address the root causes of social issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This systemic approach can complement the individual-focused interventions of social work and lead to broader, long-term impact.  Combating Injustice and Inequality: Law offers a powerful tool for addressing systemic injustices and inequalities in society. By pursuing a career in law, you can work to change discriminatory laws and practices, challenge systemic barriers to social justice, and promote equality under the law for all individuals, including the most vulnerable members of society.  Diverse Career Opportunities: A law degree opens up diverse career opportunities beyond traditional legal practice. You can work in areas such as public interest law, human rights advocacy, policy analysis, legislative drafting, and international development, allowing you to make a difference in various fields and contexts.  Interdisciplinary Approach: Law is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with various disciplines, including sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary perspective enhances your understanding of social issues and equips you with a holistic approach to addressing complex social problems, complementing the skills and knowledge gained through social work training.  Overall, while social work is a noble and valuable profession, pursuing a law degree can offer additional avenues for making a difference, advocating for social justice, and effecting meaningful change at both the individual and systemic levels. By combining the insights and skills of both disciplines, you can enhance your ability to create positive impact and contribute to building a more just and equitable society.

26 - 12 Mar 2024 10:20AM - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Leiann, also do tell me whether you learnt about Leiann’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
27 - 12 Mar 2024 10:22AM - +263 71 592 6501: being honest she didn't tell me about her journey and experience
28 - 12 Mar 2024 10:38AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me share you about the program myself.
29 - 12 Mar 2024 10:38AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30 - 12 Mar 2024 10:38AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
31 - 12 Mar 2024 10:38AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
32 - 12 Mar 2024 10:38AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

33 - 12 Mar 2024 10:46AM - +263 71 592 6501: that's true
34 - 12 Mar 2024 10:55AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nokutenda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
35 - 12 Mar 2024 11:04AM - +263 71 592 6501: l don't think so ,lm lacking number *2*
36 - 12 Mar 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: May I know, why is that the case?

We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

19 - 12 Mar 2024 12:44PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Tanaka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

21 - 12 Mar 2024 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Now Tanaka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

268 - 12 Mar 2024 10:07AM - +263 71 674 5048: I just wanna confirm , the only costs that l am going to endure here in Zimbabwe are enrollment costs only amounting to $350
269 - 12 Mar 2024 10:08AM - +263 71 674 5048: Can the enrollment fee be paid in hard cash and where are the offices such that those transactions can be made
274 - 12 Mar 2024 10:34AM - +263 71 674 5048: So sir about admission fee . So is that payment process  going to take place in August and the amount is specifically $500 . Correct me if l am wrong
275 - 12 Mar 2024 10:42AM - Gurvinder: Please the registration fees can be variable, and the deadline mentioned for that will be specified by the University itself.
276 - 12 Mar 2024 10:43AM - +263 71 674 5048: Ok
277 - 12 Mar 2024 10:47AM - Gurvinder: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
278 - 12 Mar 2024 11:03AM - +263 77 698 6054: Ok,2
279 - 12 Mar 2024 12:30PM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
280 - 12 Mar 2024 12:30PM - Gurvinder: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
281 - 12 Mar 2024 12:30PM - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore  ACC NUMBER: 5290638027654065  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664

290 - 12 Mar 2024 03:40PM - +263 71 674 5048: You once said that our fee is charged annually . Is there a room for those who wish to pay  slowly for example be it monthly or half yearly . Is it possible  to do so.
291 - 12 Mar 2024 03:47PM - Gurvinder: Please, that will depend on the University itself.

The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 15 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

27 - 12 Mar 2024 10:47AM - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.  You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

64 - 12 Mar 2024 12:52PM - +27 78 367 9466: Some needed  application fee so that your  application  can be processed..... I feared that I might  make my short  and results  in my parents  losing  money that could  have been useful, these days there a tonnes of scams on internet. Hence I was afraid
65 - 12 Mar 2024 12:57PM - Harmehak: I do understand, what you are sharing, Romeo!
66 - 12 Mar 2024 12:57PM - Harmehak: So what are your financial preparations for your higher education?
67 - 12 Mar 2024 01:09PM - +27 78 367 9466: My parents were not prepared, my dad lost everything during the Covid period so he has been struggling for jobs ..... we can only spare 1077 dollars for preparations ...... under very tight conditions
68 - 12 Mar 2024 01:25PM - Harmehak: I do understand, Romeo.
69 - 12 Mar 2024 01:26PM - Harmehak: Romeo, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
70 - 12 Mar 2024 01:44PM - +27 78 367 9466: It is true, ma'am, it is the reason  why I failed to enroll in zimbabwe  ...... it is even merely  impossible to make that much money in zimbabwe

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
264 - 12 Mar 2024 10:26AM - Harmehak: Dear parent, now that you have followed the entire discussion and the process,  Given the finances and the details of the program, are you willing to support your child both mentally and financially?  If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.

272 - 12 Mar 2024 01:16PM - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors  1. Student himself/herself 2. FAMILY 3. EDOOFA PROGAM  Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs.  Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
273 - 12 Mar 2024 01:16PM - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education.  *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*",No,No

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

95 - 12 Mar 2024 11:26AM - +263 78 709 8440: I don`t understand much about Earn While You Learn program, please help me sir.
96 - 12 Mar 2024 11:33AM - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

100 - 12 Mar 2024 12:00PM - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Alphios, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
101 - 12 Mar 2024 12:10PM - +263 77 236 7435: Yes we are going to support him were necessary if possible
102 - 12 Mar 2024 12:23PM - +263 78 709 8440: Just because of economic instability and some difficulties in our beloved country Zimbabwe, my guardians agreed to help me with the little that they will have where necessary if possible. To be honest with you sir, I believe that if I will have scholarship credits I will pay through Earn While You Learn program.
103 - 12 Mar 2024 12:40PM - +263 78 709 8440: I believe that Edoofa offers education for all and not only just the privilege of a few, hence I will work hard to get quality education despite the circumstances.

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
107 - 12 Mar 2024 02:23PM - +263 78 709 8440: Yes
108 - 12 Mar 2024 02:27PM - +263 78 709 8440: Alright sir, so I need to pay $350 for the Enrollment fee by end of this month?
104 - 12 Mar 2024 02:19PM - Keshav Edoofa: That is fantastic to hear Alphios!

109 - 12 Mar 2024 03:01PM - Keshav Edoofa: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:  *1. Guaranteed Scholarship* *2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities* *3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted* *4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student* *5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training* *6. Visa Assistance* *7. SLICE CON* *8. Department of Student Welfare* *9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
110 - 12 Mar 2024 03:10PM - +263 78 709 8440: Fine sir, but the truth is, we are facing financial challenges right now, maybe I will try to find it from other relatives.
111 - 12 Mar 2024 03:11PM - Keshav Edoofa: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
112 - 12 Mar 2024 03:14PM - +263 78 709 8440: That's good and encouraging
113 - 12 Mar 2024 03:16PM - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!",No,Yes

51 - 12 Mar 2024 11:25AM - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
52 - 12 Mar 2024 11:25AM - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
53 - 12 Mar 2024 11:25AM - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food! <This message was edited>

172 - 12 Mar 2024 03:31PM - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
173 - 12 Mar 2024 03:31PM - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

174 - 12 Mar 2024 03:31PM - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics",No,Yes

13 - 12 Mar 2024 10:39AM - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14 - 12 Mar 2024 10:39AM - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15 - 12 Mar 2024 10:39AM - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
26 - 12 Mar 2024 11:01AM - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Delight, Mrs. Sibanda and Mr. Makesure, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27 - 12 Mar 2024 11:07AM - +263 78 644 0046: So what do we do my parents are always on the run, rarely get online during the day

285 - 12 Mar 2024 03:23PM - Keshav Edoofa: To proceed ahead for the eligibility interview stage you need to appear for a test which is of 30-45 minutes!
286 - 12 Mar 2024 03:23PM - Keshav Edoofa: *MAXIMUM MARKS: 50*  *_SECTION 1:- PERSONAL INFORMATION_*  Name as per School Record- Gender- Date of Birth as per School Record- Father's Name- Mother's Name- Email Address- Parent's email address-  *_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  *_SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* _*Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.*_ _*After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.*_  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway’s,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now. B) after sentence 1. C) after sentence 2. D) after sentence 3.  *_SECTION 4 MATHEMATICS_*  *1.	The use of a calculator is not permitted.* *2.

B  Section 5:  Whilst the wounds of genocide and atrocities committed during the moments of madness, life has  greatly improved. Rwanda has made great strides in development in many aspects of the economy.  In the health sector, there have been marked improvement in the health service. A lot of work has been done in HIV/Aids programs and general family health. There has been infrastructural developments with state of the art and modern day buildings. Hotels have been built and road networks have been built, resurfaced such that traveling on roads in Rwanda has become comfortable. Electricity that had been inconsistant has been vastly improved.  In agriculture, there has been more land put under cultivation, with production rising steadily such that Rwanda has become almost self sufficient in most agricultural produce. Peasant farming on a subsistance nature persists though.  Communication networks have greatly improved. Cellphones which were expensive and beyond, the reach of many, are now readily available at cheaper rates. There are various communication networks making it easier to communicate.  Tourism has also greatly improved. Hotels, Inns, Lodges and hospitality houses have been constructed. There is an influx of tourists to Rwanda making the industry thriving. Banks, supermarkets and ATMs are readily available, in stark contrast to the genocide years  Rwanda has opened it's doors to foreign investments. Companies from far as far afield as the United States, France and Canada are engaged in various forms in the industry.Employment has been created in both primary and manufacturing sectors, creating a feel good factor, optimism and generating much needed revenge for the government through taxes and tributes. Secondary service sectors have also experienced a boom as shops, supermarkets, restaurants and fast food outlets have been established.  Education is being awarded to as many areas which did not have it and schools have been built. Hospitals and clinics have been a great improvement in social services delivery. Sports stadiums have been built, and at schools sport is being encouraged at all levels  There are still pockets of poverty in Rwanda with at least 40 percent of the population living in small holding plots.There is certainly great development 16 years after genocide and there is great optimism that the target if becoming a middle class economy will be attained.  Section 6  ""My Inspiration Story""  My father Brian Kandiye is my inspiration . Being the eldest in a family of nine, he grew up with a mommoth task if being the yardstick of the family. Growing up in a middle class family in post independence, he did well at school excelling in sports, playing rugby for his province, Mashonaland Country Districts.  It is in the years after completion of tertiary education that he inspired me the most. Faced with a collapsed economy, escalating costs of living, vast unemployment, absolute poverty and an excessively devalued local currency, my father moved mountains and worked extra hard. He took up menial jobs, worked long hours to ensure that my sister and I, as well as his siblings all had enough to eat and all attended school. The sacrifice he made at a great detriment to his health has inspired me to work hard in school and aim as high as possible in life so as to ensure that my father can look at the achievements in my life attained via the sacrifices he made for me with pride.

23 - 12 Mar 2024 10:55AM - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24 - 12 Mar 2024 10:55AM - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
25 - 12 Mar 2024 10:55AM - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

83 - 12 Mar 2024 03:57PM - +263 77 341 4207: Well appreciated, awaiting to here from you
84 - 12 Mar 2024 03:58PM - Keshav Edoofa: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!

64 - 12 Mar 2024 04:24PM - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

32 - 12 Mar 2024 12:22PM - +263 78 069 9562: I am 19 years old. I studied at St Anthony's mission for both primary and secondary education. I was part of a quiz club back when I was still in form 1 and 2 but I quit when I realised I could not be present at other times since I was a day scholar. I was also staying with my grandparents so I had house chores to do, which made for a tight schedule. I am a man of science and I feel quite rejuvenated reading about it. I wish to be a mechanical engineer since I could be involved in a lot of science fields that way. I like to think my strengths are my vivid imagination and my ability to ignore normally offensive things people might say or do. As for weaknesses, that would be novels and internet, I could read all day which is quite a distraction. I particularly enjoy science fiction as it gives a lot of room for imagination. I also like gathering knowledge about how the science world is progressing especially astronomy and astrophysics. I stayed with my maternal grandparents who are currently 73 and 87 years old, grandmother and grandfather respectively, all the way till I finished high school. My father worked and still works as a salesperson in Harare. My mother passed when I was 2 and I had to stay with my grandparents. As for the nature of work, I am actually not quite sure myself about the smaller details.

99 - 12 Mar 2024 01:52PM - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly now can you tell me that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
100 - 12 Mar 2024 02:01PM - +263 77 262 2571: Thank you so much, I am personally passionate in computing.

As a person I think I will be able to improve the status of Zimbabwean companies in meeting the world class status.

The fact that I am learning at an urban school makes my chances very slim to get the scholarship because in this country it is believed that only rural students are poor not urban ones.

31 - 12 Mar 2024 03:35PM - Keshav Edoofa: You see Tania, being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.  Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work  Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.  So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?

37 - 12 Mar 2024 11:23AM - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tariro. have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
38 - 12 Mar 2024 11:23AM - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
39 - 12 Mar 2024 11:27AM - +263 78 818 7916: When I was in secondary school from form 1 to 4 and form 5 to 6 I was assisted by well wishers or sometimes bt the church and for now I  don't have anyone to assist my higher education
42 - 12 Mar 2024 11:55AM - Keshav Edoofa: Then how are they planning to go ahead with your higher education?
43 - 12 Mar 2024 11:57AM - +263 78 818 7916: For now it's difficult for me to say they have another plan because the most problem we have is financially problems

51 - 12 Mar 2024 03:13PM - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

53 - 12 Mar 2024 03:13PM - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

I study Mathematics, Phyics and Chemistry in the hope of pursuing into Medicinal Studies once I reach university.  My strengths in education include solving mathematical problems. I also consider myself very good at learning and understanding new things.  Although being very good at these traits, I would also consider myself weak at engaging with unfamiliar faces.  My hobbies include creating art, listening and imitating vocal pieces, reading novels.  My family background goes like this. The two people in this group are, for a fact, my real parents. The people that brought me in this world. We, as a family lived in Zimbabwe for the first four years of my existence. We moved to South Africa after I turned four. This was done to make it easier for my father to go to school as well as being close and intimate with his family. We lived in South Africa for eight years. I got the blessing of attending school there. We then returned to Zimbabwe so that we could live permanently in a more vivid and familiar environment, since South Africa was nolonger safe for us due to Xenophobia. My dad, however still lives in South Africa due to employment purposes. He still does come to visit every month. My father is a truck driver.

121 - 12 Mar 2024 03:03PM - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.  Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:  1. Social Worker A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.  2. Journalist For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.  3. Administrative Support Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.  4. Rehabilitation Counsellor If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.  5. Family Counsellor Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.  6. Survey Researcher As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.  7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.  8. Policy Analyst Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population  9. Media Planner A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

180 - 12 Mar 2024 04:45PM - Kunal: Indeed If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling. Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Aspiring social workers can embark on this path with a diverse range of academic backgrounds. Nevertheless, when considering the initial steps toward a career in social work, it is customary for students to opt for degrees in fields such as Sociology or Law. May I know what intrigues you more, please?

170 - 12 Mar 2024 04:16PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Essence. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?

Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
173 - 12 Mar 2024 06:42PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

248 - 12 Mar 2024 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
249 - 12 Mar 2024 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
250 - 12 Mar 2024 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

146 - 12 Mar 2024 12:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
147 - 12 Mar 2024 12:50PM - +263 77 434 0855: The cost for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship is just way too expensive, not affordable to ordinary people.
148 - 12 Mar 2024 12:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ms. Joan! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
197 - 12 Mar 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Simbarashe can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his parents?
198 - 12 Mar 2024 04:46PM - +263 77 434 0855: Wonderful
199 - 12 Mar 2024 04:48PM - +263 77 434 0855: This is well understood
200 - 12 Mar 2024 04:51PM - +263 77 434 0855: I can see and totally understand the idea of the Edoofian to be constantly in touch with the mentor for skills development
201 - 12 Mar 2024 04:52PM - +263 77 434 0855: Indeed
202 - 12 Mar 2024 06:41PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
203 - 12 Mar 2024 06:41PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
204 - 12 Mar 2024 06:41PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
205 - 12 Mar 2024 08:20PM - +263 77 434 0855: All the 4 points are greatly appreciated and very important in their own way.
206 - 12 Mar 2024 08:23PM - +263 77 434 0855: Guaranteed minimum scholarship of 50-100%, an opportunity for the students to be able to save up to a thousand dollars plus through waiver...",No,Yes

60 - 12 Mar 2024 09:19AM - +263 71 436 3553: I always wanted to work in the mining field and l love doing activities that deal with minerals
61 - 12 Mar 2024 10:04AM - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on your answer/
62 - 12 Mar 2024 10:14AM - +263 77 808 0568: I love doing things that link up with nature and that's my dream job
63 - 12 Mar 2024 10:40AM - Shubham Madhwal: Mining engineering is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining engineering will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line.  One of the primary reasons why mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment.
64 - 12 Mar 2024 10:40AM - Shubham Madhwal: In addition, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering. As technology improves, these other fields are becoming more efficient and effective in the development of new products and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness can lead to a decrease in the demand for materials that are extracted and processed by mining engineers.  Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining engineers and other professionals in the field.
65 - 12 Mar 2024 10:40AM - Shubham Madhwal: In conclusion, mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining engineers may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

I am here to discuss the application of Salome  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
14 - 12 Mar 2024 01:18PM - +263 78 239 2737: It's a big honour to address my own concerns about Edoofa Scholarship Program. l have heard about this program since last year and that inspired me to be part and pass of this program and also when the Edoofa members came to our school this year l got motivated through the work and fliers of the Edoofa school and somehow l started dreaming big seeing myself representing Zimbabwe and making India famous as well through the opportunity of Edoofa thank you
15 - 12 Mar 2024 01:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
16 - 12 Mar 2024 01:18PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the lowest annual Fee Possible
17 - 12 Mar 2024 01:21PM - +263 78 239 2737: I understand

164 - 12 Mar 2024 11:36AM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
165 - 12 Mar 2024 11:36AM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
166 - 12 Mar 2024 11:36AM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

249 - 12 Mar 2024 02:55PM - +263 77 308 0565: Ohh okay
250 - 12 Mar 2024 02:56PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.

74 - 12 Mar 2024 04:37PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
