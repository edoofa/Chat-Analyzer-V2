20/1/24, 1:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Congratulations on your recent achievements! It's wonderful to hear more about your background and journey. Being the firstborn in a family of five siblings must come with its own set of responsibilities, and your dedication to your education is truly commendable.

A huge congratulations are in order for successfully completing your Malawi School Certificate of Education with 14 points—that's an outstanding accomplishment! Your hard work and commitment have undoubtedly paid off.

Receiving an offer letter from Quest University through the Edoofa scholarship is a significant milestone. This opportunity opens up new horizons for your academic and personal growth. I'm genuinely thrilled for you and the exciting journey that lies ahead.
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you
20/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I don’t understand
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/1/24, 1:45 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Understood
20/1/24, 1:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you for the introduction
20/1/24, 1:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well noted
20/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/1/24, 1:55 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes it is
20/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

20/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

22/1/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up for today and look forward to connecting tomorrow.🌺
22/1/24, 2:32 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am still reading it but am almost done
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We will discuss it tomorrow.
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Alright
23/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon on this beautiful day!✨
Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 1:34 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Good afternoon to you too, am doing fine how about you 

Let’s proceed
23/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: So my understanding is : the Earn While You Learn program is a program designed to make Edoofians to acquire the 21st century skills while they are still at school and these can help the to be the best after graduation. Through this program Edoofians also earn some credit that can be used to reduce their scholarship fees. The three ways how money can be gained are: first through Corporate Alliances and under this Edoofians are connected to the companies from their mother country and then work with them hand in hand and there good performance makes them to earn the credits. Second is through community where Edoofians try to advertise the Edoofa works to other students and if they are able to make a student reach the enrollment process and the students manages to pay it money is gained by the Edoofa and finally until when the student finishes all the processes credits are also gained. Finally through the African Schools Education Reform mission where an Edoofa gives names of a school from their mother country including the school they were and Edoofa contacts those schools and if the schools accept Edoofa and a student is also able to apply for the enrollment fee credits are also gained by the Edoofian.
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic, Kelvin!
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am done
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: We can now proceed
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: The Corparate alliance is meant to gain the wider understanding of the outside world markets. This is done online. This done by identifying companies from one’s mother’s country or the regions they are. These companies can be identified by acquiring it from family or friends or the internet by downloading a linked account and share them the objectives of Edoofa under this program and they can be able to connect you to the companies and work hand in hand with them. This can make the Edoofaians to increase their chances of getting jobs after education and even gain the experience of the outside world and how the companies are operating.
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
23/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.
23/1/24, 2:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you it’s also great to learn all these things about the EWYL Program
23/1/24, 2:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Does this mean that l need to share my understanding about the document tomorrow?
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Alright
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Continue having a great day see you tomorrow for the next lesson

Am doing great how about you

Yes am ready
24/1/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
24/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Here is my understanding : before a person get to connect a company there are some factors that are to be considered. These factors are: 1 Nature of the company where we look if the company is able and welling to connect with Edoofa and has an understanding of the Corporate alliance. 2 Scale of the company where the company doesn’t need to have a large number or a small number of employees but just a good level. 3 Financial stability where the company is able to support its self in its operations. 4 Background of the founders the founders need to have a good background on their success and achievements and a good example l can give are the two founders of Edoofa who really show their goals and achievements. After looking into these factors we then good to the process of connecting to companies. The steps are: 1 Searching , during these process platforms like LinkedIn , google, social medias like facebook, instagram and twitter are used to search for these companies using some key words. 2 Getting some understanding of the companies like it’s past collaborations and some of its functions in this case google can be used. 3 Getting to the websites of the companies to also know alot about the company and in this case if the has an app download it and get to know better about the company. 4 Checking the various social media pages of the company as the company will post their activities and more about the which can make one to understand it more. 5 Knowing more about the founders of the company like their achievements and their goals too. Finally after checking all these send a request to the company but through the heads of departments which can be an easier way to get the response back.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

STUDENT -  Community building just as the name suggests this is the process where Edoofians try to build a community where people have the same goals and are willing to work together. In this process Edoofians are given the chance to share with their friends and families that have just finished their second level of education about the Edoofa scholarships. And if these people are willing to the Edoofa the students are then connected to the Edoofa team to learn more about Edoofa and to be assessed to see if they are wealthy for the Edoofa programs. Upon the payment of the enrollment fee after the student is found eligible. 20 dollars is then given to the Edoofian that guided the other student about Edoofa. Then the 30 dollars is earned after finishing all the formalities of the scholarship.
25/1/24, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

So are you ready for the session?🚀
29/1/24, 1:37 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes am ready
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well understood
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*KELVIN/ADITI*
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/1/24, 1:59 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Understood
29/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/1/24, 2:12 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well understood
29/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/1/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Malawi, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.

On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/1/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
31/1/24, 2:26 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Just a question to ask before l fill out the form
This form is asking about time for the meeting and l haven’t yet talked to the headmaster to arrange for the meeting
31/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Kelvin, a headmaster should fill this form.
31/1/24, 2:27 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well understood
31/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

1/2/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Understood
1/2/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
1/2/24, 2:26 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

6/2/24, 1:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!🌞 Let's begin our session with positive vibes, productivity, and delightful surprises.
I apologize for my absence as I wasn't feeling well and couldn't be online for the past 2-3 days, but now I am feeling better so let's commence our sessions.
6/2/24, 1:31 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Good afternoon to you too
Am glad that you are now fine and doing better
Let’s begin
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
6/2/24, 1:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor.
6/2/24, 1:34 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Noted
6/2/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
6/2/24, 1:38 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am not quite sure about the 3 stages
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
6/2/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
6/2/24, 1:41 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Well understood
6/2/24, 1:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes am still in contact with them
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will *not* be addressing your admission queries
6/2/24, 1:44 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Noted
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s very clear
6/2/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Understood
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Kelvin, this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you
6/2/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Malawi region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.
6/2/24, 3:09 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yeah the news are there of the cholera outbreak but so far my loved are all doing well and l haven’t heard that someone in my family has been affected.
 
That will be great opportunity to know me better. Am really glad.
6/2/24, 3:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Ohh that's a relief!
I am happy that you all are safe.
6/2/24, 3:17 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you
22/2/24, 12:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Kelvin!
Hope you are well.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 12:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.

About the classes am not quite sure which classes you are saying that l have been missing because the last message l received was a phone number and you told me that l may start my classes yesterday and yesterday l was waiting for you but l didn’t hear anything from you. Maybe there has been a miscommunication between us.
