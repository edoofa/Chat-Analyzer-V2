31/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I am great. Thanks for asking.
31/1/24, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
31/1/24, 8:47 AM - +265 999 95 37 21: Good morning
Myself and Dr Elizabeth Gomani Chindebvu are parents to Dalitso Chindebvu. The others must be your colleagues at Edoofa.
31/1/24, 8:55 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Is there anything else you would like to know?
31/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with you. I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey
31/1/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
31/1/24, 9:02 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: My parents have always encouraged me to work hard so that I should not live a struggling life in the future. Thus my primary goal is to build a stable foundation that I can stand on while supporting those around me whenever I am needed. 

The EWYL program gives me the opportunity to learn interactive skills while building my connections with people. It also allows me to lessen the financial burden on my parents
31/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's truly commendable to have such a strong and supportive foundation from your parents. Your dedication to building a stable future and supporting those around you is inspiring. The Earn While You Learn program aligns perfectly with your goals, providing not only interactive skills but also easing the financial load on your parents. This dual benefit will undoubtedly contribute to your personal and professional growth. Wishing you success in your endeavors!
31/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much. I am looking forward to it.
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I am not certain if I do know the objective, could you tell me more?
31/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
31/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/1/24, 9:11 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand the objectives of the program
31/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
31/1/24, 9:16 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Glad to get to know them. I am in your care and I am grateful for their time.
31/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
31/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
31/1/24, 9:30 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes, it does draw my interest a lot
31/1/24, 9:49 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So as the session time is over we are concluding our discussion, let's meet tomorrow for an engaging session🌟

1/2/24, 8:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @265888899209

1/2/24, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let's begin with today's session🚀
1/2/24, 8:29 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Good morning 
I am ready to proceed with today's session
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, that's amazing!!
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 8:45 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: This is really mind opening and inspirational. The questions are  so deep and it let's one adjust their point of view
1/2/24, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
1/2/24, 8:47 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: It would be an honour.
1/2/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
1/2/24, 8:50 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: This sounds fantastic.
1/2/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, now I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
1/2/24, 8:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
1/2/24, 9:05 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: 1. My EWYL mentor is Ms. Adit, other members of the EWYL team include; the Head of the Department, Ms. Sanjana and the Head coach Ms. Davi

2. My mentor has set three goals for me; firstly, to ensure that my academic journey is great. Secondly, to provide me with enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education in India. Lastly, to help me learn and evolve with relevant 21st venture skills that will prepare me for the real world workplace and grow holistically.

3. Mr. Angad Singh interacts with the Edoofians through Newsletters

4. The hall of inspiration is where aspiring students who have shown brilliantly resulting or inspiring achievement share their stories so that they can motivate their fellow students.
1/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
1/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

6/2/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/2/24, 9:04 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Cooperate alliance I will gain an understanding of the market I will enter at an early stage have to connect Edoofa with Technology development and digital companies in my region.

6/2/24, 4:26 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: When searching for companies I should keep in mind of the nature of the company, it should be student-centric or recreational.

8/2/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/2/24, 8:59 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I will make sure to be as active as possible and respond swiftly when I understand and ask where I am confused.
8/2/24, 9:00 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand the breakdown
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*DALITSO/ADITI*
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
8/2/24, 9:17 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand

8/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/2/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Malawi, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.

On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

8/2/24, 9:21 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I will make sure they get the information

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

12/2/24, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/2/24, 9:12 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: In this project I have to reach out to local schools in my region and tell them about the Edoofa scholarship program. I can make a list of several schools and arrange meetings between the school's headmaster and the Edoofa programme director

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
22/2/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
22/2/24, 9:18 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I will send the information when he replies

26/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
26/2/24, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
26/2/24, 9:04 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes I am very excited to learn more
26/2/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
26/2/24, 9:08 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Could you explain it in detail a bit
26/2/24, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure so here is a brief about these terms:

26/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
26/2/24, 9:18 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: It seems simple enough
26/2/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I will send them when they have been made
26/2/24, 9:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We are concluding today's session. We will reconvene tomorrow for our session.🚀
26/2/24, 9:41 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Have a Lovely day
27/2/24, 9:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Dalitso!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me as I was unable to take your session as it coincided with a team meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for your understanding.
27/2/24, 10:08 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: It's alright I understand
27/2/24, 7:16 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61552706273184&mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v
28/2/24, 7:54 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Dalitso!
Hope you are well.

During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

In light of this, I have decided to reschedule our sessions to Monday through Friday from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM. This schedule change will ensure more productive sessions, and I look forward to seeing you today at the new time! <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 8:04 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Understood
28/2/24, 1:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for today's session?🚀
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: Hello yes I am ready for today's session
28/2/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
28/2/24, 2:17 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: That is very beneficial for me
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Dalitso, this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
28/2/24, 2:26 PM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand I'll wait
28/2/24, 4:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/2/24, 7:27 PM - +265 999 95 37 21: Good evening
I see that there was no session today.
1/3/24, 8:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well.

I hope that you have gone through this thoroughly.
1/3/24, 8:08 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: Good morning. I am alright thank you
Hope you are fine as well.

Yes, I went over it thoroughly
1/3/24, 8:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Then you must know that the new schedule will be shared shortly.
1/3/24, 8:11 AM - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand
