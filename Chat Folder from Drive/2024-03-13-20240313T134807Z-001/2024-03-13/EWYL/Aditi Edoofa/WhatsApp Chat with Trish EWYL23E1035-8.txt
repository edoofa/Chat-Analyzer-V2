26/12/23, 8:53 AM - +27 74 372 5998: Good morning Ms Aditi I'm Mr Killian u are welcome
26/12/23, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @27624990315 @27743725998 Your support for Trish on her EWYL journey is invaluable, and I'm sure it will contribute to her success.
26/12/23, 8:57 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
26/12/23, 9:06 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Well Ms Aditi, my long term goal is to go study in India at the best institution pursuing my course which is Bachelor of science in physiotherapy and get my degree. After obtaining my degree, I also dream of having my own medical practice as a qualified physiotherapist. The EWYL program will create a platform for me to gain more knowledge, skills and experience that will prepare me for the world of work . By earning scholarship credits, I will be able to self finance my education which will give me a sense of independence. Above all what makes this journey exciting is that I will be guided by  my mentor which is you throughout the journey which gives me more hope and dedication believing that I will be able to achieve this long term goal 🤗
26/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your aspirations are truly commendable! Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy and eventually establishing your own medical practice reflect a strong commitment to your education and future career. I'm excited to be your mentor and support you on this journey. Together, we'll work towards achieving your goals, and the EWYL program is indeed an excellent opportunity for you to gain the knowledge and experience needed.🚀
26/12/23, 9:10 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Thank you 😊🤗your dedication is truly appreciated and I'm so excited to be guided by you on this journey Ms Aditi 🤗
26/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome Trish!
26/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I'm not really sure Ms Aditi 🤗
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I understand Ms Aditi 🙃🤝
26/12/23, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/12/23, 9:20 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I would like to greet Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi and I truly appreciate their dedication to support young ambitious students like me to pursue their dreams in order to achieve our goals 🤝 Thank you
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
They are also honored to have you!
26/12/23, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
26/12/23, 9:24 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Very interesting 🤗🤗
26/12/23, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/12/23, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound ?
28/12/23, 8:34 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Sounds interesting and exciting 🤗 thank you so much
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
28/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - +27 67 235 2935: 1.On my EWYL team, I have my dearest mentor Ms Aditi , I have Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the Department and Ms Davi the Head coach.

2.My mentor has set up three goals for my EWYL journey which are:
-To make sure that my academic journey is great 
- To ensure that I am given enough opportunities to self finance my higher education in India and lastly
-To work towards attaining the objective (which involves learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills in order to prepare me for the real world work place and to grow.

3.A.Newsletter

4.The Hall of inspiration according to my understanding is a  part of the newsletter where Edoofians like me get to learn and be motivated by receiving and reading words of inspiration from Mr Angad Singh and where we get to learn and reflect from other Edoofians and their experiences.
The Hall of inspiration also shares motivational quotes 🤗
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is fantastic, Trish!❤️

29/12/23, 8:52 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I understand 😊 Ms Aditi however as I mentioned that I do have some concerns about all the projects which I believe could be a problem for me
29/12/23, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, would you please elaborate on that.
29/12/23, 9:29 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Alright 😊 thank you.
Well Ms Aditi, as I was studying all the projects in the EWYL program I realised that connecting with the companies and other students would be difficult for me even though I would be trying. The reason I am saying this is that I'm currently living in South Africa and it is during the holiday season and most companies I already had in mind are closed . The reason why I doubt that I could pull of the first project is that, the last time I checked, here in South Africa, living as a foreigner is very difficult because what's occuring recently is that the government and political parties are already deciding to remove all foreigners including Zimbabweans , Nigerians and etc. Most South African citizens are already claiming that foreigners are taking their jobs and they want nothing to do with them, this appeared on the recent news. I am a student who does my research very well   and I love taking risks but I  came to realise that going against certain laws will affect my future as a student considering that I am in a foreign country and there are events like xenophobia that takes place which has already affected some of us . Based on project 2 as I wanted to stay prepared already,  I remember applying for the Edoofa scholarship program and I even asked my school mates if they are interested and explaining how it works to them but their responses were very  difficult to answer myself. Most students here in South Africa get full funded scholarships and bursaries from the government considering their good grades and most of them told me that they are used to scholarships that fund fully and they are not used to 50%-100%scholarships as mentioned here in the Edoofa. I did not know how to answer that . I could have also applied here in South Africa but because I am not a South African citizen I did not qualify for all the bursaries that it is why I considered applying abroad and came across the Edoofa scholarship program. 
Most Schools and Organisations this side are most focused on funding and empowering their own citizens which would make it difficult for me to make them understand about this program and they might not take me seriously because I am a foreigner. Considering that most schools and most companies are closed it would be difficult to connect with them. Besides the South African issue, Most of my cousins and friends who are Zimbabweans who I think would want to enroll in the Edoofa program will be completing their secondary years in 2027 so it would be difficult for me.
I am really dedicated and I am willing to try and achieve these tasks but those are the difficulties I would be facing when I try to work on the projects 🤗 Hopefully you will understand thank you.
29/12/23, 9:30 AM - +27 67 235 2935: I apologize for taking too long🤗
29/12/23, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Allow me some time to go through this Trish and I will get back to you on this, okay?

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
2/1/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

The purpose of this project is to connect and build positive relationships with other people and work towards specific goals
2/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

2/1/24, 9:32 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, and you can surely reach out to your Zimbabwean friends okay?
2/1/24, 9:34 AM - +27 67 235 2935: So Ms Aditi, is it still ok if a student signs up for the program but will be completing their Secondary years in 2027 because that's the majority of the Zimbabweans friends that I am connected to?

4/1/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TRISH/ADITI*
4/1/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
4/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
4/1/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

4/1/24, 1:52 PM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted Ms Aditi 🤗but so far I haven't had any luck of finding the right students
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*.

Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.

4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:35 PM - +27 67 235 2935: I heard everything Ms Aditi. On this project I am required to identify secondary schools and connect the school headmaster with the Edoofa program. I am willing to also try this project too but however as I'm in South Africa it will also come with difficulties. I believe some of the questions they will ask  about my experience with Edoofa is which varsity will I be enrolling in India and of which I haven't received the offer letter from varsities yet and the scholarship percentage and I only qualified for the scholarship by passing the interview and eligibility Test and one of the questions I would have to expect of which some have already asked me this question is how do they know that my experience in India will be good when I haven't even went there. So I don't want to be tongue tied when I do the project.
4/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have. However I’ll explain this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.🌻
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - +27 67 235 2935: I have already mentioned the questions in this paragraph Ms Aditi 🤗🤗
4/1/24, 2:39 PM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted Ms Aditi 🤗thank you 🤝
4/1/24, 2:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, will get back to you in tomorrow's session.

5/1/24, 8:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
5/1/24, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's completely understandable that you may encounter questions regarding your experience with Edoofa, especially since you haven't received the offer letter from Indian universities yet. Here's a suggested response to address these potential questions:

Greetings Mr./Mrs./Ms.

Thank you for your questions. While I haven't received the offer letter from Indian universities as of now, my experience with Edoofa has been incredibly positive and promising. I qualified for the scholarship through a rigorous interview and eligibility test process, and this achievement reflects my commitment to academic excellence and personal growth.

Although I haven't physically been to India yet, Edoofa's comprehensive support and guidance have assured me of a smooth transition. Their dedicated team has been instrumental in providing valuable insights into the education system, cultural integration, and the overall experience of studying in India.

While I await the official offer letters, my interactions with Edoofa have instilled confidence in the quality of education they offer and the supportive environment they create for international students. I am optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead and excited about the prospect of enrolling in a reputable Indian university.

I am committed to sharing my journey and experiences with prospective students and believe that my association with Edoofa will contribute positively to their decision-making process.

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
5/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

5/1/24, 9:41 AM - +27 74 372 5998: Good morning Ms Aditi how are you hope you are doing good I'm Lillian's Father i have been following all your discussions with my daughter . Your project is good but now we have a challenge on it cz now schools are closed in South Africa until 17/18 January so it's difficult to find a way to meet school heads at the present moment and I'm sure it will be bit easier when schools reopens so i think it's better to start from there.Another challenge is most of South African students they get what they call NESFAS schoolarship free from their Government so to go abroad is something else to them and it takes a lot of understanding for someone to change that, infact for us to come to Edoofa we were researching for International Universities and Schoolarship czmy daughter applied for many Universities in South Africa and still no response from them I'm sure cz she is a foreigner dispite her qualifications though some of the Citizens she applied with already have accepted.
5/1/24, 3:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day, and thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your understanding of the challenges posed by the current school closures in South Africa. I completely agree that waiting until the schools reopen in mid-January would be a more practical approach.
5/1/24, 3:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And I totally get about the NESFAS scholarship but like your daughter there must be a lot of students who would be wanting to go the University but are not getting the opportunity, I would like her to keep trying to make the most out of the situation.
5/1/24, 6:22 PM - +27 67 235 2935: Good evening Ms Aditi, I know our session is over at this time but I have managed to connect with a student and told her about the scholarship program and the student asked for the Edoofa scholarship program link and I don't have it with me, please kindly share the link
6/1/24, 12:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day Trish!

When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
11/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing Trish, I am so proud of you.
11/1/24, 1:56 PM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted Ms Aditi 🤗I understand what is required. I have to inform you that schools in my region are public schools meaning there is no fees paid because the government pays for everything . Even my school is a public school but I will try

11/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, but it's important to try right?

 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

11/1/24, 2:25 PM - +27 67 235 2935: Not really 🤗you may explain further

Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your sessions will be on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
12/1/24, 8:45 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted 🤗
12/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
12/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/1/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
12/1/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/1/24, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/1/24, 8:49 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted 🙂
12/1/24, 8:49 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Should I text on the EWYL line now?🙃
12/1/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may!
12/1/24, 8:52 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/1/24, 8:55 AM - +27 67 235 2935: 🤗 alright
12/1/24, 8:55 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted 🤝🙂

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences

12/1/24, 8:58 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Noted 😆Ms Aditi
12/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
12/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 67 235 2935: Understood Ms Aditi 🙂
