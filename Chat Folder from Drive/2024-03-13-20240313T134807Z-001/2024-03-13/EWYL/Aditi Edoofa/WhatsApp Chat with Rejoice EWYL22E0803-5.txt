2/1/24, 12:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Rejoice

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 448 1283: Alright ma'am thanks for informing me
11/1/24, 4:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

It has come to my attention that you have not been attending your sessions recently on the EWYL Line. Your lack of response is concerning, and it is important that you communicate with me promptly.
Please provide an explanation for your absence from the sessions and let me know if there are any challenges.

8/3/24, 3:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, I see what happened. You were using a new number, and I had your old one, which caused confusion about you not following the ritual. Now that we've cleared that up, please ensure you are on time tomorrow. I am looking forward to having a session with you since long, Rejoice. <This message was edited>

I've come to understand that our previous session time wasn't as effective as it could be, so I've decided to reschedule our sessions to *8:00 AM.* This change aims to ensure that we make the most out of our time together and achieve greater productivity. Let's aim for fruitful sessions for your success.
