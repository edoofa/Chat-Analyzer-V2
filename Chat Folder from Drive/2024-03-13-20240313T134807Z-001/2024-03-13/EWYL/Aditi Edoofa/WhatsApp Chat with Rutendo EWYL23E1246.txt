Hope you are well.

Team Edoofa experienced a whirlwind over the past three days, with activities bustling in both India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24 event. After a brief moment to collect ourselves, we're ready to return to our original schedule and move forward in our journey. 
*Our session will commence today at 8:30 AM.*
22/2/24, 8:06 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Goodmorning to you as well . Noted .
22/2/24, 8:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So let's begin with today's session🚀
22/2/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Ready for the session.
22/2/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/2/24, 8:39 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So Rutendo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the Statement of Purpose. Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/2/24, 8:44 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Well my long term goals is to get a PhD in clinical psychology and then establish a clinic here in my home town that provides services to the people in my community  . I want to offer very affordable services in order for the my community to benefit from my education  . I think the EWYL Program will help me to achieve my goals because i will be able to give a helping hand  to my parents financially so that they will be able to afford for my tution fee until um done with my PhD without any failure.
22/2/24, 8:47 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals of obtaining a PhD in clinical psychology is incredibly admirable and impactful. It's clear that you have a strong commitment to both personal achievement and giving back to those around you.

Participating in the EWYL Program can indeed be instrumental in helping you achieve these goals by providing financial support to lessen the burden on your parents and ensure you can pursue your education without hindrance. By alleviating financial stress, you'll be better able to focus on your studies and work towards your aspirations in clinical psychology.

Your dedication to making mental health services accessible to your community reflects a deep sense of compassion and empathy. Your future clinic has the potential to positively impact countless lives, and your determination to offer affordable services is truly commendable. <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Thank you very much  Ms Aditi .
22/2/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 759 9952: No , can u highlight them .
22/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/2/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/2/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Clearly understand.
22/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Nice to connect with you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi .
22/2/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 759 9952: Yes sounds really exciting, can't wait for the Wednesday Wisdom. Everything is really clear and understandable.
22/2/24, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
5/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Clearly noted
5/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Noted as well
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*RUTENDO/ADITI*
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
5/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Everything is understood

5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The current session has come to an end. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time for our next session. Please ensure that you're punctual. ⌛
6/3/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!☀️
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?🚀
6/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Good afternoon how are you

Yes um ready for today's session
6/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking!
Okay, great!
6/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
6/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
6/3/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/3/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Noted
11/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: From now on all our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line from *8:00 AM onwards*
11/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/3/24, 1:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

11/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Taken note of
11/3/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
11/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 759 9952: Will definitely do that with pleasure.  Thank you very much
11/3/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Rutendo, that concludes our initial orientation.

Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
