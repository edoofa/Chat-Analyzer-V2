I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. As I have been reading that there have been *reports of a potential cholera outbreak in the Zambia region recently*, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.

We are well. Still in New Delhi recovering after surgery.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 12:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.
