11/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks. I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly your desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.

11/3/24, 2:12 PM - +260 97 4333579: It's my mom
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - +260 97 4333579: So like how old are you

11/3/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thabo, I am 25, may I know why you are asking?
11/3/24, 2:19 PM - +260 97 4333579: There's no reason like really I'm just asking
11/3/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
11/3/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Thabo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/3/24, 2:28 PM - +260 97 4333579: My long term goals are simply really. They all revolve around one thing which is making my family proud. It's all about my attaining stability, me finding my footing five years from now. And knowing that I can acquire the social security that comes along with me being independent. And last but not least in the long term run I see myself being able to give back to the society as they say it takes a community to raise a child
11/3/24, 2:30 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's clear that your long-term goals are deeply rooted in values of family, stability, and community. Striving to make your family proud and attaining stability speaks volumes about your dedication and sense of responsibility. Achieving independence and social security is a significant milestone, and I applaud your determination to reach that point within the next five years. Moreover, your desire to give back to society highlights your compassion and commitment to making a positive impact beyond yourself. Remember, each step you take toward your goals brings you closer to realizing your vision. Keep pursuing your aspirations with passion and perseverance, and I have no doubt you'll make your dreams a reality while uplifting those around you.
11/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it for today. So we will resume our session in your allotted time slot.
I am happy we have come this forward and I am extremely thrilled to take this journey ahead with you.

12/3/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
12/3/24, 2:38 PM - +260 97 4333579: Yes sorry for the delay
12/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @260974333579 May I know why you are late for the session?
12/3/24, 2:50 PM - +260 97 4333579: I got caught up with youth day celebrations
12/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand, please ensure that you inform me beforehand in such a case.
12/3/24, 2:51 PM - +260 97 4333579: Okay thank you for understanding
12/3/24, 2:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/3/24, 2:55 PM - +260 97 4333579: No
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/3/24, 2:59 PM - +260 97 4333579: Okay
12/3/24, 3:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - +260 97 4333579: Okay
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session, it was amazing. Looking forward to our session tomorrow!
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - +260 97 4333579: Thank you
