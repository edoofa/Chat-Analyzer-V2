I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
11/3/24, 1:57 PM - +267 72 178 074: Afternoon ma'am...we are doing well
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's great!
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - +267 72 178 074: I am ready and inspired
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
11/3/24, 2:14 PM - +267 72 178 074: Those are my parents .
11/3/24, 2:14 PM - +267 75 009 589: Good afternoon. I am Mable Majere. Blessing's mother. Teacher by profession

11/3/24, 2:15 PM - +267 75 009 589: Likewise. Thank you
11/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Blessing, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/3/24, 2:16 PM - +267 74 495 656: Good afternoon. I am Cephas Madhinga .Blessing's father
11/3/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to connect with you as well and I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey of Blessing!
11/3/24, 2:20 PM - +267 72 178 074: My longterm goals are to be a doctor and offer some medical contribution to my community and uplift it. I believe  the EWYL program will assist me in covering some of the tuition fees that will make the first step to my goal easier as I will be able to focus more on completing the diploma and degree without worry much on fees.
11/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a commendable long-term goal! Becoming a doctor and contributing to your community's medical needs is incredibly noble. It's wonderful that you see the EWYL program as a valuable resource to help alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with pursuing your education. With the assistance of the program, you'll be able to concentrate more on your studies and dedicate yourself fully to achieving your diploma and degree. Keep your determination strong, and I'm confident you'll make significant strides toward realizing your aspirations.
11/3/24, 2:24 PM - +267 72 178 074: Thank you
11/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/3/24, 2:36 PM - +267 72 178 074: I think so
11/3/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, can you brief them for me?
11/3/24, 2:38 PM - +267 72 178 074: Make sure education is affordable and accessible to all
11/3/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/3/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/3/24, 2:40 PM - +267 72 178 074: Understood
11/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it for today. So we will resume our session in your allotted time slot.
I am happy we have come this forward and I am extremely thrilled to take this journey ahead with you.
11/3/24, 2:42 PM - +267 72 178 074: Okay ma'am ...thank you very much
12/3/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
12/3/24, 2:04 PM - +267 72 178 074: Afternoon ma'am
12/3/24, 2:04 PM - +267 72 178 074: Yes
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/3/24, 2:12 PM - +267 72 178 074: Understood
12/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/3/24, 2:16 PM - +267 72 178 074: Yea
12/3/24, 2:16 PM - +267 72 178 074: Yes*
12/3/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

12/3/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - +267 72 178 074: I have read
12/3/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/3/24, 2:38 PM - +267 72 178 074: Yes
12/3/24, 2:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/3/24, 2:55 PM - +267 72 178 074: Perfect
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session, it was amazing. Looking forward to our session tomorrow!
12/3/24, 3:23 PM - +267 72 178 074: Yes
12/3/24, 3:25 PM - +267 72 178 074: Okay. Have a great evening
