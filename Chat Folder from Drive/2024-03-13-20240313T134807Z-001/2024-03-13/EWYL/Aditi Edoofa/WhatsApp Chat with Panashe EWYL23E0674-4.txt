6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Panashe

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 323 8283: Oky sure thank you Ms.Aditi
11/1/24, 4:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

Well, as your mentor I truly appreciate your commitment and effort to attend the event. We understand that travel logistics can sometimes be challenging, and we want to make attending our event as convenient as possible for you but making travel arrangements at such a scale is not possible for us. So, you would be required to make your travel arrangements by yourself. 

However, I want to emphasize that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment toward your future education. Our founders, who have traveled all the way from India, covering a distance of over 5000 miles, are coming specifically to meet you and share insights about your higher education and numerous opportunities.

So, as your mentor, I would strongly suggest that you make the necessary arrangements and attend the event as it’s going to be a life-changing experience for you.
