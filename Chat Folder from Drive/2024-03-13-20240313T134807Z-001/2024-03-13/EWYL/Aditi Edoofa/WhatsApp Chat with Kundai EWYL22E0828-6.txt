So are you ready for today's session?
26/12/23, 11:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263737734295 Over the past few weeks, I've noticed that network challenges may be limiting your ability to participate in our sessions. However, for quite some time now, I've observed that our progress in these sessions has been stagnant due to your unavailability. Could you please clarify if there are any factors beyond network issues that are hindering your attendance in these sessions?

29/12/23, 8:28 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Kundai!
Hope you are well.

 I've noticed it's been quite a while since you've been able to attend the sessions. I understand that you are facing challenges with your network, and I want you to know that we've been working hard to finalize our project discussions for you to self-finance your education.
This is coming from a place of genuine interest and since you have not been able to attend your sessions for a few weeks now so according to the academic board of Edoofa I am supposed to put your journey on hold.
Also, I am giving you a second option as I'm genuinely interested in finding a solution here. What do you think we should do to resolve this? Let's work together to ensure you can fully participate and benefit from our ongoing efforts.
29/12/23, 11:32 AM - +263 73 773 4295: Good day ma'am, l suggest that we can resolve it by doing our sessions in between the day , as long as my network is working
29/12/23, 11:38 AM - +263 73 773 4295: Maam at this moment it has a better connection may we can continue
29/12/23, 1:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I have suggested that time to you as well, that I have another session from 2 PM to 3 PM, but you did not show up then as well.
29/12/23, 1:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
