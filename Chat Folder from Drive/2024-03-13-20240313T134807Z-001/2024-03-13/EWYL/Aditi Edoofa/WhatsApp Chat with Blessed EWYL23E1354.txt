Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.

11/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

12/3/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Blessed, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Okay,
My long terms goals are like this,
I want to be a successful electrical engineer in the future. I want to be able to serve in different Electrical companies including the one in my home country Zimbabwe.

I think the EWYL Program will help me achieve these goals by making the payment of my fees easy to my parents hence I'll be able to continue with my studies in India, gaining skills and become a very successful Electrical engineer. EWYL will also give me exposure to different business men and women so as to interact with them and also gaining the necessary skills
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an excellent set of long-term goals you've outlined! Your ambition to become a successful electrical engineer and contribute to companies, including those in your home country, is admirable. The EWYL Program indeed seems like a valuable opportunity that can greatly support your aspirations. By easing the financial burden of your education, it allows you to focus wholeheartedly on your studies and skill development. Moreover, the exposure to diverse professionals through the program will provide you with invaluable networking opportunities and insights into the business world, further enhancing your journey towards success. Keep pursuing your goals with determination and enthusiasm, and I'm confident you'll achieve great things in your career as an electrical engineer.
12/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Thank you ma'am
12/3/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 126 1024: No, may you share them with me please
12/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/3/24, 2:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Well understood ma'am. I really appreciate it
12/3/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Thanks again ma'am, it's a pleasure to get to know them.
12/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure!
12/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Sure ma'am, very interesting
12/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

12/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Well I have gone through the newsletters ma'am
12/3/24, 2:48 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Yes it is
12/3/24, 2:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Sounds awesome ma'am.
12/3/24, 2:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
12/3/24, 2:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding today's session, it was amazing. Looking forward to our session tomorrow!
12/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Yes it is clear
12/3/24, 3:03 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Well appreciated ma'am
