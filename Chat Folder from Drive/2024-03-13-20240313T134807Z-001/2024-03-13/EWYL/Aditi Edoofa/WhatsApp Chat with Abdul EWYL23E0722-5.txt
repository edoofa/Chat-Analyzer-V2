6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Abdul!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 039 4189: Oky thank you ma'am

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

21/2/24, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Abdul!
Hope you are well.

Wow! Great. Looks like you had a great time, I look forward to your response to my above message!
21/2/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 039 4189: As for the Meet and Greet '24 function as for me it was a wonderful event . I thought that I won't meet Mr Angand but will meet the  other team but surprisingly I saw him and I couldn't believe that I finally saw him with my eye despite being him in pictures . 

On this day I was proud that I met my other Edoofian family and got some friends. 
What surprised me the most is the number of people who were there and the event , in my mind I thought that maybe they will be few people but never the less the hall was very full to an extent that other proud Edoofian where sitting outside the hall ..

During the session Mr Angand played us two videos of the other Edoofian at they Slice CON 24  sharing with us their inspirations and experience during this event and how they meet up with other entrepreneurs including Mr Bajaj and others .  

After watching this video I was overwhelmed and I imagined me being there sharing my inspirations and desires .

Ma'am I don't wanna lie to you after watching those video I felt like it's already late for me to go . I want to gooooooo I want to come to India .. 

Here at my home town many people would say this is a lie and you don't have to believe this but after I watch the video and meeting with the Team Edoofa and I said to myself I am blessed and Edoofa is a family to me . 

After the session with Mr Angand . The time for the ESAT exam came and it went well . I wrote my Commercial Exam it was out of 100. I just hope I passed...

After this Meet and Greet '24  I saw myself accomplishing my goals and my dreams with having Edoofa as my Family .
  And I would like to thank you Ms Aditi for being my Mentor and being there for me all the time . 
This was the most interesting day of my life . The other thing that was funny and enjoyable moment was that time when Mr Angand captures a video Asking everyone *"Who are were????"* And everyone shouts *"We are proud Edoofians!!!!!!"* 

I enjoyed this .

I would like to have more similar events like this while being with the family at all.

For the improvements ,as for me the day went well and it was quite good and memorable . I want it to be more fun and more enjoyable than this event . 

One of my main wish was to meet  My mentor Ms Aditi but unfortunately you didn't come 😭😭 but I would like to see you
