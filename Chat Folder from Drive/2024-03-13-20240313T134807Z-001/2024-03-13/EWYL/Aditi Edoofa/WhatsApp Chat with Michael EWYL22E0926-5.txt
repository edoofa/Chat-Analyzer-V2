I hope this message finds you well. I trust you had a wonderful Christmas holiday!🎅🏻

I wanted to reach out and let you know that as you know that your session on Monday was missed due to the festivities🎄
To ensure we don't miss out on our sessions and updates, let's *schedule a session tomorrow from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.*
Make sure that *follow the PROUD EDOOFIAN ritual* and are on time for the session🕰️
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

(August 2024 or August 2025)
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - +263 78 015 2306: Will do much appreciated
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝 <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days.

8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*Edoofa Scholarship Program*
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/3/24, 4:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
