I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
11/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Hello Ms. Aditi nice to meet you. Am glad to have the chance to be one of your pupils
11/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.
11/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 935 8444: glad to you hear that
11/3/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
11/3/24, 1:45 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Thank you very much for the video it is really inspiring, infect am already inspired
11/3/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for the kind words!
11/3/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
11/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay there are my parents both mother and father. But for now my father won't be available to talk though my mother is here.
11/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Good day Aditi. Glad to meet you
11/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 289 8718: I am Bukhosi's mother
11/3/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good day ma'am! 
I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Bukhosi will learn a lot from this journey to success.
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Surely, thus my prayer
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Bukhosi, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay. So for my long term goal is I want to be a microbiologist. I believe EWYL program will help me in achieving it, in that it will support me financially as I study hard to achieve my goal
11/3/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That sounds like a fantastic long-term goal! Becoming a microbiologist is both challenging and rewarding. It's great to hear that you see the EWYL program as a means to support you financially on your journey toward achieving this goal. With dedication and hard work, I have no doubt that you'll make significant strides toward your aspirations. Keep focusing on your studies and pushing forward toward your dreams
11/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Thank you very much for your kind words.
11/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Hopefully he  will work hard, because there is no-one who will do it on his behalfg
11/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Behalf
11/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! I agree.
11/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 935 8444: no I don't
11/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Okay thank you very much for making me understand all this
11/3/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
11/3/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay noted
11/3/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Following
11/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yah very interesting
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

11/3/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
11/3/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yah it is the one which captured my attention a lot in the rest of the news letter. Yah it would be really wonderful to be mentioned by the founder.
11/3/24, 2:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
11/3/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 935 8444: That sounds great especially the 3rd goal am really looking forward to it
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay
11/3/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything!
11/3/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it for today. So we will resume our session in your allotted time slot.
I am happy we have come this forward and I am extremely thrilled to take this journey ahead with you.
11/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 289 8718: OK thus fine
11/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay from this document what I understood is that you help us students not only to learn skills but also to earn for learning. The earning here you defined it as scholarship credits, industrial exposure, an experience that prepares one for life after university and the skills to Excel during that period.
11/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay I want to understand here. When you say my allotted time slot you mean for which day ?
12/3/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for the session?🚀
12/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Afternoon how are you

yes am ready we may start
12/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Good day
12/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking!
12/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
12/3/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So teh time for our sessions is from *2:00 PM to 3:00 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
12/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay noted
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Additionally, I want to inform you that at present, the first project is on hold owing to the substantial number of projects and commitments we are currently managing. We are prioritizing our efforts to ensure the successful completion of existing tasks before resuming work on this project. Till that time you may focus on the projects that I am going to explain.
12/3/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay noted
12/3/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
12/3/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay it's clear
12/3/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
12/3/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay what I learnt from this audio is start in this community building project you require a student to interact with their close friends, relatives or any close to them in Africa. In this interaction a student will share insight to his fellow friends about the Edoofa program. If that friend is interested in it he or she will contact you guys Edoofa and as they do so they should tell you how and through who did they come to know about Edoofa. So that fellow African will then say it's me with that a certain amount which is $5 will be put to the scholarship credit. Now if that fellow African seems to be more interested in the program and continues to pay the first half of the money it will be $20 for the scholarship credit and if they proceed and complete it will be $30
12/3/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

12/3/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 935 8444: noted
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM*
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 289 8718: OK go ahead
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

12/3/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/3/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/3/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

12/3/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay what I understood here is that the student must reach out to his school and any from local area. The student will then have to contact the headmaster of the school share info on how he came to learn about Edoofa program. Now then after this the student will organize a meeting of the headmaster and Edoofa program director through maybe Google meet and after that the student will share the contacts of the heads with Edoofa
12/3/24, 2:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic!
12/3/24, 2:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap the project

 As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

12/3/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay thank you very much for your time.
12/3/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Hello. In as much a s l appreciate all the projects offered by Edoofa.  May you kindly clarify on how the student will handle the expenses of visiting schools and Headmasters explaining about Edoofa.  Considering that here in Zimbabwe schools are a distance apart
12/3/24, 3:12 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Certainly, while I appreciate the opportunities provided by Edoofa, it's essential to clarify that students will need to bear the expenses of visiting schools and meeting with headmasters on their own. However, with determination and resourcefulness, students can find ways to manage these costs, perhaps by budgeting carefully or seeking support from family and local communities.
12/3/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Ok
