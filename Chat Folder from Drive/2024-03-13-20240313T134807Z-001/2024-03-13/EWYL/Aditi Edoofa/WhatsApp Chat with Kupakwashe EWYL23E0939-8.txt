6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Kupakwashe

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
8/1/24, 7:55 AM - +263 78 008 5885: That's nice
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

23/1/24, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
24/1/24, 7:30 AM - +263 78 008 5885: Well noted maam.

*Are you tired of connecting with us only through screens?*
Well, now is the time! Guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – just like last year, this month, we're planning an annual and exclusive meet & greet in Africa! 🌍 However, this time it’s different! It’s a mega event that has never happened in the history of Zimbabwe, as we are expecting a crowd of 5000 people! Surprising, isn't it?🤩

Now, we understand that you and your parents must have a lot of questions in your mind as you are in the middle of your University admission process. Therefore, keeping this in mind, along with Mr. Angad, our admissions team, and our counselors will be there as well to address all of your concerns!🚀
1/2/24, 4:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, bring your parents along, and don't miss your chance to expedite your admission process. Not only that, get ready to dive into the opportunities you are going to experience when you are here in India, as Mr. Angad himself is going to walk you through the journey of being an Edoofian. After all, only 6 months are left! So, get ready for this epic adventure, and I'll share the details with you super soon! ⚡

*By the way, we'd like to reserve your seats in advance. Could you please let us know how many people you'll be coming with? This will help us allocate the right number of slots for you.*
7/2/24, 11:22 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Kupakwashe!

I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I was looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

Is everything alright? Are you facing any challenges? Is there something you'd like to share?
8/2/24, 12:09 AM - +263 78 008 5885: I'm still working on it...l will inform you about it.
