7/2/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
7/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam I wish to acquire my degrees abroad also I want to be employed while I am in varsity so that I can manage to pay for my higher education for the last semesters

7/2/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's a commendable goal! Pursuing your degrees abroad can offer invaluable experiences and perspectives. Additionally, seeking employment while studying is a proactive approach to managing your finances and gaining practical skills. It's essential to plan strategically and stay focused on your academic and professional objectives. With dedication and perseverance, you can achieve your aspirations and excel in both your studies and career endeavors.
7/2/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Thus I'm hoping that the EWYL will help me in achieving all these goals

7/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
7/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Please shed more light
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
7/2/24, 9:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

8/2/24, 8:30 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Good morning Maam
8/2/24, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning on this beautiful day!☀️
I trust you're doing well.

Are you prepared for the session?🚀
8/2/24, 8:39 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Yes Maam we are fully prepared for the session just that the network connection here is very poor so please bare with us
8/2/24, 8:41 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
8/2/24, 8:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/2/24, 8:46 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Noted
8/2/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/2/24, 9:06 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Very interesting
8/2/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

8/2/24, 9:26 AM - +27 83 434 2213: Indeed it is great
8/2/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
8/2/24, 9:29 AM - +27 83 434 2213: It sounds very interesting
8/2/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation.

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

22/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam let me brief you on the EWYL team I have. 
There is Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the Department . 

We also have Ms  Davi, who is the Head coach and she mentors us through her content and structured curriculum .

2 My mentor Ms Aditi Kapoor has set some goals for my EWYL journey to be a success thus I noted the following : 
1. To make sure that my academic journey is great
2. To ensure that I am  given enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education there in India!
3. She also emphasised on, working towards attaining the objective - that I am  learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare myself for the real-world workplace and help me grow holistically

3. Mr. Angad Singh the founder of Edoofa interact with us students via Newsletters

4. The Hall of Inspiration according to what I caught from Mr. Angad Singh it is that no one is never immature or young to make decisions for example the was this student Nkosilomusa Jecheche I caught a lot from him as he highlighted that leading religious groups helps you become a good leader and a good citizen. So for one to be a good leader he or she must promote change in his or her society not to fight change In brief I caught that Edoofa hall of Inspiration helps one to becone a good leader and someone who is valuable in the long run in the community

29/2/24, 1:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam after going through the document I can briefly say that Edoofa EWYL program triea by all means to prepare students for whatever the future with holds for them infact it tries to make higher education accessible, affordable and makes one employable...

The EWYL program identified two reasons that we need to know that is awareness and acquiring skills that will allow us to be employable in the future. Awareness factor states that  we should be kept up to date about what the future has for us and we should try by all means to prepare for it thus Edoofa work with companies in order to help the students gain skills from the industrial experts thus making them employable

Also the EWYL program allows for schoolarship credits to be earned thus also reducing the burden on parents and promoting the goal of self financing higher education from students
29/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
29/2/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/2/24, 2:18 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok Maam to start with, Coporate alliances have its main objective that is ensuring the gaining of an understanding of the market one wishes to venture into in the future. It offers a great opportunity to connect with great companies in my society. Also they emphasised that in order to connect with the companies we may make us of neighbours, parents who work in these companies.
Also I caught that in order to work on these, we may open an account which allows to search for companies.
Lastly creating that account will enhance my credibility and increase the scope of finding job opportunities in the world infact it allow one to explore the job opportunities available
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

1/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 081 5279: After reading the document I came to understand how helps us to approach different companies in the world as this was clearly explained to students through a series of step ranging from searching that is step one to step 6 which emphasis on reaching out to these whom you've been through their background with the company.

So I caught that in order for one to choose or connect with the right Companies, there are certain factors that must be taken into consideration. These factors were inclusive of the nature of the company, scale of company, financial stability and lastly dwell much on the background of the founder.
With the above included in one's research I can guarantee that it will indeed be a successful one
1/3/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in reply as I was facing some network challenges.
1/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Understood Maam

6/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share an audio file from our mentorship team and you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
6/3/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Noted Maam
6/3/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Ok to begin with,  Community building as it was said that it refers to a process of establishing and strengthening the relationships and shared identity among individuals in a particular group or community. Its goal is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promote social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and honourship towards achieving collective success. For it to be a success students are there advised to reach out to African students who have gratuated or completed their second year education or those who are currently in the final year
The Mentor said that she is anticipating students use a networking system to look for students to help the organisation grow. 
Through out this project the Edoofa team tries to ensure that the students earn scholarship credits that is ensured through provision of guidance and support from the team
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
6/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 081 5279: Noted
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*GREAT/ADITI*
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *ADD MENTOR:*

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I understand your challenges, it's okay let's try to make the most of the time left.
8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/3/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
11/3/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
11/3/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

11/3/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - +27 83 434 2213: OK Maam let me revisit yhe chats
11/3/24, 2:13 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
11/3/24, 2:20 PM - +27 83 434 2213: Everything is on point Maam we may continue
11/3/24, 2:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

11/3/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great, this concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress toward achieving great success. And I will share the new schedule shortly for your sessions, all the best for your projects
11/3/24, 2:39 PM - +27 83 434 2213: Thank you Maam
