6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Kooji
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - +260 97 8023486: Thank you very much for sharing
11/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Kooji 
I hope you are doing well

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.

11/1/24, 7:16 PM - +260 97 8023486: Thank you for sharing this, it really encourages me to see so many young people making big steps in their education and has encouraged me to keep going and pushing myself to do the best I can so one day I can be there as well. It also makes me excited about my up coming trip to India with so many things to learn and do. Once again I say thank you.
12/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that the experiences shared have been encouraging for you.

27/1/24, 8:18 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Kooji*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:24 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 9:45 AM - +260 97 8023486: Good Morning Ms.Sharda,  it fills me with sadness hearing that you will longer be my mentor. Through out my Edoofian journey you have been there to help and guide me every step of the way. Even though we are parting ways, you will always be in heart and mind. Thank you for all that you have done for me, I truly appreciate it. And as you go on I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.
~Thank You
5/2/24, 9:18 AM - +260 97 8023486: Good morning, I hope all are keeping up well. Since the time Ms. Sharda went to higher education and stepped back from being my mentor, the indication was that the mentorship team will reach out to me to discuss the upcoming plan for the new mentor. It is now one week two days  , I have had no communication from the mentorship team on the way forward. May I be guided on the way forward. 
I submit.
5/2/24, 9:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, Kooji, this is Ms Tushti. I have taken over Ms Sharda's account for the time being, while the Academic Board is looking for a suitable mentor for you. While a new mentor is assigned to you, kindly feel free to reach out to me here on this group with your questions and queries. You may also share your progress with the projects you have undertaken here.
5/2/24, 9:30 AM - +260 97 8023486: Thank you very much  Ms Tushti for the message and update. On the community project, the response slowly coming as I have received a few applications. I will share one which I have received on this group. Thank you.

I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. As I have been reading that there have been reports of a potential cholera outbreak in Zambia region recently, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.
10/2/24, 12:32 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kooji! 🌞

I hope you're doing well. Our team is hard at work preparing for the upcoming event in Zimbabwe, but we know that learning never stops. To support your ongoing education, here's an interesting article for you💡

10/2/24, 3:14 PM - +260 97 8023486: Starting a business is not as easy as most people thing it is. Without a proper plan it is unlikely to succeed because there are many factors to look at such as competition, target, type of products and services, location,  swot analysis and many others . Its not enough to stop there, it need a good plan, organisation, and structure to turn an idea into reality. And the secret to achieving this is consistency and discipline.
12/2/24, 7:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning, Kooji!
Absolutely, I completely agree. Starting a business is indeed a complex endeavor that requires careful planning, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of various factors such as competition, target market, product or service offerings, location, SWOT analysis, and more. Without a solid plan, organization, and structure, it's challenging for a business to succeed in today's competitive landscape. Consistency and discipline are indeed key elements in turning an idea into a successful business reality.
22/2/24, 3:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Kooji!
Hope you are well.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 3:56 PM - Sharda Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.
