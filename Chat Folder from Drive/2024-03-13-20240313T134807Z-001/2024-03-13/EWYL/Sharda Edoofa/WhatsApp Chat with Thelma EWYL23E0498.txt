27/1/24, 8:32 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Thelma*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:33 AM - +260 777913821: That nice for u
27/1/24, 8:35 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
7/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Thelma,
I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. As I have been reading that there have been reports of a potential cholera outbreak in Zambia region recently, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.
22/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Thelma!
Hope you are well.

I'm happy to share that our team just got back from an incredible event in Zimbabwe, and let me tell you, this time our Meet & Greet event was bigger and better! It was an amazing three-day event! 🎉

This time, it wasn't just Mr. Angad who went, but our whole admissions team, counseling team, and the program director joined in too!

Students and parents alike had the exclusive opportunity to dive deep into the exciting journey that awaits them in India. And guess what? Mr. Angad himself talked about exciting employment opportunities for everyone in India along with the EWYL plan. We also organized a special scholarship test for students who aren't part of the Edoofian community yet.
22/2/24, 3:52 PM - Sharda Edoofa: I've got some photos to share with you. Get ready for a sneak peek into the excitement and energy of the event!

Also, we're planning to bring the excitement to Zambia too! So, get ready to embark on a journey filled with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities.
