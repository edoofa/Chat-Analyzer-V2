27/1/24, 8:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻

I hope this message finds you and your family in good health and spirits. *As I have been reading that there have been reports of a potential cholera outbreak in Zambia region recently, so I wanted to reach out to make sure that you and your loved ones are safe and doing well*.🩵

As our regular sessions are currently on hold, I wanted to take this opportunity to connect with you personally and express my concern.

12/3/24, 8:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Prince, I really hope that you are well. As you may know that your previous mentor Ms. Saloni has decided to opt  for her higher education, Hence here I am Mr. Rishabh your new mentor from now onwards.
12/3/24, 8:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While I was going through your previous conversations with Ms. Saloni, I read that you were preparing for your examination and was not available because of your hectic schedule back then. I am very curious to know about how your exams went and if you are now available for the resuming the EWYL program.
12/3/24, 8:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I just wanted you to know that the EWYL program is very beneficial for the students as one can benefit themselves by learning tremendous skills which are very important if one wants to survive in today’s modern world. You can also earn enough credits if you work hard which can waive off your whole one year university fees. So please take this opportunity seriously. I really don't want you to miss this!
