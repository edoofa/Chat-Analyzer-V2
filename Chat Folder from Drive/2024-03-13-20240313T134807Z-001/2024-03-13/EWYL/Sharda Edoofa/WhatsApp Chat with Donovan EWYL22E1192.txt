I have been expecting to hear from you for the past couple of days, but I can see you have not been able to get back to me due to certain reasons I am not aware of. You see, I had really been looking forward to having you at the event as I know how beneficial it is going to be for you. Most of my students have already quite enthusiastically reserved seats for themselves and their family and friends.

12/3/24, 7:49 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While I was going through your previous conversations with Ms. Jasmine, I read that you have decided to defer your academic session of this year to next year. I know that it’s a very difficult to decide about what you want to study or where you want to, as I myself has gone through the same once.
12/3/24, 7:50 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hence, I am here to tell you that if you are considering coming to India this year, Now is the best time to start with EWYL program as if we start working hard together from now, we can learn many skills that can help you before and after you arrive in India and also we can earn as many credits as we can so that your parents don't have to stress about the funds.
