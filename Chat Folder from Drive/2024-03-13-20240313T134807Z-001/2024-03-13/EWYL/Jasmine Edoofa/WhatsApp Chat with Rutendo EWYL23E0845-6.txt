28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 3:19 PM - +263 77 956 9902: Tne best way to execute Project 2 is to create a WhatsApp group consisting of students who are either in form 6 or have executed their form 6 already and to reach out in numbers you add a lot of your schoolmates in the form six or who have finished. Once they have joined the group i then select suitable students and in the group i send information about edoofa persuading them on why the program is most profitable to them and can help them gain international education
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now it's time to wrap up the session. Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm

Do you remember?
2/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 956 9902: Yes i remember
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 12:30 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with you.

- As per the invitation, *you* are supposed to attend the event along with your parents on *19th of February* which is Monday.
 
- If you are recommending any of *your friends (Non Edoofians)* along with their parents to attend the event, as per their choice, the seminar is scheduled for *18th of February (8am/1pm) or 19th February(1pm)*. They should carry a physical copy of their admit cards to enter the event.
17/2/24, 8:34 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please ensure that you are present at the venue 30 minutes earlier and are dressed appropriately.
Don't forget to carry your admit card!

I would like to thank you for the opportunity that you gave me to attend this event. It was very educational and I learnt a lot about what my future would hold if I go along with this program. It was very heart warming to see a lot of other students in the hall yesterday and now I know that I'm not alone and more than blessed to be this much along the way. Many more programs like should definitely come along in the near future and a syllabus for the exams too but however all in all, I really enjoyed and have trust you as edoofa care for Africa and we, the students will have a bright future with you as our mentors

I want to extend our sincere appreciation for your patience and understanding during the recent Team Edoofa Africa Visit '24.

The overwhelming response we've received from all over Zimbabwe has been truly inspiring. Due to the influx of inquiries and applications, the mentorship team has been working tirelessly to accommodate everyone's needs.

In light of the ongoing changes, we've had to restructure the session schedule multiple times in an effort to find a suitable timing for all participants. I am herewith attaching the final timetable that you must follow. We kindly request your adherence to this schedule moving forward.

Your active participation in the upcoming sessions is highly anticipated, and we look forward to your continued engagement.
