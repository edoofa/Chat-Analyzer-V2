It is a pleasure to know you!
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:


The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.


Did you understand the goals, Panashe?
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 465 2698: Yes sir. I really understood the two goals. You can go ahead
6/3/24, 2:44 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great, now, apart from these, I have also set three goals for myself for your EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Panashe?
6/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 465 2698: Well, I'm in a jovial mood to share my feelings towards your goals.

This sounds great and I'm forever grateful
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Glad to hear that Panashe!
6/3/24, 2:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would now like to share an overview of our program structure with you. After our in-depth project discussions (which we shall have right now),I will share the schedule of our . On Wednesdays, I'll introduce "Wednesday Wisdom" covering a skill set, followed by a weekend activity to apply what you've learned. Deadlines will be shared with the lesson and activity.

Exciting, right?

Additionally, our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, connects with Edoofians through weekly newsletters. These provide valuable insights, experiences, and wisdom. You'll receive an email with a PDF every weekend. Reading these consistently is a great chance to learn from the best. I'll share a few previous newsletters for a quick read. Let me know your thoughts!

12/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 465 2698: Well, EWYL provides higher education that is accessible, affordable and makes one being employable.

Two things are being bet under Earn While You Learn program and these are awareness and aqquiring skills.
The skills are online or digital skills

There are three Projects under Edoofa EWYL program document you have shared. The projects are as follows

Project 1-Corporate Alliances,

Project 2-Community Building and

Project 3- African Schools Reform Mission.

 *Under Project 1(Corporate Alliances)*

On Primary Outcome, Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers.

Skillset covered, that is networking skills using professional networking websites like Google sheets

Mindset covered, focus on reaching out to people who are infuential.

 *The Project 2(Community Building)*

Community Building is a field of processes directed towards the creation of community among individuals within a regional area with a common interests

Under Primary Outcome, students reach their personal and extended networks and offer the opportunities to be part of Edoofa

Skillset covered are permission skills as well as love raging social media.

 *Project 3(African Schools Education Reform Mission)*

*This comprises of listing higher secondary schools in your area
*Your school should be in the first
*People at that school can be identified through personal network.

-On every successful call by the school to team Edoofa.$2 is credited to one's balance
-Once the group process begins,an award of $10 is recieved to scholarship credits
-Additional of $25 when five students completes enrollment from a perticular school.

That is what conclude my understanding on the EWYL project.
12/3/24, 2:40 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Perfect Panashe! I am really impressed seeing this elaborate understand of yours!
12/3/24, 2:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *I think we’re ready to move to the community building project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite!
