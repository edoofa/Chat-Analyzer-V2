While we were having multiple conversations with our students in the past few days for the meet & greet event, we figured that there is a slight confusion in the invitation dates. Hence, I wanted to quickly reach out and ensure that the same is not the case with yo*.

Good afternoon
6/3/24, 2:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Perfect Anotidaishe!
6/3/24, 3:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:


The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.


Did you understand the goals, Anotidaishe?
6/3/24, 3:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I was hoping a response. However, as the session time for today is over let us connect back tomorrow at the same time to take our discussion forward! Have a great day ahead!
6/3/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Yeah it's clear and l have understood the goals of EWYL.
7/3/24, 2:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning student,
As I am feeling unwell today, I won't be able to take your today's session. I hope you would understand and please make sure you join in for the session on time!
7/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Okay 
I wish you  a quick recovery sir
8/3/24, 8:29 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning student,
As I am still unwell, so I would not be able to take your session for today as well. I hope you would understand. Let us connect back tomorrow for a fruitful session!
8/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 820 8282: It's Okay sir we will connect tomorrow for a fruitful session. 
Wishing you a speedy recovery.
11/3/24, 2:05 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Anotidaishe!
Are you ready for today's session?
11/3/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 583 4033: Good afternoon sir
Sorry for the delay l am ready for the session.
11/3/24, 2:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Anotidaishe,
You joined the session when it is supposed to end. Could you please share the challenges you faced? <This message was edited>

11/3/24, 3:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I understand your challenge Anotidaishe! However, please make sure you make the necessary arrangements and join the session on time tomorrow.

Are you ready for the session?
12/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Yeah sir l am ready for the session
12/3/24, 2:37 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Perfect! Now let us start from where we left our discussion!
12/3/24, 2:37 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I have also set three goals for myself for your EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Anotidaishe?
12/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 820 8282: That's sounds good sir.
It's motivating to have a good mentor.
12/3/24, 2:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: It is my pleasure to be your mentor Anotidaishe!
12/3/24, 2:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now I would now like to share an overview of our program structure with you. After our in-depth project discussions (which we shall have right now),I will share the schedule of our . On Wednesdays, I'll introduce "Wednesday Wisdom" covering a skill set, followed by a weekend activity to apply what you've learned. Deadlines will be shared with the lesson and activity.

Exciting, right?

Additionally, our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, connects with Edoofians through weekly newsletters. These provide valuable insights, experiences, and wisdom. You'll receive an email with a PDF every weekend. Reading these consistently is a great chance to learn from the best. I'll share a few previous newsletters for a quick read. Let me know your thoughts!
12/3/24, 2:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 2:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm curious to know which section you found most interesting. Personally, I find it challenging to pick a favourite as each section offers a unique taste and interest.
12/3/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Yeah each section offers a unique taste and interest but for me the 3 quotes are words of wisdom which will motivate one to sacrifice and work very hard to live a life of their dreams.
12/3/24, 3:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Anotidaishe!
12/3/24, 3:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: However, speaking of sections, did you happen to notice the "Edoofa Hall of Inspiration"? It's a noteworthy segment where students get celebrated, and your mention by the founder himself is quite an accomplishment. I'm sure, like many, you might aspire to be featured in this section someday, isn’t it, Anotidaishe?
12/3/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Yes being mentioned by the founder is quite an accomplishment and obviously as an ambitious student l would aspire to be featured in that section someday.
12/3/24, 3:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Glad to hear that we are on the same page Anotidaishe!
12/3/24, 3:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: However, as the session time for today is over let us connect back tomorrow at the same time to take our discussion forward!
12/3/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 820 8282: Thank you for your time sir.
