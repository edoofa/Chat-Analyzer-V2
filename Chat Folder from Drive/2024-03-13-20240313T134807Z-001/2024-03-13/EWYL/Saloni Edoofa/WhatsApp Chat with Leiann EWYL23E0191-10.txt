3. *How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person* 
I got the school head's number through my A level biology teacher. We discussed about what Edoofa is all about inorder for him to have a clear understanding.
4/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Thursday to everyone,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
4/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, I am so proud and happy to see this🥳🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes maam
4/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you very much

4/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes maam l will
4/1/24, 10:16 AM - Saloni Edoofa: What about other Heads?
4/1/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 719 3568: They have read my messages but did not reply
4/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 719 3568: One had promised to take a look at the information and get back to me so I'm still waiting

Yes we may begin with our session
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Then we are ready to move on to an amazing journey👏🏼
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/1/24, 10:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/1/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 719 3568: That is well noted maam
12/1/24, 10:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, do let me know.
12/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Yes l have done it
16/1/24, 10:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Leiann!
How are you?

This week we will be having our session on *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Project updates
Since we don’t have the Saturday activity to be discussed for our session today, I want you to come with any concerns you have to work on the Community Building project and the African School project in our session today. I want us to start accelerating our performance so that we can utilize the time to give our utmost on working on the projects.

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.

23/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 78 517 0287: I changed my number so l have been recommunicating with students as well as school heads.But so far the conversations are going well

23/1/24, 5:05 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: In recent years, Edoofa has come to be synonymous with events and seminars that are conducted on a grand scale, and has attempted to deepen the impact it leaves on the students who choose to be a part of the same.

23/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 78 517 0287: Have a great day as well
24/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 517 0287: Good morning  Ms Saloni. I hope you are doing well . May you please share with me form for the School heads l have just talked to St Oswalds high school head and has agreed to have a meeting with the Edoofa director
27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 7:56 PM - +263 78 517 0287: Awww that is good that you are going to further your education but also sad for me that l am losing my mentor.l will miss you Ms Saloni. 🫠☺️

Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨

meet.google.com/tdt-gxjx-tyg

I wish you good luck ahead. Way to go, my Proud Edoofian!!
31/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 517 0287: Alright maam l will be there
31/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 517 0287: So from the meeting l learnt that we are not just proud Edoofians but rather ambassadors who represent Edoofa.I also learnt that there will be guests who enrolled into Edoofa but failed to actually go to India due to some reasons. I also learnt that we are Edoofa's extended arms in this event since this role is a great opportunity in terms of gaining skills in order to cater for a huge event like the meet and greet session. From the meeting l also learnt teamwork inoder for this event to be a success.l learnt to be someone who should know their strengths when it comes to doing activities in an event.
From the meeting l also learnt strong research skills so that we can get the wanted event.
I also learnt that from this event coordinating role l will be granted the opportunity to meet ex Edoofians as well.l also learnt that the event coordinating role is an opportunity to showcase my leadership skills,problem solving abilities and creativity.

So for the roles of an event coordinator l learnt that an event coordinator has the following roles:

1.Acts as the extended arm of Edoofa or the Ambassador of Edoofa.

2.Shows people their places to seat in an orderly manner.
3.If there are any papers to be issued it is the duty of the event coordinator. 
4.To be adequtely prepared for any task given me so that the event goes well.


This is what l understood from the Meeting.Thank you
31/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Hello, Proud Edoofian!!
