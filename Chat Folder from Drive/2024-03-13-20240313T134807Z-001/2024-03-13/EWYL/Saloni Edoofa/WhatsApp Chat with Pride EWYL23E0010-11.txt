27/1/24, 8:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
28/1/24, 10:14 PM - +263 71 582 0116: Good even ma'am.  You have been the best mentor any person could ask for and you taking a step back from being my mentor is really heartbreaking,  I come to you with a heavy heart, I face many challenges and others to help my family I had to look for a part-time job promoting my absence from our weekly sessions thereby holding any progress, I barely have time to be online not that I don't want to participate but I'm busy everyday from 0600 to 2100 and when I get back home I will be tired.....I'm kindly asking if you could reconsider on your decision and we work out how we can progress, your help will be appreciated thank you
31/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Student,
I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Jasmine. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While a new mentor has not been assigned just yet, I want to assure you that efforts are actively underway to identify a suitable mentor who aligns with your goals and aspirations.

In the spirit of ensuring that your learning and growth never stop, I am personally taking the initiative to share this Wednesday's lesson with you as I believe it's crucial to maintain the continuity of your education, and I am excited to contribute to your ongoing development.

In the meantime, if you have any immediate questions or concerns or if there's anything specific you'd like assistance with, feel free to reach out to me. We are here to support you every step of the way.
