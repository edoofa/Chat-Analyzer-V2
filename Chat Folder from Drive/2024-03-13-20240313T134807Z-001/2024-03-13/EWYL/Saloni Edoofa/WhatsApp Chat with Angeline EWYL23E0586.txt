I am doing great! Thanks for asking. <This message was edited>

6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Perfect! Let us begin then.
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:


The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.


Did you understand the goals, Angeline?
6/3/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 970 7761: Yes well understood
6/3/24, 3:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Great, now, apart from these, I have also set three goals for myself for your EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Angeline?
6/3/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 970 7761: It sounds helpful and important on my side
6/3/24, 3:15 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would now like to share an overview of our program structure with you. After our in-depth project discussions (which we shall have right now),I will share the schedule of our . On Wednesdays, I'll introduce "Wednesday Wisdom" covering a skill set, followed by a weekend activity to apply what you've learned. Deadlines will be shared with the lesson and activity.

Exciting, right?

Additionally, our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, connects with Edoofians through weekly newsletters. These provide valuable insights, experiences, and wisdom. You'll receive an email with a PDF every weekend. Reading these consistently is a great chance to learn from the best. I'll share a few previous newsletters for a quick read. Let me know your thoughts!
