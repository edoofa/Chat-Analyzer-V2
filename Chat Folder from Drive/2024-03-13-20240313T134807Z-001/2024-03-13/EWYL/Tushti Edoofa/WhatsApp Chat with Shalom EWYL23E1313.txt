8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
8/3/24, 1:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK let me watch it
8/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 525 0679: It is not opening. L don't know why
8/3/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I will share it again with you.
8/3/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me know if you face any issues.
8/3/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 525 0679: It's still not opening. Maybe it's my phone which has problems. L will watch it in my father's phone when he gets back
8/3/24, 2:15 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I understand, no worries. There may be a network issue. Please try again later when the network is more stable. You can try connecting to wifi or a hotspot and watch video later.
8/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK thank you
8/3/24, 2:18 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
8/3/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 525 0679: If l am correct then it is to make me job ready
8/3/24, 2:22 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes this is also right but let me explain it to you.
8/3/24, 2:22 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
8/3/24, 2:23 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
8/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 525 0679: I understand
8/3/24, 2:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
8/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Noted
8/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
8/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Yes very interesting
8/3/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
8/3/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 525 0679: I am done reading
8/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 525 0679: They are very intriguing. Please continue
8/3/24, 2:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
8/3/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 525 0679: I like the part when a girl named Valerie was talking about her experience. She talked about how she faced discrimination from her peers simply because she is African and how she was able to assert herself to standout despite all that
8/3/24, 3:05 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes  the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_
8/3/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 525 0679: She is somehow inspiring because to be honest discrimination is one of my fears..
8/3/24, 3:05 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
8/3/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Yes it's a very great achievement also
8/3/24, 3:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
8/3/24, 3:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
8/3/24, 3:16 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Alright Shalom. As our session comes to an end, remember: "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt

Keep dreaming big, stay focused, and make every moment count.
8/3/24, 3:30 PM - Tushti Edoofa: First off I would like to assure you that there is no discrimination here in India, many students have come to India for their higher education through Edoofa, and let me tell you that they have made so many Indian friends, and some of them are even quite fluent in speaking Hindi now, so you are totally safe here as Edoofa will always have your back.
8/3/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Thank you for the advice
8/3/24, 3:36 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK thank you
8/3/24, 3:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: You are welcome.
8/3/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Is the next session on Monday

11/3/24, 1:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay Shalom!
11/3/24, 1:34 PM - Tushti Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
11/3/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK ma'am am waiting
11/3/24, 1:38 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 525 0679: L am done reading it
11/3/24, 2:09 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
11/3/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK the first project involves looking for alliances for Edoofa, arranging for a meeting and the signing of a contract.

The second project is about reaching out to people in my community and persuade them to be part of Edoofa. This is for those who graduated from senior secondary schools recently or in the past 6 months.

The third project is about reaching out to local schools seeking collaborations with Edoofa
11/3/24, 2:20 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Really great job Shalom! You really had a perfect understanding.
11/3/24, 2:21 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/3/24, 2:21 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 525 0679: OK l am done now
11/3/24, 2:32 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 525 0679: Having a clear understanding of the market l plan to enter in the future and prepare for it earlier.. Identity companies within my country or region. Share objectives and explain how Edoofa help in adapting necessary skills for future employability
11/3/24, 2:46 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Your understanding is awesome. I really appreciate.
11/3/24, 2:46 PM - Tushti Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I want to express my appreciation for your active participation and thoughtful engagement. Your dedication to the learning process is commendable.
