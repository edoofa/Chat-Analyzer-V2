13/2/24, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: It's a pleasure to meet you! Your enthusiasm for travel, tourism, and hospitality management is evident, and your goals are ambitious and exciting. Building a network of contacts within the industry is a fantastic step towards achieving success in your field.

13/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 789 9505: You are welcome.
13/2/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/2/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 789 9505: No ma'am I don't understand. Can you please share with me.
13/2/24, 9:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us discuss this further tomorrow at the same time.

Remember that your consistency is something that will earn you credits here, so be regular, and trust me, no one can stop you from being at the top! All the best, good day! 🚀
13/2/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Have a blessed day. Thank you.
14/2/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Praise!

How are you doing? Are you ready for the session?🚀
14/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Morning ma'am. I'm doing good. How are you ?
14/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am,I'm ready for the session
14/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/2/24, 8:51 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/2/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am,I understand
14/2/24, 8:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/2/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am
14/2/24, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ma'am
14/2/24, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
14/2/24, 9:19 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am,let me read the newsletter
14/2/24, 9:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/2/24, 9:26 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Sounds interesting ma'am and I hope I will meet those goals.
14/2/24, 10:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to move ahead with our session; something urgent came up that required my immediate attention. Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time.
14/2/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am. Have a good day.

I was also happy to meet with Mr Keshav who was my counsellor. I have learnt that Edoofa is a good scholarship program through the videos which were played on the projector.

These majestic creatures can weigh up to 6 metric tons (approximately 13,000 pounds) and are known for their intelligence, complex social structures, and remarkable memory. Isn't that incredible?_

26/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process! <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am
26/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
26/2/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 789 9505: The main aim is to understand the market you are going to work for in the future and start preparing for it at a very early stage. First an foremost one has to create a LinkedIn account . This is a business platform where you can look for companies as well as the employees who are working for those companies. This is where we can connect with the decision makers of that company.
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good work, Praise!🌟
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
26/2/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/2/24, 9:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I want you to read the document and share your understanding with me before our next session so that we can make the most out of it.
26/2/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 789 9505: We have to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and they should be willing to extend their help in the overall development of all students. To look for these companies,one must consider (i) nature of the company (ii) financial stability of that company (iii) background of the founder (iv) scale of that company
26/2/24, 4:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good work, Praise! Now let us connect tomorrow to discuss this further!🚀
27/2/24, 10:54 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263787899505 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect today for our session. Our whole team was involved in an important meeting with Mr. Angad, where we discussed crucial strategies to enhance your skills and readiness for employment. I hope that together, we will work hard and fulfill our dreams.

27/2/24, 3:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: During my discussion with Mr. Angad today, I realized the need for more efficient and effective sessions with my students to expedite our progress.

27/2/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am ,will catch up at 1:30PM
28/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Praise!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Afternoon ma'am. How are you?
28/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 789 9505: This message was deleted

4/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

4/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 789 9505: Okay ma'am ,I get it
4/3/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
4/3/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

4/3/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.
