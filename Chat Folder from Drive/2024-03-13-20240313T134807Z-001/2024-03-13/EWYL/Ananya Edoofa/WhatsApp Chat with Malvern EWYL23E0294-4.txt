19/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 756 9307: Good morning. I am father of Malvern. Malvern is nolonger a prospective Edoofian. I faced hurdles with Paypal to make payments to Edoofa. I made 2 attempts but each time my account was being debited but the payments would not go through and was being reversed. I tried to get help from Admissions team for way forward, but they have been quite. As a result  i had to withdraw the money and pay somewhere else as cash. So i and Malvern nolonger belong to Edoofa family. You.may cancel all programs with Malvern and delete this group. I want to thank you very much for the time we had been together.
