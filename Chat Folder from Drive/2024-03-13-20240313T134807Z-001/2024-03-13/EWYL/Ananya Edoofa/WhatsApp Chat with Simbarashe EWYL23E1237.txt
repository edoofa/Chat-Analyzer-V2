Also, don't forget to review what we covered last.🌟
21/2/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I really did enjoy it, it was an exciting event to be apart of. I would, however, like to suggest maybe next time if you could offer small finger snacks or even water, just to keep up refreshed throughout the event. Other than that, I truly enjoyed, I even had the change to meet a few new people and bumped into some friends from school
21/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Afternoon, how are you?
21/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Im ready for the session

21/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
21/2/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/2/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Thank you very much Miss Ananya, it's very nice to meet you
21/2/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
21/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Okay

To begin with, I have a passion in Photography, taking pictures in general particularly pictures of people. Additionally, I have a passion for music, I love listening to music every chance I get. My goal, is to be able to leave Zimbabwe, travel the world and return with enough knowledge and resources to be able to enrich the lives of my family back at home and even the lives of those around me.
21/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Why don't you share a few photos with me?
21/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 702 5922: <Media omitted>

21/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 702 5922: what I like about photography is that you can sort of tell a story just by looking at a picture
21/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! Photography has this amazing ability to capture moments and convey emotions, stories, and messages without words. Each photograph holds a narrative within its frame, allowing viewers to interpret and connect with the story behind the image.
21/2/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I really hope that I'd be able to get a good camera before leaving for India so I can capture every moment of my journey
21/2/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, have you captured these without a camera?
21/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 702 5922: my camera is really getting old. Although I know that the camera doesn't determine the picture, but the actual person taking the picture.

im just hoping that I can get a newer camera with relatively newer technologies
21/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 702 5922: with that being said, I also wouldn't mind using the one I have
21/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Simbarashe, these pictures are equally amazing and I am sure you will be able to get a new camera!🚀
21/2/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Thank you!

I also wanted to know, while I'm studying my course will I be given an opportunity to visit Zimbabwe?
22/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

I hope you are doing well, how are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
22/2/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, I want to give you an update that our team is taking off tomorrow and won't have any sessions over the weekend. Let's reconvene and continue our discussions on Monday. Have a nice weekend!

27/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

Before we dive into today's session, here's a fun fact about parrots: Did you know that parrots are one of the few animal species that can mimic human speech? Some parrots, like the African grey parrot, have been known to learn hundreds of words and even use them in context! Isn't that amazing?🦜
27/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 702 5922: That is amazing! I had a friend in South Africa who had an African Grey
27/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's lovely! However, why are you late?
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: im very sorry for being late, I'm at school and right now I have a free lesson
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: and my network here at school is not very good
27/2/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 702 5922: im so sorry for any inconvenience
28/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

I understand that, however since it is important to complete your orientation for your EWYL journey, I would suggest that your parents can attend the sessions with me, what do you think?
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I think that can be a good idea
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 702 5922: may you please add my father into this group chat

29/2/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Simbarashe, I was hoping to hear from you. Can you please let me know why you were unable to attend your session?
29/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 702 5922: im so sorry, I am currently writing mock exams, for the next few days until after Tuesday
29/2/24, 2:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so how's your preparation going?
29/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 702 5922: it is going pretty well thank you for asking, I've been doing discussions with a small group of classmates, just making sure that we are all ready for the upcoming tests

4/3/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: Wow that's interesting!
4/3/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Simbarashe, did your father join the group?

8/3/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbarashe!

Before we commence today's session, let's take a moment to recognize and celebrate International Women's Day. Have you extended your best wishes to the incredible women in your life?👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏽
8/3/24, 1:46 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Good afternoon.  I hope you are well. Happy women's day to all the women!

8/3/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Simbarashe* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
8/3/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect on Monday at 1:30 PM, as we do not have our sessions over the weekend! Happy weekend!🚀
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Simbararshe

I hope you're doing well. To kick things off, I have a delightful video to share with you: *https://youtu.be/RRDsLQs3rzw*

Take a moment to watch it, and I'd love to hear your thoughts afterward!
11/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 702 5922: good afternoon miss, I'll make sure to watch it as soon as a get home!

11/3/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
