28/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with another fact! 

_Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is biologically immortal? Yes, you heard that right! The Turritopsis dohrnii jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, essentially resetting its life cycle. Imagine being able to hit the 'reset' button on life like that! If only we humans had the same ability on Mondays, right?_😅🪼
28/2/24, 1:47 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes you are right
28/2/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
28/2/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/2/24, 1:55 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm glad to meet you madam, I hope my education journey will be very fruitful when I work together with you
28/2/24, 1:59 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Based on the jelly fish, my question is, would you please share me the life cycle of a jelly fish?
28/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Jellyfish start as tiny larvae called planulae. They attach to a surface and become polyps. Polyps bud off tiny jellyfish called medusae. These medusae grow into adult jellyfish, which release eggs and sperm into the water for reproduction. Jellyfish can live for different lengths of time, depending on the species.
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
28/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
28/2/24, 2:12 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm Joseph Jungubawa, I'm a Malawian, I studied my secondary school at Maranatha High school Academy, based on my passion I would like to be a Doctor, when it comes to my hobbies I like physical exercises and football.Interms of my goals, actually my short-term goal is get bachelor's degree in physiotherapy but my long-term goal is to get a PhD in physiotherapy
28/2/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: It's wonderful to learn more about you. Pursuing a career in medicine as a doctor is admirable, and your dedication to achieving this goal is commendable. Your passion for physical exercises and football shows a commitment to staying active and healthy, which is fantastic. It's great to hear about your goals, with your short-term aim of obtaining a bachelor's degree in physiotherapy and your long-term aspiration to earn a PhD in the field. Keep working hard towards your dreams, Joseph!
28/2/24, 2:15 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam for your encouragement
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/2/24, 2:20 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It's only my father
28/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 2:24 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: I am McJoseph the father of Joseph currently in Mzuzu North of Malawi

28/2/24, 2:35 PM - +265 991 59 81 60: Thank you have a good day too
29/2/24, 1:30 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon Madam
29/2/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

I hope you are doing well. Are you ready to move ahead with our discussion?🚀
29/2/24, 1:33 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm doing well

I'm ready Madam
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/2/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm ready to work with you so as to meet the two objectives
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms. Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have Ms. Davi, Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/2/24, 1:52 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks Madam
I will waiting for you to introduce me
29/2/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 2 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/2/24, 2:07 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes I'm ready to go though this process
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/2/24, 2:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes I have finish reading
29/2/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at 1:30 PM. Have a good day!🚀
29/2/24, 2:35 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
Good day to you too
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon madam
4/3/24, 8:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Joseph!

I hope you are doing well. Please excuse me for not being able to connect. Due to a family emergency, I was off for a day, and then it was the weekend.

Let us connect today at 1:30 PM to move ahead!
4/3/24, 8:19 AM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam
4/3/24, 8:19 AM - +265 883 80 68 83: It's OK we will connect by 1 30 pm
4/3/24, 1:30 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Gud afternoon madam
4/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with a mind-blowing fact: The human brain is more active during sleep than it is while watching TV! While you're catching those Z's, your brain is busy processing memories, consolidating information, and even problem-solving. It's like a bustling city that never sleeps inside your head! So next time you're snoozing, remember, that your brain is hard at work.🧠😴
4/3/24, 1:33 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: How're you doing Madam
4/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: How is active during sleep time?
4/3/24, 1:35 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Would you please explain it madam I want to know
4/3/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I could not understand your question, can you please help me?
4/3/24, 1:44 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: You said that a human brain is more active during sleep time, so I was I was asking how does that happen??

I was thinking that during sleep time the brain is at rest.
4/3/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The human brain does indeed remain active during sleep, but it's important to note that this activity varies throughout the different stages of sleep. During REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is when most dreaming occurs, the brain's activity is actually quite similar to wakefulness in some aspects, including increased brain wave activity and processing of memories and emotions. However, during non-REM sleep, the brain's activity decreases compared to wakefulness, but it still engages in important functions such as memory consolidation and repair processes.

Comparing this to watching TV, where the brain is often in a more passive state, the statement highlights the dynamic nature of brain activity during sleep and emphasizes the significance of sleep for various cognitive processes. So, while it might seem like you're just resting during sleep, your brain is actually quite busy carrying out essential tasks.
4/3/24, 1:52 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam I now understand
4/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
4/3/24, 1:58 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Section 2 mostly
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
4/3/24, 1:59 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Yes in section 1
4/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So,  At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
4/3/24, 2:02 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It sounds great madam
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
4/3/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from your end, but since we couldn't connect, I'm looking forward to connecting with you positively tomorrow. Let's aim for a productive discussion then. Have a great day!
4/3/24, 3:01 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I have finished it now
4/3/24, 3:02 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks have a great day
5/3/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Joseph!

Let us begin our session with a giggle: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award?'

Because he was outstanding in his field!😅
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Good afternoon madam
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I'm ready we can
5/3/24, 1:37 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Madam what is a scarecrow, I would like to know please?
5/3/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: OK thanks
5/3/24, 2:04 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Wait I'm typing
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: It is mostly associated with how a proud Edoofian can  display the projects of Edoofa to the world through education facilities or directly to friends, so as to make them part and parcel of Edoofa team,

For the process to be successful, there is use of internet platforms.

So a proud Edoofian gains the scholarship credits, as he or she is participating all the projects given,
For example for enloment of a single student 20 dollars is gained,

Successful completion of the student to be Member of Edoofa worths 30 dollars
5/3/24, 2:28 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: In the process of EWYL project skills like communication are gained, creativity thinking is also gained since some project there are not syllabus based.

7/3/24, 1:54 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Based on the guide for searching companies, a proud Edoofian needs to consider some factors like nature of company, scale of company, financial stability of company, and background of founder.

Nature of company involves what companies do in day to day time for example, social interaction platforms, carrier development platforms

Actually based on scale of company, it involves normal amount of people working in the company for the good range it's 50 to 200.

We also consider financial stability of company, the should be financially stable.

On the other hand we also consider the back ground of founder, this involves managerial experience and qualifications of the owner.

Using online platforms we can get connected to companies, so as to investigate them before considering them to work with Edoofa.
7/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Joseph, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

7/3/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

7/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it, Joseph!
7/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 2:23 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: The audio, is emphasising much on awareness campaign about Edoofa programs.

A proud Edoofian needs to search for for students who are academically eligible and we should tell them more about the the Edoofa program,for example how Edoofa projects work.

In the case that the student is willing to study abroad, I as a member of Edoofa I'm supposed to share some knowledge concerning Edoofa programs.

In the case that the student is willing, we can then consult his or her parents and tell them more about Edoofa education programs.

*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024 or August 2025
8/3/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/3/24, 1:56 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: Thanks madam I will do it accordingly
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
8/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

For this to be successful, I as a proud Edoofian I am supposed to communicate effectively with the principles and head masters of various high schools in my region so as to open them in details about the Edoofa program to the world students.

In the condition that the meeting is successful, using the online created group I am supposed to connect the principles and headmasters with my EWYL mentor for further clarification of the details about Edoofa program.
11/3/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
11/3/24, 2:24 PM - +265 883 80 68 83: I would like to ask this question, in case that I have not met serious and eligible students to get enrolled in the Edoofa program, is there another way I can manage to get scholarship credits?
