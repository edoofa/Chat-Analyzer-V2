7/1/24, 9:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Luckson!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 9:53 AM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
12/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Luckson!

20/2/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Hello, Luckson!

The past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
21/2/24, 12:44 AM - +263 78 445 1889: These gatherings should be done every as it gives both students and parents better insights of the programme. It also enables parents to ask Iquestions on face to the Indian counsellors directly and this gives them hope about their children  when they will be studying in India. I think they should try to have these gstherings at least two times in different places so that even those from areas far from Harare will catch up easily for example may be having gathering in Harare and then the other one in Gweru I think more students will attend the gatherings... This gatherings enables parents to ask questions and get the answers directly as this gives better hope of the programme activities

Due to the Africa trip and missed sessions, it seems we've slowed down a bit. To streamline our sessions and ensure we make the most of our time together, I've decided to *change our meeting time to 8:30 am in the morning*

Starting tomorrow, *we'll connect daily at 8:30 am for the next few days.* Once I see that your goals and targets are clear and well-defined, we can transition to meeting only twice a week.

Looking forward to our session tomorrow. Have a fantastic day!
