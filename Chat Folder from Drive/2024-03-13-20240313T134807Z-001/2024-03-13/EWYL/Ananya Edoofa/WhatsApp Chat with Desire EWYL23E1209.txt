Let us begin our session with an amazing fact! 

_*Did you know that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus? Even though it only takes Venus about 225 Earth days to go around the sun, it spins really slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to turn once on its axis. So, a day on Venus is longer than a whole year there!*_ 🫨 <This message was edited>

5/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for asking, I am doing good!
5/2/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
5/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 126 3228: That’s fine
5/2/24, 8:41 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Hello,  well My name is Desire Rudairo C Chiminya , and I am thrilled to connect with you all. I am  turning 18 years old . I’m dedicated to be a computer engineer.

5/2/24, 8:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you, Desire Rudairo C Chiminya! 🎉 Turning 18, that's awesome! Happy early birthday! 🎂 Being dedicated to becoming a computer engineer is fantastic. It's a cool field! 🖥️

I see you're into music too—nice! 🎶 What kind of music are you into? Any favorite artists or genres?
5/2/24, 8:48 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Thank you so much , yea that’s my dream

Well i listen to all genres ,
5/2/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 126 3228: I also listen to Zakir Hussain
5/2/24, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Really? Wow! I also like him, which song is your favorite?
5/2/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes , Sitar
5/2/24, 8:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Amazing! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 78 126 3228: No you can share with me
5/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/2/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
5/2/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/2/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
5/2/24, 9:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/2/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Yes
5/2/24, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

7/2/24, 8:38 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Desire!

Let us begin our session with a fact about elephants: Did you know that elephants are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror? This ability indicates a level of self-awareness that is rare in the animal kingdom and suggests that elephants have a complex understanding of themselves and their surroundings. 🐘

13/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 126 3228: Noted
13/2/24, 8:43 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
13/2/24, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Using WhatsApp Community Groups for Outreach:*
*Step 1*: Create a WhatsApp group and name it using the format STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY. For example, if you're the mentor, it would be *MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*.

*Step 2*: Find the right students for your group to ensure effective communication about Edoofa.

*Purpose*: The goal is to reach a broad audience, providing accurate information about Edoofa to prepare them for a smooth counseling session.
13/2/24, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Execution:

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
13/2/24, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

You would have effectively shared information about Edoofa with a minimum of 120 students, creating awareness and interest among potential applicants. This method ensures a wide reach and prepares students for the upcoming counseling sessions.

13/2/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
13/2/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
