I can see that there is a slight delay in our conversation, actually due to a family emergency, I was on a day off and then it was a weekend. However, now that I am here, I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.
