7/1/24, 8:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary. <This message was edited>

I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

I won't spill all the details here, but I've recorded a special audio message filled with enthusiasm, encouragement and a whole lot of excitement. Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 8 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges? <This message was edited>

I hope you're doing well. I know we haven't been able to connect for our sessions lately, but I just wanted to touch base with you. Last week, we talked about your performance, and I want you to know that I'm really happy with how you've been doing. It's important to keep up the good work and stay focused on our goals.

Since it's a new month, I'm thinking about setting a target for you. This week, I'd like you to reach out to 8 students and help them with their application forms. Even though we might not be meeting regularly right now, you need to keep striving for your targets and maintaining your performance. Consistency is key to your future success.

These pictures are beautiful! Seems like I have missed a lot of fun!🥹

By the way, the past three days flew by in a whirlwind for Team Edoofa – both for those in India and those in Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that we've had a chance to catch our breath, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.

Your insights from the event are highly valued, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Additionally, if you have captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate you sharing them.

Your perspective is crucial, and I also encourage you to discuss the event with your parents and gather their feedback.🌟
20/2/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 691 8061: Good afternoon madam  

Firstly I would like to thank you for making me join the team. To be honest I felt greatly honored when you told me I'm part of the coordination team  


And I also want to tell you that we really enjoyed being with some mentors, educational councilors and even the founder himself. We also learned new skills from the event from reception management, ushering skills, PA system controls, invigilation and many other chores given to us as a team 

I think events like these are to be done twice or thrice a year because it creates opportunities for learning different skills . It also helped us get full insight of Edoofa scholarship fund's journey how it started where it is going and also their vision .
 

To be honest with you madam I would like to continue working with you on similar events 
Plus I would like to be part of the guys for the next years SLICE CON  and similar events when we reach India
