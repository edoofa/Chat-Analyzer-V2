12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Emmanuel,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 6:29 PM - +265 999 31 88 35: Good story to hear. Well done
12/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

13/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Emmanuel.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your MSCE results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their MSCE results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your MSCE results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

17/1/24, 8:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Emmanuel.

I hope you are doing well. Thank your for sharing this, however, we would require the picture of the result please, so may I know by when will you be able to share the same?
25/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Emmanuel,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
12/3/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/3/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Emmanuel

I hope this message finds you well. With regard to our conversation previously while I was going through your scholarship application today I noticed you have not shared your *MSCE results* with us, may I know when will you be able to share the same so that we can update your application file as well?
