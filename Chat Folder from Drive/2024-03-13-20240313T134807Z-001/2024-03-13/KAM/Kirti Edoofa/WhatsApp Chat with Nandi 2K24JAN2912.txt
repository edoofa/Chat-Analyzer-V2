I come to you concerning the summit that Will be held in Harare. Will there be any summit that will be held in Bulawayo after this one because l am currently having a financial crisis since we are clearing the balance for my A level.

I am very far from Harare and traveling will be a lot of money. I also don't have anyone l know from that side and this will need me to book in a lodge for the night but unfortunately l can not afford that.

I was hoping that you will have another summit in Bulawayo so it will be easy for me to attend.

I hope my problem will be taken into consideration, however if this is the only summit that will be held we will try and make arrangements for me to attend.
13/2/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 899 4760: Good morning

You can update the EWYL availability date to the 27th of February and the orientation date to the 28th since previously your EWYL batch was to start on the 20th of February, however, we have not made any progress and have not even reached step 1 of the admission cycle hence I suggest you start your EWYL from the next batch which is 27th of February.

Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
22/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I am available.
22/2/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/2/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, we can start.
22/2/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I am done.
22/2/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/2/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes they are clear.
22/2/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/2/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes I am following.
22/2/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/2/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes they are clear.
22/2/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, we can.
22/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/2/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
22/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright.
22/2/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we can start.
22/2/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes you can share.
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
22/2/24, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

26/2/24, 12:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/HsJJBFnXKVZD2spQ0dTxNu

26/2/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
26/2/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright l will update you
26/2/24, 12:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.

26/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you.
26/2/24, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Nandi.

I trust you are in good health and had a wonderful weekend, with regard to our conversation earlier may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
26/2/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes l managed to go through them.
26/2/24, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, please share your understanding of the 4 videos.
26/2/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 626 4514: From the videos l understood that the state mental of Purpose is the only document that can convince any school why l am worth to be given an admission letter. The SOP should also involve my wishes, why l chose that particular course and my experience.

I also understood that it is important to follow the instructions given by the Edoofa team. It is impossible to get the scholarship without following the protocol. I got that as a student l have to be open minded enough to follow the instructions. The Edoofa also focuses on increasing student's capacity for success, thus making us students more responsible and independent.

I also understood that a lot of time is taken in finding the right schools with Edoofa. We don't have to worry about which school l am to go to because they do all the work to ensure that we receive quality education which is also affordable. Other agents only focus on making money not on the quality education the students have to receive.
26/2/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
26/2/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
26/2/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
26/2/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
26/2/24, 7:05 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you for your views they really helped me understand more.
26/2/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/2/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we are.
26/2/24, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 pm.
26/2/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright.
26/2/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

26/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:30 pm, I hope you will be available to connect with us.
26/2/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I will be available.
26/2/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Have a blessed night ahead and do convey my regards to you family as well.
26/2/24, 7:17 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you have a blessed night too.

27/2/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nandi.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
27/2/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
27/2/24, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we move forward.  I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 6th March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we are well aware of the balance.
27/2/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
27/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes I am ready.
27/2/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/2/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/2/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/2/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes.
27/2/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/2/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/2/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/2/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, we discussed about it.
27/2/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we are on the same page.
27/2/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/2/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
27/2/24, 8:40 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes.
27/2/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/2/24, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/2/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright, l understand.
27/2/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/2/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/2/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/2/24, 8:48 PM - +263 77 626 4514: This is so awesome.
27/2/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/2/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 626 4514: So far l don't have any questions.
27/2/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/2/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/2/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/2/24, 8:53 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, l can already feel the excitement.
27/2/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/2/24, 8:54 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, l am very curious to know?
27/2/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/2/24, 8:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
27/2/24, 8:56 PM - +263 77 626 4514: No l am not aware?
27/2/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/2/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/2/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/2/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It's clear.
27/2/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/2/24, 9:03 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes, l am actually thrilled.
27/2/24, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
27/2/24, 9:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright.

Thank you so much, have a blessed night also.
28/2/24, 4:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nandi,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It was really an awesome moment. I got to understand a lot about Edoofa. I met students that are Edoofians and they shared their experiences with me.

I got to realize that with Edoofa quality education is what is more important than money. I got a chance to talk with Mr. Angad Signh and understand more about Edoofa.
29/2/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nandi.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 626 4514: No, we don't know.
29/2/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 , there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Oh yes, l did not get the chance to meet one on one. I had to go board a bus and travel back home  early.

However l got a chance to meet with Mr. Angad Signh and talk to him, l also asked some questions that I needed clarity on.
29/2/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear. I will make arrangements for you to connect with seminar attendees and their parents tomorrow. Hearing firsthand experiences will provide valuable insights.
29/2/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
29/2/24, 8:21 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I resonated most with the videos of the Edoofians telling us about their experiences in India.

We got to understand a lot about Edoofa, as most parents told us how they thought Edoofa was a scam but now they are enjoying a lot yet benefiting because their children have a new home in the Edoofa program
1/3/24, 7:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Thank you for sharing that. Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
3/3/24, 10:12 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Good day.
3/3/24, 10:13 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we have discussed, and we were looking forward to me going to university on Augast
4/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Thank you for letting me know that. I appreciate your transparency. Educational planning requires careful consideration and wise decisions, areas where Edoofa has excelled over our 15-year journey. As Edoofa’s Parent Organization marks its 15th Anniversary on May 11th, our commitment to guiding students like yourself towards successful careers remains steadfast.
4/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
4/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
4/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
4/3/24, 8:56 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes l am very aware as the rates continue to rise.
4/3/24, 8:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad. 

Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.

What are your thoughts on these challenges,? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe? <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 9:02 AM - +263 77 626 4514: I will say they are common occurrences because the number of such cases continue to rise. Even in small cities it is no longer safe for anyone to travel at night.
4/3/24, 9:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is quite unfortunate name and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities. In light of that may I know how is your preparation for the registration fee going on?
4/3/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 626 4514: It is going well if I can say, we are waiting for the the offer letter.
4/3/24, 9:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, and it is good to know that you are preparing hard for your registration fee, once we get updates from the university we shall notify you till then I hope you have a great day today, feel free to reach out to me if you have any concerns to share with us.
4/3/24, 9:16 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright.
5/3/24, 8:36 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Good day.

May l please know when l can expect the offer form.
6/3/24, 9:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nandi.

I hope you are doing well. I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
6/3/24, 9:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents today at 2:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 9:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

6/3/24, 9:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you so much.

I will be available.
6/3/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 626 4514: May l please have contacts of someone who is in Galgotias University, l want to connect with them.
6/3/24, 10:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion at 02:00 pm?
6/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Good afternoon.
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you for this opportunity.
6/3/24, 2:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/3/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 626 4514: My first question is on the date of issue.

Looking at it and the time frame of 2 weeks they are giving, the letter will now be invalid.
6/3/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Most of your inquiries will be covered in our upcoming conversation. Should any questions remain unanswered by the conclusion of our discussion, we will make sure to address those as well. I trust this approach aligns with your preferences, and I anticipate our forthcoming discussion?
6/3/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It is OK with me.
6/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 626 4514: 1.$900
2.4 years
3.$300
4.$750
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes it does.
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I understand.
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes it does.
6/3/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 626 4514: So this examination fee is not part of the tuition fee?
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 It is a part of the tuition fee only, however, this message was to make you understand what all is being included so that you have a better understanding.

May I know if you are clear?
6/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Meaning it is part of the $900
6/3/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, stay assured we will be sharing a fee breakup as well as we move ahead with our discussion.
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright, it's now clear.
6/3/24, 2:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/3/24, 2:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 20th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/3/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 626 4514: No, my concern is on the date of issue. It say 15 February 2024 meaning the letter is now invalid.
6/3/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding that let me update the team about the same, it must have been a clerical error by the university and the team will get it updated, so please do not worry.
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright.
6/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Is it possible to get contacts of someone who is from Zimbabwe and is studying there so l can have someone l can count on.
6/3/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 as I mentioned earlier, I will surely be helping you with that as well, all I would need is for you to be a little patient please.
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It's alright.
6/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you
6/3/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming to how you can pay this $750 I hope you recall our previous discussion where we discussed a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes,l remember that l have to pay the $500 within 15 days and the rest within the next 30 days.
6/3/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you here. This $750 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$375 before the first deadline date of 20th March 2024* 

2. A subsequent payment of *$375  before the second deadline date of 20th April 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $ 750 within 15 working days, before *March 20th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright, thank you for shedding some light on that.
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/3/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 626 4514: No, l don't stay in Harare.


Where l stay it's 12 hours away from Harare.
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
6/3/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC
Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004
Swift Code: FBCPZWHA
Sort Code: 8127
6/3/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 626 4514: So l can send the money to Mr Rajan Nayer from the FBC bank in any other city,like Bulawayo?
6/3/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Am asking this because I don't have anyone in Harare.
6/3/24, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you can make the deposit from FBC bank in Bulawayo to the above details just in mind the this FBC account branch is in Harare only.
6/3/24, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/3/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes please.
6/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
6/3/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Alright thank you.
6/3/24, 3:12 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I will wait for the clarity on dates of the offer letter before making any payment.
6/3/24, 3:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
6/3/24, 3:16 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It's clear
6/3/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, if I am getting your well here and if I am correct by clarity on dates, you mean that you would need the updated letter from the university with the issue date of today?
6/3/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes.
6/3/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. You know since India is 3.5 hours ahead of Zimbabwe, the office hours for the university are now closed, so upon your request, they will be re-issuing your offer letter tomorrow again and sending you over mail, so stay assured about that and you can start preparing for your registration fee.
6/3/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
6/3/24, 3:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/3/24, 3:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
6/3/24, 3:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
6/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes l understand.
6/3/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
6/3/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
6/3/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/3/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes it does.
6/3/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/3/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to inquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/3/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I wanted to ask if I was accepted in Galgotias University only?
6/3/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
6/3/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
6/3/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
6/3/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
6/3/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we are, but what if the other universities reply after l have paid the registration fee.?
6/3/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
6/3/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 626 4514: No am not.

Will l have to pay the registration fee again?
6/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
6/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes it is clear.
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritises the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities.

6/3/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Thank you, let me go through these.
6/3/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents
6/3/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
6/3/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be tomorrow. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
6/3/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes it does.
6/3/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
7/3/24, 7:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 899 4760: Good morning let me ask is it allowed to find us other university beside this one
8/3/24, 8:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nandi.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your concern, however, I would like to know if you were able to go through the Transfer option I explained earlier about?
8/3/24, 8:07 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we managed to, but our concern is what if I don't get accepted at any other university, l will be forced to study at this one.
8/3/24, 8:07 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Good  morning.
8/3/24, 8:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 May I know why you think that way is there any particular reason which you think you will not be able to get accepted at other universities?
8/3/24, 8:18 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Not at all, it's just a concern.
8/3/24, 8:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263776264514 when you enrolled in Edoofa, your application was thoroughly checked and after your eligibility was confirmed then only our counselors moved forward with your application, so if you have this concern you can stay assured that you are indeed eligible for other universities as well. In fact, if you look at the transfer option is it an additional benefit for you, as you will be able reserve your seat and still have the options to explore more, you even need to consider the bigger picture here?
8/3/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes I am considering that.
8/3/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know now looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
8/3/24, 11:14 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Yes we did, but they were not so keen on joining this university.
8/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why, what was the discussion like, could you share more insights?
8/3/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 626 4514: They searched the university and found out that it is near the village than the city so it will require me to travel for anything l will need even if it's something small.

This will cause a strain on my financial and academic life
8/3/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: We as parents are not comfortable with the process. The acceptance letter is dated 15 February and we only got it on the 6th of March, rendering it invalid. We feel there is something amiss there. We can not take such a monetary risk and also risk with our child.
8/3/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: The fact that they are sending another one with a different letter, even makes alarm bells go off harder! Sounds fraudulent to me, we just can't take that risk
8/3/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 626 4514: These were the views of other guardians
8/3/24, 12:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing all your concerns, let me help you understand them one by one. Regarding your first concern about the locality of the university, may I know why you think it is near a village, Galgotias University is situated within the capital of India which is Delhi- NCR, so I am not able to understand your concern regarding the locality here?
8/3/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding the second concern about the offer letter issue, I previously informed you about the clerical error from the university's side. Upon your request, I promptly communicated with the team to obtain the updated letter. You specifically mentioned needing the new letter with the current issue date. However, I clarified that during our discussion, the university's admin office was closed due to a 3.5-hour time difference.
8/3/24, 12:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I made it a priority to share the reissued letter with you on the morning of the 7th of March, as soon as the admin office resumed operations. The issue date on the reissued letter was the same day I provided it to you. I'm having difficulty understanding your concern, @263776264514 , especially considering we promptly addressed your request and shared the updated letter following your confirmation. If there's a specific issue or misunderstanding, I'm here to assist further.
8/3/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I understand the issue of location, thank you for the correction.
8/3/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 626 4514: I really understand, but my parents are hell bent on finding another university, instead of Galgotias.
8/3/24, 12:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, that is exactly my question and I wish to know what other thoughts they have in mind because, regarding the reissue of the letter, you were the one who requested it in the first place right, so may be I will be able to understand better if I got to know what is exactly bothering them?
8/3/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 626 4514: It's the date of issue that painted another picture in them.

We should take not that these are the people that are going to be paying every fee needed, so they are really scared of loosing their money.
11/3/24, 8:25 AM - +263 77 626 4514: Good morning
12/3/24, 11:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nandi.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you earlier, I was occupied with a meeting. However, I was able to go through the message you shared above. I understand the concern that your parents have in mind, however, you need to make them understand here, if you want I can schedule a with Mr. Austin, a senior career counselor at Edoofa so that your parents can have more clarity.
