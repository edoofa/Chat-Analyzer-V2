11/3/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Munotidaishe 2K24FEB2801)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
11/3/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Munotidaishe EWYL23E1380)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
11/3/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes I am
11/3/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
11/3/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 007 9629: I had a really helpful and insightful counseling session with my counselor.  They helped me to understand the Edoofa program and all of the benefits it offers.  I'm impressed by the individualized attention and support that Edoofa provides, as well as the high quality of the courses.  I'm excited to make the most of my experience and to explore all of the opportunities that Edoofa has to offer.
11/3/24, 11:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience! I have known Mr. Keshav for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track. Your enthusiasm to make the most of this experience and explore all the opportunities Edoofa has to offer is commendable.
11/3/24, 11:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
11/3/24, 11:37 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes you can

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes let's start
12/3/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 007 9629: OK I'm done
12/3/24, 9:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/3/24, 9:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/3/24, 10:02 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes
12/3/24, 10:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/3/24, 10:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/3/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes I understand
12/3/24, 10:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/3/24, 10:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/3/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes thank you I've understood
12/3/24, 10:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/3/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes
12/3/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/3/24, 10:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
12/3/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 007 9629: I'll be done watching the videos at 11.30am <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 10:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I shall wait for your response.
12/3/24, 12:01 PM - +263 78 007 9629: I'm done watching the videos
12/3/24, 12:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Could you please, share your understanding of the 4 videos  with us?
12/3/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 007 9629: Okay 
From the four videos I understood that the key qualities of successful Edoofians are to follow instructions and being open-minded.  These two qualities are essential for students in the Edoofa program to be successful.
Also the Edoofa vision is not only to give affordable quality education and making the students employable through the Earn  While You  Learn Program but to increase students capacity for success thus making them responsible and independent. 
The founders said that one must be prompt in taking action and be more diligent in filling the forms. They also said that the Statement of Purpose is important because it helps students to get acceptance into the prestigious institutions.
12/3/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
12/3/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/3/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/3/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/3/24, 12:49 PM - +263 78 007 9629: Thank you so much .  Your insights are really helpful and they allowed me to expand my own understanding.  I'm so grateful for your guidance and support.
12/3/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/3/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 007 9629: Yes we are
12/3/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:30 AM. <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
