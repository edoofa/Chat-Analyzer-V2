11/3/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group.

If yes could you please help me with their good names, the numbers they would be using and how would you want me to address them?

11/3/24, 10:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?

11/3/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
11/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 77 931 6003: Okay
11/3/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (March 15th) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
11/3/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

11/3/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
11/3/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Leo 2K24FEB2111R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
11/3/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Leo EWYL23E1301)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
11/3/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 931 6003: All clear
11/3/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

Especially the EWYL program is a great aspect of the program since things here in Zimbabwe are a bit challenging
11/3/24, 11:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know about your experience. It's fantastic to hear that our Scholarship Program has made a positive impression on you, and you find the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program particularly appealing. Indeed, programs like EWYL can be a significant support, through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
11/3/24, 11:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

12/3/24, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright please @263773090950 I completely understand that network can be a challenge.
12/3/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 309 0950: Welcome.

12/3/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/3/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 931 6003: I'm ready
12/3/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 931 6003: I am done
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/3/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 931 6003: All clear
12/3/24, 1:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/3/24, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 931 6003: I am following
12/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 931 6003: All clear
12/3/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 931 6003: Yes we can
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
12/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 931 6003: Yes
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

12/3/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
12/3/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
12/3/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
12/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 931 6003: Right now my internet connection is poor
Maybe it will be restored later in the day
I will let you know if I'm back online
12/3/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please you can go through the videos and complete the EWYL form by tomorrow and let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am.
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 931 6003: Noted
