This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
1/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 219 1395: OK kindly noted ma'am.
1/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 219 1395: It's OK no problem. I'm following.
1/3/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
1/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 219 1395: OK. During my counseling session the EWYL program fascinated me the most and the recruitment partners. What really impressed was the issue that with EWYL l can earn credit and get to lessen the burden for my parents on tuition fee.
1/3/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience. I am glad to know that the EWYL program was able to catch your attention, through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/3/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam
6/3/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Go ahead

6/3/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/3/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/3/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam , quite clear
6/3/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/3/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam still together
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/3/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/3/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam quite clear and understood
6/3/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/3/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Alright Madam we're ready
6/3/24, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/3/24, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
6/3/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 343 5521: Yes Madam
6/3/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

And one of the points they reiterated was that they assist a child by helping him or gain a scholarship and also scoop scholarship credits. They also mentioned the role of Edoofa in the education system particularly higher education particularly on the challenge of exorbitant fees. They also spoke of their role in  parenting Edoofians to become better students and how they are bridging the gap of nowadays parenting of spoiling children and not exposing them to real life situations
8/3/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 219 1395: I have listened to this one it's about the protocols, procedure, documentation undertaken by an Edoofian to secure admission place to different universities that meets Edoofa's criteria of the best  university.
8/3/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 219 1395: These are the videos that l managed to watch ma'am. Unfortunately l have run out of data. I will be able to watch the video when l reach home that's when l will have access to data.

https://chat.whatsapp.com/DqTd2xnb2hR7qm4hYfGbYB

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Petnet Chipatiso, and my EWYL group name is Petnet EWYL23E1323. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 12/03/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
11/3/24, 11:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
11/3/24, 11:29 AM - +263 78 219 1395: It's alright and noted.
11/3/24, 11:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
11/3/24, 11:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/3/24, 11:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/3/24, 11:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/3/24, 11:45 AM - +263 78 219 1395: OK following
11/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 219 1395: OK thank you ma'am. I had a better understanding of the videos.
11/3/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/3/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes We are on the same page maam
11/3/24, 12:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:30 AM. <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 12:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

12/3/24, 6:30 AM - +263 77 343 5521: Thanks Madam Kirti
12/3/24, 9:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Petnet.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form by now?
12/3/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Not yet ma'am lm working on it. Where l am its quite a distance to access airtime so l had arranged with someone to send me via online but l haven't yet received it. So as soon as she sends l will definitely do it.
12/3/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, could you please help me know a time by when can I expect a response from you?
12/3/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 219 1395: I'm hoping in an hour's time l would have filled the form
12/3/24, 9:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, we can continue with our discussion for now and after an hour you can share the SOP form with me here, may I know if that is suitable for you?
12/3/24, 9:50 AM - +263 78 219 1395: It's alright no problem maam
12/3/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now before we move forward. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 16th March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
12/3/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Thank you for that ma'am l actually thought it's end of month let me see to it that l pay my due.
12/3/24, 10:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
12/3/24, 10:15 AM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a master's degree in the course MBA for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
12/3/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes maam
12/3/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 219 1395: It's alright
12/3/24, 10:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - +263 78 219 1395: It's OK l am ready
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/3/24, 10:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/3/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 219 1395: @917292063289 ma'am Kirti  lm now filling the form for group name l write the name of this group right. I stand to be corrected
12/3/24, 10:46 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes @263782191395 you are absolutely correct for your reference let me share the group name again *Petnet 2K24FEB0668R*
12/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Thank you maam
12/3/24, 10:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I shall wait for your response.
12/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 219 1395: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 11:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form it is duly noted with us. May I know if you were able to go through my messages above?
12/3/24, 11:57 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes that's true
12/3/24, 11:58 AM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes l was able to go through them ma'am Kirti.
12/3/24, 12:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/3/24, 12:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/3/24, 12:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 219 1395: Yes thank you Ms Kirti. If l may ask ma'am how long does it take for the offer letter to arrive l mean approximately irregardless that universities differ.
12/3/24, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It depends upon the university how much time they take for the evaluation, the standard time is for a week.
12/3/24, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
