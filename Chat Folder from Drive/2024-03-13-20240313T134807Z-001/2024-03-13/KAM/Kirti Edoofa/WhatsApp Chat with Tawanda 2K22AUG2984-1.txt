12/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tawanda, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

17/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tawanda,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
17/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 738 8531: Afternoon ma'am how are you
24/1/24, 12:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tawanda,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 738 8531: Nothing much in it I didn't do much but it went quite well
24/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that your week went well. I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
24/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Civil Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering)
24/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Civil Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
24/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
24/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 385 1286: Yes
24/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering), which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
24/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.
24/1/24, 8:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
24/1/24, 8:45 PM - +263 77 738 8531: Yes you may
24/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from Btech Civil Engineering to Btech Computer Science Engineering for the intake 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail once done please share the screenshot with us so that we can even update the university officials.
24/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 77 738 8531: I was going to ask about that I've actually grown an interest in computers and I thought maybe I should tackle that field and this has become great news to me because I was wondering how I could break it down to you . However,don't they offer computer  (software) engineering other than computer science
24/1/24, 8:48 PM - +263 77 738 8531: Thank you
24/1/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777388531 through this subject you will even learn more about software, may I know if you would like me to explain more about the course?
24/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 77 738 8531: The Computer engineering I mean I'd more of the software world where I can learn more about websites and design involving designing,it uses the principles of both Compter science engineering and electrical engineering but in other countries it's based into two parts which are :
Software 
Hardware 
I want to do the software field more than the hardware if its impossible I'll have to specialise otherwise I'll just have to take software engineering
24/1/24, 8:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand the course better so that you will have a better understanding of the same.

24/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 738 8531: No I prefer computer engineering why ?

Because computer science is more theoretical and more about research where as computer engineering is more hands on and as much as computer science engineering I can aqcuire both hardware and software skills too
24/1/24, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's a well-thought-out preference for computer engineering. Indeed, your understanding of the differences between the two fields is quite accurate. However, let me help you have better clarity as well. Computer engineering's hands-on approach, with its emphasis on both hardware and software, can offer a more integrated experience that aligns with certain career paths and personal interests.
24/1/24, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: While computer science tends to be more theoretical, often delving deeper into computational theory, algorithms, and the like. On the other hand, computer science engineering provides a more balanced focus, blending the physical aspects of hardware with the intricacies of software. This dual focus can be particularly advantageous if you're interested in areas like embedded systems, hardware-software integration.
24/1/24, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ultimately, the choice between computer science and computer engineering depends on where your interests lie and what skills you most wish to develop. It's great to see you making a decision based on a clear understanding of your interests and the unique strengths of each field.
