I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the document, it is duly noted with us. We shall now share your application with the universities. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 248 3564: It's all fine thanks

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:30 PM to 03:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 248 3564: Yes please and thank you  for the opportunity.

17/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 77 248 3564: It's ok thank you
24/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Elshaddai,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 78 956 1557: We good glad to hear from you
24/1/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Elshaddai,

I trust you're well and that you had a productive weekend. I'm following up regarding the fee breakdown I shared with you on Saturday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Elshaddai,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Over the past couple of days, I have been reaching out to you to discuss your offer letter from *Galgotias University*, which is ranked in the top 100 universities in India. 

My intention is to help you understand the next steps for your university admission journey and guide you in the right direction. However, it seems as if my messages have not been able to get through.
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recognize, the Edoofa scholarship opportunity is highly competitive, with students from all over the world vying for the scholarship and you have been given a valuable chance to shape your future path.
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If I know you well from our past discussions, this is not something you will lose out on easily. Hence, that is the reason, I am a bit worried because you have not connected with us over the past couple of days. I believe something must have been bothering you that has prevented you from connecting with us. Is my understanding correct?
30/1/24, 6:57 PM - +27 60 485 9077: It's a gud evening
30/1/24, 6:59 PM - +27 60 485 9077: We are sorry we couldn't for the past days due to some other comitment ...nevertheless we will try b all means to attend this issue of paramount importance to us
30/1/24, 7:00 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I Kno sometimes we fail due to power issue coz the fons will be without much power ..,but we will try and make sure we do all what is necessary to pull thru within the timeframe expected
30/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, @27604859077, that you may have been occupied with prior commitments, which could explain why you haven't been able to connect with us. However, I noticed that none of your family members were available as well, which concerned us greatly. The offer letters you received are time-sensitive, and with each passing day, there's a risk of missing out on your scholarship opportunity.

Nevertheless, I am glad to see that you recognize these challenges and are willing to make an effort to be available over the next couple of days. Am I correct in understanding your situation?
30/1/24, 7:22 PM - +27 60 485 9077: Yes your understanding is correct and I think regardless of our challenges something can be done ....we will talk about it and see how best we can handle it
30/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, @27604859077, and if you are on the right track, I would want to do my very best to help you here. According to our previous discussions, you received an offer letter from Galgotias University, but we never had the chance to discuss the letter. The discussion will take at least 45 minutes of our time, and hence, I want to understand when we can discuss the same letter so that we can help you with the way forward before time runs out. When would be a convenient time for you to discuss this matter?
30/1/24, 8:58 PM - +27 60 485 9077: Thts what we are organizing to try and have someone available at convenient times
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see @27604859077, and I am glad to know that you are taking a step forward in the right direction. Since it has been a while since we last connected, I would like to inquire if you have had the opportunity to determine a suitable time for us to connect?

This way, we can discuss the scholarship offer letter you have before you miss out on the opportunity.
31/1/24, 4:09 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I am trying to connect with Elshaddai ...and he has been offline for some days now ...I wanted to inquire and get to Kno how far he too has grasped on this matter
31/1/24, 4:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern. It is important to ensure everyone is on the same page. Once he is back online, we can discuss his progress and ensure he's up to speed with the latest developments.
 
I would like you to note that our available hours are from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm CAT, and hence we would be available during the same time.

Hence, may I know by when you would be able to connect with him and let us know the time when you would be available to proceed?
31/1/24, 4:14 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I will give u feed back tomoro ...for now we may stick to tht time unless otherwise
31/1/24, 4:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I did not get you well @27604859077 when you mentioned that time. May I know which time are you referring to in your above message?
31/1/24, 4:15 PM - +27 60 485 9077: The time tht we are using now
31/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see @27604859077, however, it is already past 4:00 PM, and hence it would not be possible for us to connect at this hour. Considering this, you have to plan your schedule in a way that you can connect with us by 3:00 PM so that we can have a discussion before we close for the day.
31/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, since you mentioned that you are available right now, for today, I can extend my availability and help you understand the offer letter you have, considering we only have a limited period of time. This will ensure you do not miss out on anything else. Hence, could you let me know if you are available for us to continue?
31/1/24, 4:19 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I will be available tomoro same time sir
31/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, @27604859077. Just to confirm, are you available at 3:00 PM?
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I will make myself available
31/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright @27604859077. I am looking forward to getting an update from your end tomorrow. Elshaddai has been one of my favorite students since he started his admission journey, and seeing you in such a situation disheartens me. I want to help you here, and to do that, you have to take the first step and give me better clarity on what transpired and we hope to do that tomorrow.
31/1/24, 4:36 PM - +27 60 485 9077: Thank u very much
2/2/24, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Elshaddai

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you.
2/2/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 248 3564: M sorry for what you going through, may yiu you remain strong as you go through the challenges times.
2/2/24, 6:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772483564 Thank you for your concern, I really appreciate it. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 248 3564: I m at work now
2/2/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you must be occupied with work. In that case, may I know what time will you be able to connect with us tomorrow?
5/2/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Elshaddai,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm circling back regarding the earlier message I shared. While I was anticipating a response, it appears that my messages might not have reached you.

Hence, I'm reaching out today to inquire if you had the opportunity to review my previous message and to confirm if our communication is still ongoing.
10/2/24, 10:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings ELshaddai, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 11:12 AM - +27 60 485 9077: Hello Kirti it's a gud morning

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
4/3/24, 9:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. 

With regard to our conversation over the personal window, and as per your request let me share the message again.

4/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Hallo
4/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 956 1557: At the meeting  l was able  to connect  with some of the  edoofian candidates  the  time l had there was great. We wrote our exam and also got time to interact  with other kids there.l saw the administration  team who gave us a further understanding  on the program  of edoofar  .All in all what  am saying  is l had a great  time
4/3/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
4/3/24, 11:12 AM - +263 78 956 1557: I don't  know  but a lot l presume
4/3/24, 11:24 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789561557 there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
4/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 956 1557: Mmmm...the truth  is l left the venue  early  just  when  they  started  this
