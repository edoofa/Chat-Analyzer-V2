4/3/24, 12:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/3/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes let's start
4/3/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 341 4424: M done
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/3/24, 12:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/3/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes they are clear
4/3/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/3/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/3/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes m following
4/3/24, 12:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/3/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/3/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes m clear
4/3/24, 12:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/3/24, 12:45 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes let's start
4/3/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/3/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
4/3/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 341 4424: Yes let's start
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

6/3/24, 8:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Elitha.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday, as I was occupied with some work that required my immediate attention. However, I am available to connect with you now and thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
6/3/24, 8:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/3/24, 8:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/3/24, 8:05 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

12/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 341 4424: 2. Is such a thing as social structure that contains individual actions, or is social nothing more than a figment of our imaginations? Elaborate your answer. 



Social structure refers to the patterned relationships, roles, institutions and norms that shape and constrain individual behavior within a society. It provides a framework within which individuals interact, make decisions and carry out actions. Social structure is not merely a figment of our imaginations, it is a tangible and concrete aspects of society that influences and guides the behavior and actions of individuals. 

While society is a complex and dynamic entity composed of diverse individuals, groups and institutions, it is not simply a product of our imaginations. Society exists independently of individual perceptions and experiences and it's structures and systems have real impacts on our lives. Social structures such as institutions, organizations, laws and cultural norms play a crucial role in shaping our behaviors, choices and interactions with others. 

Individual actions within a society are influenced and constrained by social forces, power dynamics and historical context. However, individuals also have agency and the capacity to challenge, resist and reshape.
12/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 341 4424: 3. Please explain the relation between sociology and economics.

Sociology and economics are two social sciences that different aspects of society, but they are closely related disciplines that both study 
human behavior and societal institutions. Sociology focuses on the social aspects of human behavior which economics focuses on the economic aspects.

The two disciplines intersect in areas such as the study of consumer behavior, labour markets, income inequality and social stratification. Sociology provides insights into the social forces that shape economic behavior, such as cultural norms, social structures and power dynamics. Economics, in turn provides insights into the material
conditions that shape social behavior such as resource allocation, production and distribution.

Overall the relationship between sociology and economics is essential for understanding how individuals and societies interact economically and socially.
12/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 341 4424: 4. What is the role of institutions in society do they perform positive functions, or simple work in interests of the powerful and against the powerless?elaborate with exaple.

The role of institutions in society is complex and can vary depending on the specific institution and its context. While some institutions perform positive functions that contribute to the well-being and progress of the society, others may prioritize the interests of the powerful and perpetuate inequalities. 

Positive functions of institutions include providing essential services such as education, Healthcare and infrastructure. For example educational institutions play a crucial role in imparting knowledge and skills, empowering individuals and fostering social mobility. Similarly healthcare institutions provide and promote public health contribution to the overall well-being of the community. 

However, it is also true that some institutions may work in the interests of the powerful, potentially disadvantaging the powerless. This can be seen in instances where institutions reinforce systemic inequalities and maintain power imbalances. For example, certain legal and judicial institutions may exhibit bias and discrimination, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities and reinforcing social injustices. 

It is important to note that institutions can have both positive and negative aspects and their impact on society can be influenced by various factors, including governance, transparency and public accountability. Evaluating the role of institutions requires a careful analysis of their specific functions, structures and the broader social, economic and political context in which they operate.
12/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 78 341 4424: 5. Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with the examples about in groups and out groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.



Primary groups are small intimate and long - lasting social groups characterized by close relationships, emotional bonds and strong social ties. Examples of primary groups include families, close friends and small communities. In primary groups, members often share personal relationships, values and experiences and provide emotional support, belonging and intimacy to one another. 

Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal and less intimate social group characterized by formal task oriented relationships. Examples of secondary groups include classmates, colleagues at work and members of organizations. In secondary groups, members come together for specific purposes such as achieving goals, completing tasks or pursuing common interests. 
In-groups and out groups are subtypes of both primary and secondary groups that define boundaries and establish social identities with a group. In-groups are groups to which individuals belong and with which they identify often leading to feelings of belonging, loyalty and camaraderie. Out-groups, on the other hand are groups to which individuals do not belong or identify with. Out-groups may be based on factors such as competing, interests, conflicting values or social divisions.

Understanding the dynamics of primary and secondary groups as well as the concepts of in-groups and out groups helps sociologists analyze the various social interactions, relationships and dynamics that shape individual behavior, group cohesion and social identity within societies.
