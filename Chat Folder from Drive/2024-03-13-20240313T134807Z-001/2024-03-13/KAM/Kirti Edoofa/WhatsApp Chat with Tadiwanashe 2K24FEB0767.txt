This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
1/3/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Noted with thanks
1/3/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/3/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am ready ma'am we can start the discussion
1/3/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
1/3/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am through with the image ma'am
1/3/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/3/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
1/3/24, 7:45 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Clear ma'am
1/3/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/3/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
1/3/24, 7:49 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am following ma'am but on this stage l have a question so it means that if l get selected by over 5 universities l might get an opportunity to choose the one of my choice
1/3/24, 7:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789888134 Yes you are absolutely correct.
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well? <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am

1/3/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes we can ma'am
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

2/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Good morning everyone hope l find you all well
2/3/24, 10:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
2/3/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Great to hear that you are doing well ma'am .yes l have managed to go through the videos ma'am
2/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to know so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
2/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am let me share with you some of my understanding
2/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Actually looking to the videos that have been sent by ms kirti l have seen that the cofounders of the Edoofa schoolarships program are trying to explain more accurately on the aspects of the Edoofa program for example in one of the above videos there is an aspect of vision where they are fighting so much harder to enable the great archievement of students educational qualifications at most as there is an aspect of helping the student to be educated at a lower expense through the help of the scholarship percentage as one can also be able to get a fully funded schoolarships at the same time participating in EWYL program which will help to make students financially independent to sponsor their education
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/3/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Also l would like to add an aspect of the type of institution that works in hand with the Edoofa program as alluded in one of the video where the founders are giving a clear explaination of why they choose the Universities that they work with .one of the reasons being because of the universities educational pass rates as they look forward to create a comfortable and beneficial learning area to their proud Edoofians as the two have given an example that it is of no return to put their student on a non essential and unprofitable environment in terms of education as it may result in them being weakened
2/3/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Understood ma'am now the understanding is expanding
2/3/24, 10:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of NAME’S university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in NAME’S admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
2/3/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am we are on the same page ma'am
2/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 01:30 PM.
2/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

4/3/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Afternoon
4/3/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously may I know if you were able to complete the tasks by now?
4/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am okay ma'am yes l did managed to finish the task ma'am
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, please share the tasks with us here.
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am let me forward them to you
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference between Human Rights and Civil Rights.

Answer
Rights can be defined as one's claims which are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the state for example right to life , right to Education etc whereas Duties can be defined as something that one is expected or required to do for example one is expected to be patriotic and also to keep his or her surroundings clean to mention a few. Rights and duties also differ in the sense that rights have some certain restrictions as there are some factors like the law of label n slander, state of emergency, censorship etc while duties have no restrictions as the more one performs his duties, the more the state's benefits. 

Human Rights are those rights which one acquires by being alive whereas Civil Rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Furthermore, human Rights are the rights one have simply for being a human being for example right to food, right to health and right to protection and security etc while civil rights are contextual, meaning one is entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country. Also civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of the country while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied. Thus, it is clear that Human Rights and Civil Rights have their own differences.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 3. What is the difference between prosecutor and an attorney. 

Answer : A prosecutor is a legal officer who will either represent the federal or state  government during a legal proceeding where there are criminal charges whereas an attorney is an individual who acts on behalf of another as an agent or deputy. Also a prosecutor is responsible for prosecuting the crime that the accused are being tried for while the attorney will do the opposite as they should work to provide enough evidence to defend their client who has been accused to defend their client who has been accused of criminal charges. 

Furthermore, a prosecutor and an attorney also differs in their goals. This is because a prosecutor works with an aim to charge the accused with specific crime or multiple crimes that they have been accused of commuting as they show beyond a reasonable doubt that a client is guilty whereas an attorney works to defend their clients against criminal charges as the client will always be considered innocent until proven guilty. 

In conclusion, the above summerises on the differences of a prosecutor and an attorney as these two differ in their goals and also in whom they stand for in court.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Cooperate or Criminal and why?

Answer : I am most interested in pursuing Criminal law. This is because studying criminal law and justice can lead to various professional prospects by providing a comprehensive understanding of the legal system, criminal behavior and societal issues that influences crime. Also criminal law enables one to develop an aspect of critical thinking as one could think out of the box to defend a case and also one can get the knowledge on the legal consequences of crimes commited. 

Moreover, criminal law is also beneficial in the sense that it offers job stability as it is so essential to our society due to crimes being committed day by day. Also criminal law has an advantage in the sense that it opens a lot of doors for the career market afterwards and it is always something that will continue to have an open platform of employment Availability in future. 

Lastly, l am also interested in pursuing criminal law because being a criminal defense can bring some personal benefits as these are the benefits that encompass anything that promises to improve one's life for example career path of course.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with examples. 

Answer : I believe l have good communication skills and this can help me become a successful lawyer. This is because most lawyers benefit from good verbal and written communication skills to succeed as they must have for example strong oral communication skills, strong interpersonal skills which they will use when interacting with their clients, supervisors, teammates etc in doing their research. Therefore this goes inline with my skill of having good communication skills as l bacame successful in interacting with my teammates in Highschool thus my belief in my communication skills can make me a successful lawyer. 

Furthermore, l also believe l pay too much attention to details thereby this can make me a successful lawyer. This is because l give my whole attention to a discussion whenever there is one and this is an essential skill for any aspiring lawyer because it may help lawyers detect inconsistencies, missing information and even inaccuracies in legal papers. Thus l believe this skill can make me a successful lawyer.
4/3/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 988 8134: For question 1 the audio is uploading ma'am

4/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 988 8134: That was her reply on our pleading for the extension to 2025
4/3/24, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let me get back to you shortly.
4/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am

5/3/24, 8:50 PM - +263 77 342 2069: This message was deleted
6/3/24, 8:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tadiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you yesterday, as I was occupied with some work that required my immediate attention. However, I am available to connect with you now may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
6/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 532 1563: Morning ma'am
6/3/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Morning ma'am hw are you doing
6/3/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes we can connect now ma'am
6/3/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. Regarding the concern earlier, I was able to discuss the same with the team and stay assured that your year of intake was updated to 2025.
6/3/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Oooh okay ma'am thank you ma'am am grateful
6/3/24, 9:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 9:29 AM - +263 78 988 8134: The information is definitely accurate ma'am
6/3/24, 9:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/3/24, 9:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/3/24, 9:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/3/24, 9:37 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Ofcourse l am wondering ma'am can you elaborate more for me
6/3/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/3/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/3/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/3/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/3/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/3/24, 9:42 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/3/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 988 8134: It is ma'am because the reason that caused my intake to be extended was because of financial hardships which my family is facing so my family and l would wish for that plan to work ma'am
6/3/24, 9:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789888134 I completely understand, and before we move ahead I would like to know if you were able to connect with your EWYL mentor by now?
6/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 988 8134: We just joined the group as you asigned us ma'am so l am looking forward to hear from the mentor
6/3/24, 10:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Please share, this message in the group as well. *Dear Mentor, my name is Tadiwanashe Mushanagwenzi, and my EWYL group name is Tadiwanashe EWYL23E1316. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 08/03/2204 to commence the procedures.

6/3/24, 10:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to share the message to the EWYL group?
6/3/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am l did sent the message in the group ma'am and l am waiting for the mentors reply
6/3/24, 10:10 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us now move ahead with our discussion. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am l would like you to do that please
6/3/24, 10:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/3/24, 10:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/3/24, 10:14 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am l do
6/3/24, 10:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/3/24, 10:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/3/24, 10:16 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a 5-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Once you get a response from the EWYL mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms_Julia______ and he/she has scheduled my session for _Monday to Friday starting on the 8th of March the time being at 1:30pm_____
6/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am we will make sure it is put in practice ma'am
6/3/24, 10:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Julia. I appreciate you sharing the session date and time with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
6/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Thank you ma'am
6/3/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/3/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/3/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/3/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/3/24, 10:27 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am
6/3/24, 10:27 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
6/3/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes l would like
6/3/24, 10:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of *March15, 2024*.
6/3/24, 10:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
6/3/24, 10:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yeah l am actually Wondering abt that
6/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 988 8134: So does this mean that pertaining the 150 usd Enrollment fee that l had to pay before the 15th of March ...l am now not to pay the fee if l start saving with Edoofa right or the money just have to be paid
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are absolutely correct. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/3/24, 10:38 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/3/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 988 8134: I would say that this is actually beneficial because it reduces the burden of paying the fee at once as you will be saving per month which is less demanding than paying the whole fee without saving
6/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 988 8134: So ma'am if l discuss this with my parents and come up with a result of wanting to save with Edoofa would l wait paying the balance enrollment fee and start saving
6/3/24, 10:57 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better so that your query is also addressed. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/3/24, 10:57 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am
6/3/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/3/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/3/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/3/24, 11:01 AM - +263 78 988 8134: It sounds great 😊
6/3/24, 11:07 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
6/3/24, 11:08 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yeah l did understood only that on the Balance enrollment fee that l need clarity
6/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Should l move forward to pay the enrollment fee before the 15th or
6/3/24, 11:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, and once your 10th month is near regarding the payment of $150 it will be waived off and there will be no need to pay $150 during the 10th month since it will be waived off.
6/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Ooooh okay okay ma'am l now understand
6/3/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 988 8134: And also pertaining the months from March 2024 to August 2025 there is 17 months ma'am
6/3/24, 12:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
6/3/24, 12:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/3/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Actually due to work ties l believe l can get enough time to discuss the issue with my parents at night Ma'am
6/3/24, 12:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

12/3/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move ahead with our discussion today. I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
12/3/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Morning ma'am hey unfortunately l am not familiar with what slice con is ma'am
12/3/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
12/3/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/3/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/3/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Delight too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
12/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
12/3/24, 11:26 AM - +263 78 988 8134: I have gone through the Slice con information ma'am and l am grateful to have been added some knowledge in me about such an innovative conference
12/3/24, 11:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
12/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes yes ma'am concerning the Financial secure plan when we were discussing about the plan we figured that from this month March to next year August there is a distance of about 17 months which is not supleementum to your estimation of 20 months ma'am so how is that handled
12/3/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 988 8134: And also my parents were asking about how the money will be deposited and in who's account
12/3/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. As mentioned above earlier, for the first 10 months, you will be required to pay $150 every month which is mandatory if you follow the financial secure plan and from the 11th month till the 17th we will be assisting you to open the bank accounts. In those 11-17 months you will be saving the amount in your bank account for the visa process which will help you create a good bank statement as well during the time of your visa process as well. 

May I know if you are clear now?
12/3/24, 12:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We will be sharing the payment mode with you as well, stay assured.
12/3/24, 12:07 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am it is clear now

12/3/24, 12:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, let me help understand better. Even if you are eligible for a 100% scholarship, that scholarship will be on the tuition fee right, there are still going to be other expenses to cater to, also irrespective of the scholarship provided, you have a registration fee of $500-$1000 which needs to be cleared because unless and until you register yourself with the university first inorder to secure the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear so far?
