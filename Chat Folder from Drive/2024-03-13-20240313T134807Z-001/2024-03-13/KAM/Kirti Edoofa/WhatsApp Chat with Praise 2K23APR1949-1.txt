12/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Praise, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 12:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add praise to the group.

25/1/24, 6:41 AM - +263 77 272 1913: Will be available. Thank you
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Praise.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 272 1913: We are doing great. Thank you. We may continue
25/1/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
25/1/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
25/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 980 7849: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
25/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Noted
25/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now. I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
25/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)
25/1/24, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
25/1/24, 2:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
25/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Yes please
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech Computer Science Engineering, which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.

We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
25/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I'm not interested in computer science I like quantity surveying instead
25/1/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263719807849 thank you for letting me know that, however, I did not understand you well here are you saying you are not interested in pursuing Mechanical engineering as well since quantity surveying is completely different?
25/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I was interested in Mechanical engineering but my second option was quantity surveying
25/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263719807849 may I know if you were able to go through the messages above carefully because you are being offered Mechanical engineering only however, for the first year you will study Computer science engineering so that the void that you had in your A level of not having chemistry is being compensated by that.
25/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Oh! Let me revisit and read the messages carefully
25/1/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can.
25/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 71 980 7849: I have read and understood now. The idea is good I like it
25/1/24, 9:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from B.Tech Mechanical Engineering to Btech computer science engineering for the intake 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail once done please share the screenshot with us so that we can even update the university officials.
25/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 71 980 7849: Okay ma'am
25/1/24, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
