16/1/24, 9:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.
16/1/24, 9:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 9:36 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 73 714 9148: Okay how are you
16/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 73 714 9148: We started this year on a good note
16/1/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

16/1/24, 8:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. As per your application file, you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150. 

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
7/2/24, 8:44 PM - +263 73 714 9148: How are you l thought that 150 was going to be paid through the EWYL program
10/2/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Tinotenda, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission officer at Edoofa.*  Today while I was organizing my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
10/2/24, 8:04 PM - +263 73 714 9148: I am sorry l don't understand

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 73 714 9148: My experience at the meet and greet session was amazing,l learned a lot we were able to meet some of the edoofa administrators like  Mr Austin they were really friendly and also got a chance to meet the founders ,it was really amazing to be part of the edoofa family it felt like part of big lovely family who will take care of when we arrive in India and the parents got a chance to see the people who will be taking care of their children and the are assured that their children are in safe hands. I also learned about the SLICE CON which is a great chance to meet people who are really big and doing it in the world and we got a chance to hear their stories and how they made it.The experience was amazing thank you <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 1:54 PM - +263 73 714 9148: Afternoon how are you
29/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 73 714 9148: No we have no idea how many people attend the seminar
29/2/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 9:55 PM - +263 73 714 9148: Okay maybe it was because l didn't manage to attend that seminar because l had to attend an important family function
1/3/24, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings I hope you are doing well. 

I understand and that is quite alright. These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
1/3/24, 7:34 PM - +263 73 714 9148: Okay thank you very much
1/3/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
1/3/24, 7:37 PM - +263 73 714 9148: Yes l did have interactions with the other children when I attended the seminar
1/3/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
1/3/24, 8:11 PM - +263 73 714 9148: I really liked seeing some of our senior Edoofians who we saw last year, you could tell that they were enjoying themselves at the SLICE CON
2/3/24, 5:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your experience, I would have loved to continue with our discussion, however, since it is past our available hours for Saturday I will not be able to connect now so let us plan to reconnect on Monday. Have a blessed weekend.
12/3/24, 8:19 AM - +263 73 714 9148: Good morning
12/3/24, 10:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
12/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 73 714 9148: We are doing great thanks
12/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 73 714 9148: I would like to know about my ESAT
12/3/24, 10:10 AM - +263 73 714 9148: I would also like to know if l won't be receiving any offers letters
12/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 521 7510: Morning I'm Tinotenda' s mother my child shared you her results with you and you said you will reconnect with her to discuss the next steps in her academic journey but up to now you did not yet discuss anything.The other thing she wrote the Assessment test but she hasn't received the results as of today.The other thing she complained that I don't have a mentor until now she doesn't have one is there any reason for that
12/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263775217510 thank you for sharing your concerns, I understand where you are coming from let me help you understand one by one, after asking for Tinotenda's result the EWYL team got occupied with the Africa trip and the response was really overwhelming. However, I was able to connect with the EWYL team and they informed me that there has been no response in the EWYL group from your side,  may I know why is that so?
12/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 73 714 9148: Okay but when l started the counseling sessions l was to  pay $150  and the rest l will pay through the EWYL program of which l did pay the $150 so l have been doing my EWYL program and I have stopped because l am now confused that did l earn anything or the program doesn't work that way
12/3/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe you are confused here, the fee that you are talking about is the edoofa enrollment fee which is $350 which you paid to enroll with us, so that you can utilize the benefits and services we provide to you and if you are keen to know more about your credits you can directly ask your EWYL mentor about the same, may I know if you ever tried asking your credits from your mentor?
12/3/24, 10:46 AM - +263 73 714 9148: So the registration fee is the one l am supposed to pay ,okay now I understand
12/3/24, 10:46 AM - +263 73 714 9148: About my mentor l don't have any mentor at the moment
12/3/24, 10:47 AM - +263 73 714 9148: I would also like to know some of your partner universities
12/3/24, 10:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct.
12/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 73 714 9148: I was confused thank you for helping me with that
12/3/24, 10:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263737149148 my point here is if you have not responded to the group how will you be able to know if your new mentor is allotted or not they have been reaching out to you.
12/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 73 714 9148: Okay l understand
12/3/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Since we are connected with 250+ universities it will be not possible for me to provide you with a list of universities however, I can let you know a few of the best universities.
