11/3/24, 2:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (March 19th) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.

11/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
11/3/24, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Ricaldo 2K24FEB1756)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
11/3/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Ricaldo EWYL23E1346)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
11/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 954 8624: Oky yes I'm clear
11/3/24, 2:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
11/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 954 8624: Oky first of all the willingness of Edoofa has motivated me in archiving my career goals and with the EWYL program thus the most thing that impressed me because to tell the truth it was going to be a big challenge to us in paying the fees so by introducing the EWYL program makes it easier to face these financial challenges as it plays a big role in paying my school fees
11/3/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience. I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
