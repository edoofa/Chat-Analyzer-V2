12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - +260 96 2476932: That's very interesting. 
As a family all is well and we hope it'll be through out the year.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 8:07 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you for sharing, I really appreciate it and I'm definitely excited to experience such events when and if I come to India.
12/1/24, 9:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
13/1/24, 2:09 AM - +260 96 2476932: Okay great. Looking forward to it.
13/1/24, 9:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning parents and Walusungu,

I trust this message finds you well. With regard to our conversation previously I wanted to follow up and inquire if you're currently available to connect with us. This would allow us to continue our discussion as we had originally planned
13/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
13/1/24, 1:38 PM - +260 96 2476932: I hope to connect with you on Monday as well.
25/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
26/1/24, 12:50 PM - +260 96 2476932: We have been okay thank you. 
I'm glad you are better
26/1/24, 12:50 PM - +260 96 2476932: I'm ready to resume our interactions too
26/1/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well and thank you for your concern. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:57 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you so much
26/1/24, 12:57 PM - +260 96 2476932: Enjoy your celebration
26/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you for your wishes. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
26/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your  results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
26/1/24, 1:02 PM - +260 96 2476932: Okay no problem
26/1/24, 1:03 PM - +260 96 2476932: G12 180502180003 BANDA WALUSUNGU: ENG.-1, CVCEDU-1, R.E.-6, MATHS-1, ADDM-2, PHYS-2, CHEM-3, BIOL-1 Result:SCHOOL CERTIFICATE
26/1/24, 1:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 thank you for sharing that, however, could you please share the picture of the result since the document would be required for your scholarship application.
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +260 96 2476932: I'd have to go to school to get the document.
The results are sent via text message
26/1/24, 1:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 I understand that however, most of my students from Zambia have shared the document with us, so may I know by when will you be able to collect the document from the school?
26/1/24, 1:09 PM - +260 96 2476932: When I visit the school which is not anytime soon.
I'm currently far from the school but I'll make time
26/1/24, 1:20 PM - +260 96 1590476: Good afternoon, kirt. Maybe explain the kind of documents because these results have barely been announced 4 hours ago, and I doubt if the results are in schools yet.
26/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260961590476 there might be confusion since some students were able to share their results with me, might be they appeared last year and hence it was possible for them, however, may I know by when you be able to collect the grade 12 result for Walusungu?
26/1/24, 2:35 PM - +260 96 2476932: We aren't sure but we'll try our best
26/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 96 1590476: I will be in touch with the school and get back to you ASAP
26/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260961590476  surely I will be waiting for your response.
26/1/24, 2:48 PM - +260 96 1590476: Excellent
2/2/24, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, I will be able to connect with you now onwards.
4/2/24, 7:08 PM - +260 96 2476932: There is no problem.
4/2/24, 7:08 PM - +260 96 2476932: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
5/2/24, 2:35 PM - +260 96 2476932: Good afternoon. 
I hope you are well too. 
Thank you so much and we shall wait.
5/2/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
5/2/24, 10:12 PM - +260 96 2476932: I can connect with you tomorrow at 10
5/2/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 since our available hours are from 12:30 pm to 08:30 pm, connecting with you at 10:00 am will not be possible for me.
5/2/24, 10:14 PM - +260 96 2476932: Then I can connect with you at 1:00 pm
5/2/24, 10:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. Have a blessed night ahead.
5/2/24, 10:20 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you and same
6/2/24, 1:45 PM - +260 96 2476932: Good afternoon
6/2/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you at 01:00 pm, I was occupied in a meeting however, we can connect now, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
6/2/24, 2:28 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we can connect
6/2/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 2:39 PM - +260 96 2476932: I do not recall talking about the registration process. Did you discuss it with me or my parents?
6/2/24, 2:41 PM - +260 96 2476932: This I should believe is what we discussed, right?
6/2/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260962476932 this was discussed with your parents because during July you were not available to connect.
6/2/24, 3:02 PM - +260 96 2476932: Oh okay then you can try to fill me in.
6/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
6/2/24, 3:05 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you so much.
Yes you may proceed
6/2/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
6/2/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
6/2/24, 3:10 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we are clear. Go on.
6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:
6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
6/2/24, 3:44 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we are clear
6/2/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
6/2/24, 4:21 PM - +260 96 2476932: Let me take time to absorb the information and then if I have any questions I'll get back to you. Thank you.
6/2/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
6/2/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
6/2/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 4:28 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes we are excited.
6/2/24, 4:30 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you for sharing and I hope everything works out for the greater good.
6/2/24, 4:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
6/2/24, 4:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
6/2/24, 4:50 PM - +260 96 2476932: I'm very eager to know the news
6/2/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $$750.
6/2/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
6/2/24, 5:06 PM - +260 96 2476932: I've only heard of the solution now
6/2/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
6/2/24, 6:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
6/2/24, 9:23 PM - +260 96 2476932: I've followed the details so far. Thank you.
6/2/24, 9:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
6/2/24, 9:26 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes I'm excited. Why wouldn't I be?
6/2/24, 9:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
6/2/24, 9:31 PM - +260 96 2476932: Okay thank you for everything and have a blessed night.
16/2/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/2/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/2/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
16/2/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/2/24, 7:09 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you for sharing this important update. We are very grateful. 
I have gone through the letter and I'm looking forward to discussing it with you tomorrow. 
10:00 AM is alright. 

Thank you so much once again and I'll go through the letter thoroughly so that we can discuss it tomorrow.
17/2/24, 9:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Walusungu,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/2/24, 9:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/2/24, 3:56 PM - +260 96 2476932: I apologize for my failure to connect with you at 10.
However I'd like to know if we can connect now? 
If not then it's okay. Monday is fine and you can decide the time.


I'd like to ask why it's just psychology only, instead of cognitive psychology.
I'd also like that the total amount needed to make this possible be communicated, from the fees to the flight plan and the rest of the necessary information.
17/2/24, 3:56 PM - +260 96 2476932: Thank you once again.
17/2/24, 4:34 PM - +260 96 6952326: Considering that Walusungu just completed her O levels, does it mean that she is not eligible for this acceptance letter? <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your concerns, since we were unable to continue with our discussion earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can understand the letter better?

I hope everything is now well with your family.
Maybe we can connect tomorrow according to a time of your choosing?
7/3/24, 8:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Walusungu.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded yesterday, it was past our available hours so we could not get back to you, however, we can connect now. Thank you for asking, my family is now doing better. Certainly, we can connect today may I know if 3:00 pm CAT works fine for you?
7/3/24, 9:18 AM - +260 96 2476932: Good morning.
We are all fine thank you.
I'm glad to hear your family is doing better.
If you are available right now we can connect but if you are not 3:00 pm CAT is alright.
7/3/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine as well. Yes please, if you are available right now we can connect now.
7/3/24, 2:41 PM - +260 96 2476932: No problem. Let's get into it.
7/3/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
7/3/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
7/3/24, 2:46 PM - +260 96 2476932: We may continue
7/3/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
7/3/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
7/3/24, 2:58 PM - +260 96 2476932: 1. 900 USD
2. 3 years (6 semesters)
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
7/3/24, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
7/3/24, 3:11 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes it does
7/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
7/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
7/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
7/3/24, 3:13 PM - +260 96 2476932: Okay.
This is food for thought.
7/3/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
7/3/24, 3:31 PM - +260 96 2476932: Yes it does thank you.
7/3/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
7/3/24, 3:57 PM - +260 96 2476932: I am clear. We can move forward
7/3/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
7/3/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 01st 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
7/3/24, 4:03 PM - +260 96 6952326: Following 👂🏾👂🏾though busy
7/3/24, 4:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
7/3/24, 4:28 PM - +260 96 6952326: Now that the deadline has passed and it was not of our own making , we were supposed to discuss the same offer letter then you had to hold due to circumstances beyond your control.
So for us it's like we have received the offer letter today, l was wondering if there's a chance of extension 🤔
7/3/24, 4:37 PM - +260 96 1590476: ?????
11/3/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was busy discussing your case with the academic board regarding the message you shared. Now I understand that my absence must have made you feel unheard, however, stay assured I was absent for you only. I was indeed able to have a discussion with the board about the issue you presented. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/3/24, 3:24 PM - +260 96 1590476: Good afternoon. 
Indeed, we got so worried that maybe our chance had been lost. We will appreciate feedback, please.
11/3/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand however, I was out there discussing about your case only. Let me help you with this. This $750 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$375 before the 20th of March, 2024* 

2. A subsequent payment of *$375  before the 20th of April, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline).
11/3/24, 4:22 PM - +260 96 1590476: Noted
11/3/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account
11/3/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 10% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
11/3/24, 4:45 PM - +260 96 1590476: It sounds very good, actually
12/3/24, 12:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

12/3/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:
