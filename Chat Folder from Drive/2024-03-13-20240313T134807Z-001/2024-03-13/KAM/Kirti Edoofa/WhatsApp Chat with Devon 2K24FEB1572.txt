12/3/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Devon 2K24FEB1572)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
12/3/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Devon EWYL23E1355)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
12/3/24, 1:04 PM - +27 84 233 0114: Thats clear
12/3/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring him access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
12/3/24, 1:13 PM - +27 84 233 0114: I was inspired by the Earn while you earn program but only if Devon puts more hard work in it so that the fees will be more less for us(if i may use the word less).Also that the fees is about $6000-$8000 per year without scholarship and which will be much less with the scholarship for up to 60%-100%.Finding a job for him as well after the graduation which means Edoofa will be still assisting util the end
12/3/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience.  It is our goal to provide every student with affordable education and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
