15/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns with us?
15/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 71 489 5439: Is there any university that has replied as of now, or you are still waiting for the offer letters
15/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 489 5439: I'm also excited to inform that Zimsec Alevel results were just released last week
15/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 280 1613: The A'Level examinations results are now out and we want to know if we still have the chances to receive offer letters from universities.
15/1/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
15/1/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
15/1/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We are still waiting for the response.

17/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 280 1613: May I know if we are still working together. Should we continue having hope that we will get a university with you?
17/1/24, 11:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Yes please, we are still in process and as I mentioned above we are waiting for updates since the university is closed today once we get an update we will notify you however, the university officials from LPU reached out to us yesterday and informed us that did connect with an agent to get the letter from LPU process, may I know if that is correct?
17/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 280 1613: No please may you continue as you are the one who applied on Takunda 's behalf. That agent was trying to get us from you using the overzealous of the child.
17/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Make everything correct with LPU please
17/1/24, 11:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please @263772801613. However, please understand we are here to assist you only and if the process is taking time please understand we wish to ensure that your process is being carried out smoothly. I understand that being a parent where you are coming from but I would appreciate it if you keep faith in us as well, we also want the same as what you desire for Takunda.

17/1/24, 10:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/1/24, 10:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

18/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Hello, team Edoofa!!!
24/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 280 1613: It was a bad week. However I don't think we qualify to be in Edoofa.
24/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry to hear about your bad week, may I know what happened and what makes you think that you do not qualify to be with us?
24/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Your university charges are not of our level. We can't afford $3000 every year without adding food and accommodation.
24/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 280 1613: It was bad cause I am regretting the time, effort and some money I wasted on Edoofa project. Sorry to mention this.
25/1/24, 9:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier today I had an emergency visit to my doctor regarding my ENT infection, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
26/1/24, 6:39 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Do you think Edoofa will be of any help to us?
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I extend my heartfelt greetings to you and your loved ones. Today marks a significant moment in our nation's history, a day when we commemorate the enactment of our Constitution and celebrate the enduring spirit of democracy and unity that defines us as a country.
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you are facing some issues, however, you know despite so many challenges students can complete their admission and reserve their seats with the university and for that, I would like to have a detailed discussion with you so that I can have a better understanding of your challenges so may I know what is a convenient time for you to connect with us?
26/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We can talk now
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents Takunda from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
26/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. Could you please let me know the exact challenges that you are facing?
26/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We can not afford to pay $1500 every April and $1500 every November of each year. Further more we don't know how much shall be accommodation and food, we need to get visa fees and air ticket. While on the other hand we have other children who should go to school. Our income is little
26/1/24, 5:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772801613 I completely understand what you are trying to say here and that is the main reason we recommended MVN University to you in the first place because our counseling team shared insights about your requirement with us that you mentioned during the counseling session and that is the reason with careful consideration our admission teams and the board had recommended higher quantum of scholarship to you where accommodation was fully covered. LPU is one of the best universities in India and that is the reason it is even on the expensive side as well.
26/1/24, 5:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I would still suggest you have a better understanding of the letter first so may I know if you will be available to connect with us today at 06:00 pm CAT to understand the letter in detail?
26/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We wish to work on scholarship of  something like 80% tuition, 100% accommodation and 100% food plan.
27/1/24, 6:38 AM - +263 77 280 1613: I'm sorry I was off line. If you are comfortable,let's talk now
27/1/24, 6:38 AM - +263 77 280 1613: One of the most saddening thing is the misfortune that befall us in mid December 2023. All our income and expected gains got eroded. Therefore we can not afford higher admission fee and higher per annum fees
1/2/24, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not connecting in the past few days, I have been currently dealing with an unexpected family emergency and have taken some time off to provide support to my loved ones during this challenging time and that is why I have not been able to get back to you, however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
1/2/24, 10:12 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you, let's try to connect around 4pm.
2/2/24, 6:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
2/2/24, 6:45 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Yes let's talk
2/2/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, now I was able to go through the challenge you shared above, and for me to understand this challenge could you please help me understand what particular loss you faced in December 2023 that lead to your expected gains got eroded?
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: My contract with another company was terminated, and I was expecting to use the funds towards Takunda
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Now tell me how will the accommodation and food be according to the offer letter.
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 280 1613: So with the scholarship balance versus my family income, it will be difficult to afford the payments unless you bring in other incentives like rising the scholarship percentage on tution, accommodation and food.
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 395 9454: Sorry mam was off line tomorrow will be at church so if possible lets connect on Monday
2/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 395 9454: Good evening mam Kirti
2/2/24, 9:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your exact challenges, I have taken note of your challenges and will discuss them in detail tomorrow. I would love to continue with our discussion however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
2/2/24, 11:39 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We will be at church tomorrow during the day and can connect around 6pm
3/2/24, 8:04 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded, it was past our available hours hence I could not get back to you. I completely understand that you must be occupied with the church today. However, I will not be available to connect today at 06:00 pm since our available hours for today are from 08:00 am to 01:30 pm only,
3/2/24, 10:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning parents and Takunda,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
5/2/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Takunda

I hope this message finds you well. I'm circling back regarding the earlier message I shared. While I was anticipating a response, it appears that my messages might not have reached you.

Hence, I'm reaching out today to inquire if you had the opportunity to review my previous message and to confirm if our communication is still ongoing.
5/2/24, 7:04 PM - +263 77 280 1613: How are you, let talk now or tomorrow 4pm
5/2/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely whatever suits you the better, may I know what is more preferable for you?
5/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Tomorrow 4pm   I will be having enough time
5/2/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 04:00 pm. I am looking forward to connecting with you. Have a blessed night ahead.
5/2/24, 7:25 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank
6/2/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Hello
8/2/24, 12:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Takunda,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above, since we were not able to connect and continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
8/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Let's talk
8/2/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 280 1613: But do you have anything to offer me or we are just wasting time
8/2/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you at that time, I was occupied in a meeting as it's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
8/2/24, 7:06 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Okay
8/2/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Returning to our conversation, as I mentioned earlier, LPU stands out as one of the top universities in India. However, it was your preference to receive an offer letter from LPU. I've been trying to convey this information for quite some time. The primary reason we initially suggested MVN University to you was based on the insights shared by our counseling team regarding your specific requirements mentioned during the counseling session. This careful consideration by our admission teams and the board led to the recommendation of a higher scholarship amount for you, covering accommodation expenses entirely.
8/2/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Nevertheless, it's crucial to recognize that you are seeking an international scholarship. Taking into account the specialized nature of Takunda's course, we exerted significant effort to secure the offer letter from MVN University. They have extended a 75% scholarship, coupled with a complete sponsorship for accommodation. I might be struggling to grasp your viewpoint on the workings of a scholarship. Could you kindly enlighten me on your thoughts regarding this matter?
8/2/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Do you accept that MVN is not internationally recognized, do you accept that it's difficult to accept the first offer when you were told that we applied to many universities, so knowing that a lot is to come make someone wish to see them all and make a choice.
8/2/24, 7:26 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Anyway do you have any wayforward for us, so that we closed this issue with positive hope or with the negative picture of Edoofa.
8/2/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I respectfully disagree with your perspective. The completion of Takunda's higher education at MVN University leads to an internationally recognized degree. Our intention is not to present Edoofa in a positive or negative light; rather, we aim to provide understanding. It's important to note that Pharmacy is a niche field, and seeking an 80% scholarship with 100% sponsorship for accommodation and food might not be feasible to attain all at once. MVN University's degree holds international recognition and is accredited by the Pharma Council of India.
8/2/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, if you still find it challenging to comprehend the offered benefits, I recommend having a one-on-one discussion with Ms. Vilsha, who will be present during the meet-and-greet in Harare. This will allow you to express your concerns directly and receive personalized clarification.
8/2/24, 7:53 PM - +263 77 280 1613: If there is nothing for our level then it's okay.
8/2/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We don't need to correct what has passed but to have the wayforward. If no wayforward then nothing can I do for we are poor, now poorer than the time we started the applications
10/2/24, 11:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to update you that our team of experts will be visiting *Martin Luther King Jnr School, Warren Park-1, Harare, on the 17th of February 2024* to assist bright students like yourself in career guidance and university admission procedures.

12/2/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Sure you know my situation right now so tell me the advantages of attending this summit

12/2/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand what you are saying, however, the benefits are stated right here, apart from this what I believe is the best would be the one one-on-one discussion where you can convey your challenges directly to the team and get the solutions instantly.

26/2/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Takunda.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, I was unable to connect with you.
26/2/24, 6:59 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Hello, my condolences sure
26/2/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding your query inquired above. The team has not provided us with any updates yet, however, please do not worry I am sure they will be sharing updates with us tomorrow.

28/2/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 489 5439: We had a great time together with the team meeting them face to face was awo some
Thank you madam kirti
Also met madam vilsha and others
29/2/24, 1:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 71 489 5439: No
I have no idea ma'am
29/2/24, 2:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714895439, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 489 5439: Guess there is a mistake wt the records
I met them personally
29/2/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714895439 I just have a discussion with Ms. Vilsha and she mentioned that she indeed met you and she also has the records of the discussion and I believe she has discussed a plan with you regarding the registration fee.
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - +263 71 489 5439: I would like to thank you sir and ma'am for the counseling yu gave me yesterday
I have been thinking about it yesterday
I would like to take MVN for August this year
But I kindly request for your assistance, according to our situation we presented to you, is there any problem we pay the $1000 registration fee  at once by starting of July/end June so that I then receive the acceptance letter and prepare for the visa that early July
1/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 71 489 5439: I sent that message to sir abnav after the session in Harare
And that was my final proposal but he hasn't replied my messages till today ma'am kirti
1/3/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know about the message you shared, I completely understand that you wish to start with your visa process early, however, please understand that to start with your visa process early you will need to register yourself with the university first and reserve your seat with the university the team has worked really hard for you to get your seat reserved.
1/3/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that $1000 at once is a huge amount, however, we can always have a discussion with the board about a flexible payment plan, so please let me know if you wish to explore the same?
1/3/24, 7:56 PM - +263 71 489 5439: Yes to start the visa processing I need to regester myself wt the university
That is wat I ws proposing we pay the 1000 early July or end June so that I then process the visa... So I was pleading you adhere to my request maam
1/3/24, 8:00 PM - +263 71 489 5439: Becz to pay it in portions for now it's difficult
We are hardly getting something to eat
My father lost his job last year, guess yu that was shared in this group and my mother is trying to keep my two siblings at School and also have something to eat in the house so it's a tough situation we are in
We are trying to speak with our relatives to help with the registration payment and we are still in process
Hence I'm request you hear my plea and support me
6/3/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Takunda.

I trust this message finds you well. I apologize for not reaching out earlier; urgent work demanded my immediate attention. I am now available to connect with you.

I comprehend your concerns, Takunda. However, it's crucial to acknowledge and abide by the university's guidelines. Fairness to all students is a priority, and the university cannot indefinitely hold a seat for you until June or July.
6/3/24, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding your conversation with Ms. Vilsha, I believe she effectively communicated how we can assist you with a flexible payment plan. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated otherwise If you have made up your mind that you will wait till June or July regarding your admission I am not sure how can I assist you here, because the course you have chosen is a niche course, plus by the time you wish to complete your registration process is the time when students are almost even done with their visa process, so I do not understand how will you be able to reserve your seat by that time when almost all the seats will be filled before that and that is the main reason of my concern and hence all I can do is help you understand that by time reserving a seat will be very difficult since seats for Pharmacy are limited however, it is your wish if you wish to follow my advise here.
6/3/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you for the advise and support, let's work towards good as soon as possible
6/3/24, 6:34 PM - +263 77 395 9454: Thus true thank you for the advice
6/3/24, 8:57 PM - +263 77 280 1613: We will start the payment process this month for MVN so update us on how to do it.
If possible resend us the offer letter with the banking details etc .
8/3/24, 8:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with some work. Thank you for letting me know that, I am really glad to know that you are moving forward with Takunda's higher education may I know if you will be available to connect with us today at 03:00 pm?
8/3/24, 8:20 AM - +263 77 280 1613: If network permits it's okay
8/3/24, 8:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, we can continue if you are available right now as well.
8/3/24, 8:35 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Yes lets continue
8/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us first discuss the financial modes which you can use to make your deposit. 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
8/3/24, 8:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
8/3/24, 8:51 AM - +263 77 280 1613: I'm in Bulawayo, can we use Mr Shohwi account
8/3/24, 8:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can. However, If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
8/3/24, 8:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC
Branch: Harare
Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004
Swift Code: FBCPZWHA
Sort Code: 8127
8/3/24, 8:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
8/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Provide the account details for Mr Shorwi
8/3/24, 9:00 AM - +263 77 280 1613: On this one can I deposit cash while in Bulawayo?
8/3/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 280 1613: I am sure we will use Mr Shorwi account and we will be depositing $200 every month. Of it happens that I get a better amount then I will deposit more.
8/3/24, 9:45 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you can just make sure that the branch name for Mr. Rajan will be Harare.
8/3/24, 9:45 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
8/3/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you madam
8/3/24, 10:09 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know by when are you planning to make the deposit towards the registration fee so that we can update the university as well?
8/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 280 1613: On Monday 11 March  2023
8/3/24, 10:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you letting me know that, could you also let me know how much amount will you be depositing on the 11th of march?
8/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 280 1613: $200
8/3/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 280 1613: We will be depositing $200 per month as we discussed with Ms Vilsha. Then I we happen to get more cash, we can as well deposit more until we finish the $2500 per year. I hope in few months to come we will be get better earnings.
8/3/24, 10:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright, please. I shall update the university officials about the same. As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
8/3/24, 11:36 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you. Remember the university is MVN
8/3/24, 11:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
8/3/24, 11:38 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you
12/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 280 1613: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 280 1613: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
12/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 280 1613: Thank you
