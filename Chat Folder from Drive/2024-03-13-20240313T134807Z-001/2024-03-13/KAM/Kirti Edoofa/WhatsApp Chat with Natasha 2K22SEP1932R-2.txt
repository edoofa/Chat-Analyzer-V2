I am *Mr. Shivjeet, and I serve as the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I wanted to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. 

I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
8/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natasha,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
16/1/24, 7:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 78 966 8658: Good evening sir
17/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 966 8658: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 9:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha.

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 9:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 78 966 8658: Noted with thanks
22/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day Natasha , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.
22/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 396 3440: I am unable to understand which University application registration l failed to complete <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I've noticed that the process has been moving at a slower pace, and it seems there might have been some delays on your end. Other students who reserved seats alongside you have already secured spots at universities. I'm here personally to expedite the process, ensuring you have ample time for proper planning.
23/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: To confirm our records: you've chosen Bachelor of Business administartion for your higher education, and I understand you plan to arrive in India by August 2024. Is that correct?
23/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes thats correct Sir
23/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted
23/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes l recall the fee but when where the payment is done l wasn't informed
23/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
23/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 396 3440: No l understand Sir
23/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes sir it's clear
23/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/1/24, 3:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
23/1/24, 3:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Okay Noted Sir
23/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
23/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Am pleased Sir
23/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
23/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 396 3440: That's very convenient
23/1/24, 8:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:15 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Okay Sir thank you
24/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 396 3440: Good morning Sir
24/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/1/24, 10:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: For example, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 77 396 3440: No it's clear
24/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 396 3440: I don't have any questions
24/1/24, 3:03 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
24/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 396 3440: Yes am excited
24/1/24, 3:20 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

25/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 77 396 3440: Good morning Sir
25/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

12/3/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.

12/3/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
12/3/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 966 8658: Yes
12/3/24, 4:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
12/3/24, 4:09 PM - +263 78 966 8658: Thank you

This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
