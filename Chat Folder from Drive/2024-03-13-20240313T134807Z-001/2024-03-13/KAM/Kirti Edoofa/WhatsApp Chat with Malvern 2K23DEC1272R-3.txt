27/12/23, 4:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:40 PM - +27 84 789 5012: We can proceed
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:47 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I have gone through the picture, we can continue
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Clear!!
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 5:12 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Following, about the 1 hour session, is it a video call or just chatting
27/12/23, 5:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27847895012 it will be through texts, on WhatsApp please do not worry.
27/12/23, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Understood
27/12/23, 5:19 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Sounds good, clear
27/12/23, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 5:24 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Let's do it
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - +27 84 789 5012: M ready
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
27/12/23, 6:47 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Okay thank you I have received all the videos and by the time I finish watching all of them l will not be able to respond because I am at internet cafe and it closes at 7 which is soon so we can reschedule for tomorrow if that's okay
27/12/23, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, we can connect tomorrow, it is alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I hope by that time you will be able to go through the videos

28/12/23, 12:04 AM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you
28/12/23, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Malvern,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:25 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Greetings to you Ms Kirti, I am having a marvelous day, how are you.
28/12/23, 1:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and I am glad to know that you are having a great day. May I know if you were able to go through the videos?

28/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Well, from the first video which was the message for enrollled students, the 2 emphasized points which I picked were to follow every instruction and being open minded. the second video was about the Edoofa`s  vision for us as students that it recognizes everyone and that only helps a lot for someone to reach his/her goals. in addition to the3rd video which was about the colleges and universities, they emphasized that one should be able to interact with the cuniversity and also follow given instructions, hard working to invest. the preparation for interactive sessions with schools was mentioned in the last video as students were encouraged to explain their ambitions, visions and motivations why they enroll into the Edoofa program. This is just a few that I picked
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 1:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/12/23, 2:00 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you for fully explaining that to me, I am enlightened.
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
28/12/23, 2:02 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Yes, we are
28/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you so much
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - +27 84 789 5012: We appreciate
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a master's degree in the course Maters of Arts in Political Science for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Wonderful
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Yes, that's correct
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I am available
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Yes, that's correct
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 2:34 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Yes, they explained it to me
29/12/23, 2:34 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Following
29/12/23, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 4:02 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Yes we are
29/12/23, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 4:43 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I have noted the example
29/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 4:46 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Its a lot to take in but okay, I am following
29/12/23, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27847895012 please let me know what is it that you are not able to understand. I am more than happy to help you?
29/12/23, 4:49 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I understand everything, we can move on
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Following
29/12/23, 5:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 5:19 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Just for clarification, the registration fee is paid within two weeks after the acceptance letter and also the initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of my arrival in India, so my question is how long does it take for me to be at the university after acceptance ;etter offered?
29/12/23, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, the academic intake in India commences in August every year.
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Alright alright
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Malvern,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
2/1/24, 1:53 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Good afternoon Ms Kirti, thank you for reaching out and hope you had a happy new year as well. 

Sure we can continue with our conversation
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and indeed my new year was happy as well. I am glad to know that we can connect now. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - +27 84 789 5012: That's is wonderful, much appreciated
2/1/24, 2:17 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I strongly believe that together we can
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
2/1/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
2/1/24, 2:54 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Interesting, we can proceed
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level and bachelors results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 3:33 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Wow, that is great news. its an amazing opportunity, thank you
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 3:39 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I think that is great, however I did not understand how it works
2/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27847895012 Let me help you understand in the most layman's terms as possible. Basically, the benefit you will get it that you can pay the same fees for your course as were charged last year, even though the fees might go up this year. It's like getting last year's price in this year's market. Each year, universities usually increase their fees. They could go up by 20% to 30% based on what's happened in the past. That's a big jump and can make education more expensive for you.
2/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you're part of this program, you get to pay the fees that were set for the academic year of 2023, even though you'll be starting in 2024. It’s like a special offer where you don’t have to pay more even if the prices go up for everyone else. No matter if the university decides to increase the fees for new students in 2024, your fees will stay the same as they were in 2023. This helps you save money and plan your finances better.

May I know if you understand better now?
2/1/24, 3:52 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Wonderful, understood
2/1/24, 3:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 3:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 3:54 PM - +27 84 789 5012: this one is clear
2/1/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 3:56 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Noted maam
2/1/24, 3:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +27 84 789 5012: I understand that it has been such a long journey and a lot of effort put in just to help me understand how things work. I appreciate and admire all the efforts. Personally, I have grasped all the concepts and how the admission process works, however it is not clear with me considering how much exactly that is required for me to register since all your messages were pointing out that I should be able to pay this registration fee in less than few weeks. It could be difficult for more to raise such amounts in a short period, I don't know if I have made out my point and if it is appropriate to say.
2/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27847895012 thank you for sharing your concern with me, let me help you understand. The amount of the registration fee that you need to prepare ranges from $500 to $1000, and as per the example above we encourage you to prepare for the higher amount so that if the amount is extra it can used further in your process. And let me tell you that after the endowment program, you have been given a $100 grant making your registration fee $900 which can be paid in two installments of $450 each.  What we have mentioned is the ideal timeline given by the university however, each and every university has its own deadline period so please do not worry about that, if you face any challenges all I would encourage you to do is engage with a transparent discussion with us.

I hope we are clear now?
2/1/24, 4:19 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Its noted.
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/1/24, 4:32 PM - +27 84 789 5012: ohh I am so excited
2/1/24, 5:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
2/1/24, 5:09 PM - +27 84 789 5012: Thank you, its been a pleasure, enjoy the rest of the day as well and goodnight.
17/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. As I was organizing my day today I was going through Malvern's file and I wanted to update you that we are expecting great news for Malvern's university application process when I wanted to reach out and share this message however, I noticed that the number *+27 84 789 5012* is no longer part of our group.

Please do let us know, as we are here to assist you in any way we can. @263785011506 @263713524889.

17/1/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is alright, please. I was just concerned so I thought asking you about the same will be the best.
20/1/24, 10:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Malvern ,

20/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 352 4889: Wonderful news,thank you so much
24/1/24, 1:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvern,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 352 4889: The past week has been well,thank God you are recovering well.

24/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 71 352 4889: I will be available,am sure I will be home by that time as I am traveling now
24/1/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Greetings Ms Kirti, my sincere apologies for not attending any sessions lately but i am available now. I just went through all the messages and i am glad and thankful for the opportunity the PDM university that has offered me.
25/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. It is alright, please. I completely understand and we can connect today at 06:00 pm CAT to continue with our discussion.
25/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Its okay i will be available
25/1/24, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Yes maam
25/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
25/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
25/1/24, 7:19 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Yes we can proceed
25/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
25/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
25/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 501 1506: 1. 1305 USD
2. 2 years
3.  750 USD
25/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1305, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2552. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
25/1/24, 7:44 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Its clear
25/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
25/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
25/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
25/1/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2305 ($1305 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
25/1/24, 8:04 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Following
25/1/24, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
25/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 78 501 1506: That sounds good,😊😊
25/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2305, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
25/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Interesting
25/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2305. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2305 - $1000 = $1305, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
25/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
25/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Thank you Ms Kirti, it helps
25/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once you arrive in India will be as follows: <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1305 - $750 = $555, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1305 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2555. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2555 - $750 = $1805. This amount can be paid in two installments of $902 and $903, spaced 6 months apart.
25/1/24, 8:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
25/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Noted
25/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as 2nd February 2024.
25/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $100 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
25/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Sure, i was about to ask lol
25/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $325 before the first deadline date of February 2nd, 2024 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $325 before the second deadline date of March 2nd, 2024 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before February 2nd 2024

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Its clear maam
25/1/24, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, we can also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/1/24, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Chiredzi
25/1/24, 9:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
25/1/24, 9:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
25/1/24, 9:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
25/1/24, 10:00 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Okay thank you Ms Kirti, i will hear if my parents agree with the same as we are still working tirelessly to get the required amount. However do we still have the chance in receiving other offer letters from other universities as well?
25/1/24, 10:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed I have taken note of your concern and I will get back to your concern once we complete our letter discussion so that I can help you understand the query better.
25/1/24, 10:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
25/1/24, 10:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
25/1/24, 10:02 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Thank you
25/1/24, 10:04 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Noted, its okag i am still in contact with Mr Charles
25/1/24, 10:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, let me just share the details if you need them from refernce.

25/1/24, 10:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and then attend your previously shared query?
25/1/24, 10:11 PM - +263 78 501 1506: For now i have bo query i have understood you well but if there is anything that will come up i will quickly inform you
25/1/24, 10:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016. <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 10:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
25/1/24, 10:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDM University's credentials and official recognition by the government of India, you can visit their website by following this link: [PDM University - Recognition & Approval] (https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/).

25/1/24, 10:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarise yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
25/1/24, 10:35 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Thank you for the info
25/1/24, 10:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
25/1/24, 10:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
25/1/24, 10:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
25/1/24, 10:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the PDM and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 10:43 PM - +263 78 501 1506: I am clear about this
25/1/24, 10:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 11:02 PM - +263 78 501 1506: I was not aware of that, that could help.
26/1/24, 12:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to complete our letter discussion yesterday let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
26/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Good afternoon, thanks
26/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Good evening, yes i am here
26/1/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that so now may I know if you are ready to understand the transfer option?
26/1/24, 8:16 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Yes
26/1/24, 8:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM without risking losing out on the scholarship.
26/1/24, 8:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to PDM to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for PDM, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
26/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 78 501 1506: Yes i have understood this
26/1/24, 8:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So now do you have any other queries?
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 78 501 1506: For now i am good, thanks
26/1/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that so may I know if you were able to have a discussion about the letter with you family as well?
26/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 78 501 1506: We did, we are still looking for a solution
26/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 78 501 1506: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents you from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for you to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
26/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. Could you please let me know your the challenges that you are facing?

26/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order for me to understand your situation better here, I would like to understand how much have you raise so far and will be able to raise till the 2nd February?
26/1/24, 9:12 PM - +263 71 352 4889: I was waiting for this month's pay day which proved to be unable to cater for my kids requirements and Malvern's requirements,so there is nothing at the moment.However I have applied for a loan at the bank to try and cover this but I am not sure when I will get the money but am keeping my fingers crossed daily

26/1/24, 9:34 PM - +263 71 352 4889: End of the month
26/1/24, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, I am sure you must be receiving your salary by the 29 or 30 of the month, right?
26/1/24, 9:36 PM - +263 71 352 4889: Yes
26/1/24, 9:36 PM - +263 71 352 4889: 25th
26/1/24, 9:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you do not think it is too much to ask could you please help me understand how much do you get paid, I understand that it can be a personal question so if you wish to respond to the same over the personal window you can do that?
26/1/24, 9:39 PM - +263 71 352 4889: About $800
26/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 71 352 4889: If I work overtime about $1000 USD

27/2/24, 6:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing fine, thank you for asking.

Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $162 by now?

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded yesterday, it was past our available hours and hence I could not get back to you, however, I can connect now and I am sorry to hear that, may I know when you plan to get her surgery done?
28/2/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 352 4889: The money for surgery is quite a large amount,the surgeon requires about USD $1800 besides other expenses
28/2/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 352 4889: We are still talking to all family members to come up with the money ,then we can come up with a date but as of now I can't say when.
28/2/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 352 4889: We have only managed to have her visit a physiotherapist for about 2 weeks so far
4/3/24, 8:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Malvern.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are saying, however, I would like to know that the amount you mentioned above $1800, is the amount for her surgery right?

4/3/24, 12:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know if this session is held every week? If yes could you tell which day exactly?
4/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 71 352 4889: It's held every Tuesday and Thursday at my place of employment hospital,that's when the Physiotherapist comes.
4/3/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 352 4889: But he has advised that she needs surgery,the physiotherapy was just to help ease her pain.
4/3/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know when you plan on getting her surgery done as per the doctor which date has been recommended?
4/3/24, 3:11 PM - +263 71 352 4889: We will get the date from the doctor when he intents to visit this place for other surgeries as he doesn't live here.
4/3/24, 3:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that before we discuss about what possible solution can be offered I would like to ask one more question may I know how much are you able to save every month after the medical bills?

4/3/24, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I would like to extend our conversation further; however, an urgent matter demands my immediate attention. Let's reconvene tomorrow. Until then, have a blessed day, and please convey my regards to your family.
