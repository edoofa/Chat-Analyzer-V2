I have taken note of the same and will update the accounts team and the university officials for payment confirmation. However, I noticed that you made a payment of $500 instead of $563.

22/2/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, yes please as Ms. Vilsha must have informed you that you have received a grant of $100 hence you are suppose to pay $600 out of which you have paid $500, so now you are to pay $100 + transfer charges which is $75.
22/2/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, as per the update Ms. Vilsha shared, I wanted to inquire about Vincent's brother Wayne, may I know if you were able to pay his enrollment and registration fee as well?

28/2/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

12/3/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Thank you for sharing your concerns. Regarding the confirmation of the registration fee, I will request a breakdown from the accounts team so do not worry. For the offer letter here I would need you to understand us as well, you know there was a meet and greet event in Harare last month, due to which we are overwhelmed by the response, more than 1200+ students are waiting for their offer letter, the team, and the universities are also working tirelessly and hence the delay here is not intentional. I will still make more efforts for your application and will inquire from the team again rest assured your process is going to be smooth.

12/3/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 385 2419: You
