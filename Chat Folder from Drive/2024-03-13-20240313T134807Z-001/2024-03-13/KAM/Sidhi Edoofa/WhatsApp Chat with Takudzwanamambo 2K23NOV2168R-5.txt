19/12/23, 10:23 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 8:06 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I am available
19/12/23, 8:06 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Good evening sir 
Yes I am available for today's session
19/12/23, 8:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Chemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir the information states above is correct and accurate
19/12/23, 8:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/12/23, 8:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/12/23, 8:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir
19/12/23, 8:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 8:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 8:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.
19/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I have identified the purpose of the Edoofa Financial Secure plan
19/12/23, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
19/12/23, 9:04 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir 
I will surely pass my regards
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Takudzwanamambo!

I hope you are doing well today. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir
20/12/23, 8:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
20/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I was
20/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I would like the above points to be explained
20/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
20/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I do agree
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:55 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thanks you sir
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Takudzwanamambo!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I am available today's session <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I have
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
21/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I agree
21/12/23, 8:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
21/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I would like further explanation please
21/12/23, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
21/12/23, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes. Sir <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 9:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir
27/12/23, 7:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Takudzwanamambo. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 8:42 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir
27/12/23, 8:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir it is
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/12/23, 8:59 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Sounds affordable
27/12/23, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/12/23, 9:13 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
28/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Good evening sir 
Yes I'm ready
28/12/23, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
28/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I have understood
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
28/12/23, 8:21 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Tomorrow sir
28/12/23, 8:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir 
I will pass your regards
29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 8:12 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family?
29/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir I was able to have a discussion with my family and they only had one question to ask on the edoofa secure plan 
The question is in these ten months when we will be paying a deposit of $150 where exactly are we paying the money to?
Will the money be sent to your or we will be keeping it?
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:18 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir 
May you also have a wonderful year
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents of Takudzwanamambo,

6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

9/1/24, 9:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records.

9/1/24, 9:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

We are doing all well as a family

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

27/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes ma'am I was able to have a discussion with my family and they only had one question to ask on the edoofa secure plan 
The question is in these ten months when we will be paying a deposit of $150 where exactly are we paying the money to?
Will the money be sent to your or we will be keeping it?
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: According to Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you are required to deposit the amount of $150 every month with us. If you avail the bank's services, you will be required to pay $15 extra every month, and that can itself amount to $150 dollars in 10 months. However, if you deposit the same amount with us, you will also get the additional benefit of waiving off your remaining $150 from the enrollment fee. Don't you think that is greatly beneficial?
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 734 4102: Okay so we will be depositing 15 dollars every month to you or to the bank?
27/1/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You will be required to deposit $150 dollars with Edoofa every month. When I mentioned that you will have to deposit an extra $15 to the bank, I was referring to the interest rate on the $150 that you will be depositing in the bank. I hope you are following?
27/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes ma'am
27/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
27/1/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that Takudzwanamambo has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 734 4102: 10:00am to 11:00am
27/1/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will be concluding our conversation today, and will reconnect on Monday at 10:00 AM to further discuss the financial plan and your application process. Until then, please take care and extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you ma'am

We are all fine thanks.
29/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all fine. I am doing well too, thank you for asking.
29/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 10:52 AM - +263 77 276 6625: No ma'am I have not idea what SLICE CON is. 
I am sorry.
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 10:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Takudzwanamambo too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

Thank you.
29/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Takudzwanamambo. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 276 6625: What if we make it the 16th of every month - would that not have a problem since we have already missed this month 16th?
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, you may make the payment before this month ends, and from next month onwards we can set our monthly deposit date as 16th. Do you think that would be helpful for you?
29/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 77 276 6625: It would. Certainly. Thank you very much. 
And are we using the same method of payment, through Mr Jerera's FBC account?
29/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, you may use the same mode of payment i.e., through Mr. Jerera's FBC account. Thank you for sharing these details, your commitment to securing a seat in this exclusive program is appreciated.
