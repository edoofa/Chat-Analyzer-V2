19/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 4:02 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: I am ready
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 4:11 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Can you please further explain the second stage
19/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a very vital document for your application, as it serves as a personalized and comprehensive document that highlights your motivations, qualifications, and goals, providing admissions committees with valuable insights into your application. Since it is a subjective document, your inputs are quite important. After taking your detailed inputs, the Edoofa team will provide assistance in improving or improvising your SOP and then include the same in your application profile. As we proceed with our sessions, you will gain more clarity on the same. I hope this was helpful?
19/1/24, 4:18 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes it was
19/1/24, 6:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that it was helpful for you and cleared your query. I apologize for not being able to continue with our discussion today as it was a hectic day with many urgent meetings lined up. My operational hours for the day have concluded and I have had a long day already. Hence, I would love to reconnect with you tomorrow at 10:00 AM to continue with our discussion regarding your admission journey. If the timing is not suitable for you, kindly suggest a more suitable time frame and I will connect with you at that hour. I will be looking forward to it, dear. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
19/1/24, 6:54 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: At 12:00PM,if its fine with you
19/1/24, 6:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, Shamim. Thank you for letting me know. I will connect with you at 12:00 PM tomorrow. Have a blessed night, dear!
19/1/24, 6:57 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Thank you, And a blessed night to you too
20/1/24, 12:01 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Good afternoon ma'am
20/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shamim. How are you all doing today?
20/1/24, 12:30 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: We are very well thank you
And how are you?
20/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that Shamim. I am doing well myself, thank you for asking dear. May I know if you were able to follow all the details we discussed during our previous conversation? If you have any queries or thoughts related to it, kindly let me know so that I can assist you.
20/1/24, 12:34 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: No I do not
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/1/24, 12:46 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Can you please further explain both points
20/1/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The counselling session will be conducted through messages on WhatsApp within this admission group. Throughout the session, we will assist you in understanding the registration and admission processes more thoroughly, providing you with important information to navigate the next step of the admission cycle, namely, Step 4 - Offer Letter from the University/College. In this next step, once you receive an offer letter from a university, we will have a detailed discussion about the components in the offer letter to help you better understand the same. Rest assured that, with our guidance, you will gain a clearer understanding of the process as we progress. I hope this was helpful Shamim?
20/1/24, 12:58 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes it was?
20/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/1/24, 1:00 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Very clear
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: No , everything is quite clear
20/1/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/1/24, 1:13 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Alright ma'am
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

22/1/24, 4:51 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: In the first video, the founders introduce themselves.
They also encourage students to be open minded and teachable and that they should also be free to new ideas and that they should be willing to follow instructions.
22/1/24, 4:59 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: In the second video, the founders explain that the viaon of Edoofa is not only to make learning more affordable but also to train students making them capable of work and more  employable .
22/1/24, 5:14 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: In the third video, the founders explain how the school has worked so hard to try and allocate schools that offer quality and standard education for the students.

They also explain that the SOP is a very essential part of a students.
22/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! I am glad that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
22/1/24, 5:23 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes , we are

23/1/24, 8:00 AM - +265 986 31 12 17: <Media omitted>

23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DHnumPgjonF0l5ZAuefRlY
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: "Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Shamim MK Sadala, and my EWYL group name is Shamim EWYL23E1140. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 23/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
23/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________. (mention the date)
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is*  Ms Aditi*and she has scheduled my session for tomorrow, which is  24/01/2021*
23/1/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your message Shamim. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
23/1/24, 4:38 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Alright
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes, the information is correct
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/1/24, 4:56 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes it is not
23/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
23/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
23/1/24, 5:03 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes ma'am
23/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes ma'am
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
23/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes I have
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/1/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/1/24, 5:20 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Understood
23/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
23/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
23/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Very well understood
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
23/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/1/24, 5:23 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: No I do not
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
23/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:26 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Such a motivating picture
23/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Shamim. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
23/1/24, 5:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
23/1/24, 5:34 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes, I am
23/1/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
23/1/24, 5:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
23/1/24, 5:36 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes, I am
23/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, allow me to help you understand it better. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/1/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/1/24, 6:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end, however my operational hours for the day have concluded and it has been a long day already. I would like to schedule our session for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Until then, please take care and have a blessed night!
24/1/24, 7:32 AM - +265 986 31 12 17: Could you further explain this
24/1/24, 7:34 AM - +265 986 31 12 17: Good morning ma'am , I got caught up with some duties. But I  will be available for the next session at 3:00AM, if that's oky with you.
24/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Shamim. Thank you for letting me know. Do you mean 3:00 PM or 3:00 AM?

24/1/24, 3:14 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Good afternoon ma'am

24/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. We have already completed 3 steps of the admission cycle and our next step is *Offer Letter from University*. In order to commence the 4th step, we will require the said document. I would urge you to provide the same as soon as possible. If you could let me know of a tentative date by which you will be able to share the document, I will take a note of it and take an update from you accordingly. Could you kindly mention the same?

24/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. May I know which document out of the 3 are you going to share with us?
24/1/24, 4:37 PM - +265 986 31 12 17: Pardon?
