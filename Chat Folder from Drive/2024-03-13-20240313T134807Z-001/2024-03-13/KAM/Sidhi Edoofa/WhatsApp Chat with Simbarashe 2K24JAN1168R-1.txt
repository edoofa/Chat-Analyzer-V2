5/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the updated form with me. I have duly taken a note of it. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

I hope you are all doing good today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 10:31 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning maam.  I am well. I hope you are same
6/2/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking.
6/2/24, 10:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 11:11 AM - +27 78 003 4261: I am done. You can go ahead
6/2/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/2/24, 11:55 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Very clear
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
6/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
6/2/24, 12:14 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, I'm still okay
6/2/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 12:48 PM - +27 78 003 4261: I need clarity here, Simbarashe is writing his final exams in November this year and if successful he will only be going to University in August 2025. So approximately when is this registration fee due?
6/2/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee will be due once you receive the offer letter from the University. The application process for the 2025 intake will begin from the month of August 2024.
6/2/24, 1:00 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Understood.  Thanks
6/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Can I suggest that we wait for Simbarashe to also go  through today's session when he comes from school and we move on tomorrow
6/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In this next step, I will be sharing 4 videos with you that you will have to watch before our session tomorrow. Since Simbarashe will be going through our discussion today, I believe it will be suitable if I share the videos with you as well so that he is able to go through those as well. May I know if you agree? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 2:16 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes I do agree
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/2/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
6/2/24, 2:36 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes you may
6/2/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

Today I'll be able to participate either during breaktime at school (09h40 - 10h15) or during lunch time (13h05 - 14h50)
7/2/24, 6:23 AM - +263 78 702 5922: incase I am unable to by those times let me send the summary of what I understood after watching the four videos in the mean time
7/2/24, 6:24 AM - +263 78 702 5922: *Video 1:* 

I have to follow instructions and be open minded. I have been enrolled into the Edoofa program because I've been identified as an individual who matches the criteria for the type of student you are looking for. Steve Jobs was open minded when he reached out to experts (HP) when he wanted to make frequency calculator, he reached out to them because they were the biggest company at that time. He was open minded.

*Video 2:*

Edoofa's vision, to take somebody's potential (or capacity) and build success from it.

Due to high costs of education and dynamic job market conditions, Edoofa is offering me an opportunity to be able to be more employable at affordable costs.

What matters is my attitude towards this opportunity, I am required to put in as much effort as possible to be able to achieve my optimal greatness.

 *FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, BE OPEN MINDED AND COACHABLE*

*Video 3:*

Quality education which is affordable, Edoofa has been working very hard to build relationships with top [±250] schools in India. These schools have been handpicked because they match the requirements that Edoofa has set such as, college owners with good intentions (genuine), accreditation, quality of teaching staff, and culture. Edoofa has taken a lot of time into ensuring that I receive good education in India, as mention in the video, Edoofa are like my parents, the want to ensure that I receive education in a very good institution.

*Video 4:*

Statement of purpose, I have to convince the admission board and any schools in India why I am worthy of admission or scholarship in their school. I must be resourceful, and no delays.
7/2/24, 9:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe.

7/2/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 702 5922: is the statement of purpose meant to be written towards Edoofa regarding the scholarship or is it meant to be received by the schools?

I have written something earlier today
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is meant to be written for the schools, not Edoofa. With an SOP, you are trying to showcase your skills, abilities and qualifications, and it is to be addressed towards the respective university.
7/2/24, 2:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have written something related to your SOP. Kindly share the same with me so that I can add it to your application. <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 702 5922: I've written an SOP directed to Edoofa
7/2/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 702 5922: is it still okay if I send it here?

8/2/24, 12:38 AM - +263 78 702 5922: *2. Explain about BPM (Business Process Management) life cycle?* 

The BPM life cycle is a structured framework for managing business processes. It involves four phases: design, model, execute, and monitor. Each phase contributes to an efficient and effective process management system.

In the design phase, the process is identified and defined, and its goals and objectives are aligned with the value chain. The process flow, inputs, outputs, activities, tasks, and resources are specified. The design phase also involves identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will measure the process performance.

In the model phase, the process is simulated and tested using various scenarios and data sets. The model phase helps to validate the process design and identify any potential issues or risks. The model phase also helps to evaluate the impact of changes on the process 

In the execute phase, the process is implemented and executed using a BPM software or tool. The execute phase involves assigning tasks to the appropriate stakeholders and providing them with the necessary resources and information. The execute phase also involves integrating the process with other systems and applications. 

In the monitor phase, the process is measured and monitored using the KPIs defined in the design phase. The monitor phase helps to track the process performance and identify any deviations or anomalies. The monitor phase also helps to collect feedback from the process participants and customers.
8/2/24, 1:09 AM - +263 78 702 5922: *3. How does business contribute to economic development? Please elaborate and state
with an example* 

Economic development is defined as the transformative process through which simple, low income economies evolve into modern, industrialized ones. Businesses do play a pivotal role in driving this economic development.

To begin with, businesses hire employees, providing them with income opportunities. This will lead to an increase in the purchasing power of those within the economy further leading to an improvement in their standards of living. For example, a tech business startup hires software developers, marketers, and customer support staff, boosting local employment and income levels.


Additionally, innovation and productivity are considered to be key drivers of economic development because they allow businesses to create more value with the same amount or fewer resources. When businesses are able to innovate, they create more products, services or processes that improve job efficiency and can create new jobs. This can lead to higher levels of productivity and greater economic output. For example, Ford’s assembly line revolutionized manufacturing. Mass production of Model T cars set a new standard. Their innovations increased pproductivity, lowered costs, and made cars more accessible to millions.
8/2/24, 1:24 AM - +263 78 702 5922: *4. Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skill?* 

As I reflect on my days as a Rugby team captain, I realize how profoundly it shaped my leadership journey. Those muddy fields and adrenaline-fueled matches weren't just about scoring tries; they were my leadership crucible.

As captain, I stood at the heart of the huddle, rallying my teammates. My leadership style evolved—sometimes firm, urging them to push harder; other times, empathetic, understanding their fatigue. I learned that leadership isn't one-size-fits-all. Different players responded to different approaches. Some needed a fiery pep talk; others thrived on quiet encouragement.

Rugby is chaos in motion. In the heat of battle, I made decisions—kick for touch or take the scrum? Trust my instincts or consult the vice-captain?  I honed my ability to assess risks swiftly. Should we go for the try or secure points? Each decision had consequences, and I learned to weigh them carefully.

Our team was a blend of personalities, skills, and backgrounds. I fostered an environment where everyone felt valued.  Just like in a scrum, each player had a role. I ensured everyone understood their position, respected their teammates, and worked cohesively.

I didn't just wear the captain's armband; I embodied it. I pushed myself during training, tackled fearlessly, and played through injuries. I emphasized fair play, respect for opponents, and humility. A true leader doesn't gloat in victory or sulk in defeat.

Rugby taught me resilience, discipline, and accountability. These principles transcended the pitch. In essence, my Rugby captaincy wasn't just about wins and losses; it was my leadership boot camp. And the lessons learned? They echo in my professional endeavours, shaping my decisions, teamwork, and unwavering pursuit of excellence.
8/2/24, 1:36 AM - +263 78 702 5922: Human resource management (HRM) is the strategic approach and the practice of recruiting, training, and managing employees to ensure that they are performing their jobs effectively and contributing to the company's goals. HRM encompasses various activities, processes, and policies that aim to align an organization’s workforce with its strategic objectives, ultimately enhancing overall performance and gaining a competitive advantage. Some of the main functions of HRM include:

* Talent acquisition: HRM selects qualified candidates to fill job vacancies, ensuring a fair and unbiased recruitment process.
* Training and development: HRM identifies training needs and designs, implements, and evaluates training programs to improve employees’ skills and productivity.
*Employee engagement and satisfaction: HRM creates a positive work environment that fosters employee engagement and satisfaction, which in turn increases retention and loyalty.
* Compensation and benefits: HRM offers fair and competitive pay and benefits, conducting salary benchmarking, setting pay ranges, managing payrolls, and designing benefit plans.
* Conflict resolution: HRM resolves conflicts between employees or between employees and management amicably and within the organization’s guidelines.

HRM is important for every organization because it supports and nourishes its most critical asset – its human capital. HRM helps to foster culture, drive strategic planning, promote business sustainability and growth, ensure legal compliance and risk mitigation, enhance employee relations and productivity, empower managers, attract and retain top talent, and more. HRM contributes significantly to the success and effectiveness of an organization.

8/2/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe.

I hope you are having a good day. Thank you for sharing your answers and screenshots with me. I understand that there are electricity challenges in your school. That is completely understandable and you may share the LOR when you receive it from their end. Kindly ensure that the LOR clearly mentions your grade 12 examination subject combination. In the meanwhile, if you are ready, shall we proceed with today's session?
8/2/24, 9:56 AM - +263 78 702 5922: we shall
8/2/24, 9:56 AM - +263 78 702 5922: thank you for understanding
8/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well Simbarashe. Before we proceed, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February 2024).
8/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
8/2/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EBGVai3AWeHBfNIpC4JXYk

Simbarashe EWYL23E1237
8/2/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Simbarashe Madzokere, and my EWYL group name is Simbarashe EWYL23E1237. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

8/2/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date)
8/2/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 702 5922: okay thank you
8/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
8/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 702 5922: @27780034261 @27633519533
8/2/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 702 5922: Thank you for letting me know!
8/2/24, 11:03 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/2/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 702 5922: My father is well aware that the next payment of $150 is due on the 26th of February

may you please further elaborate on what you mean about preparations
8/2/24, 11:10 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Hello, yes I'm aware of the remaining Edoofa enrollment fee. We will pay as stipulated
8/2/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. When I mentioned preparations, I was referring to whether you have had the opportunity to align your finances in preparation for the upcoming payment.
8/2/24, 11:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
8/2/24, 11:49 AM - +27 78 003 4261: I can confirm on Simba's behalf that this is accurate
8/2/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
8/2/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
8/2/24, 12:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
8/2/24, 12:25 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. You are right
8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
8/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
8/2/24, 12:46 PM - +27 78 003 4261: We definitely wish to have something like this. Not only for Simbarashe but all our kids
8/2/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 702 5922: yes, this is correct
8/2/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
8/2/24, 1:32 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, please

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
8/2/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 702 5922: <Media omitted>
8/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your LOR with me Simbarashe. I have taken a note of it and have added it to your application profile successfully.

May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages?
8/2/24, 3:46 PM - +27 78 003 4261: I did go through them. May you kindly elaborate further
8/2/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
8/2/24, 3:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
8/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
8/2/24, 4:21 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Like we will be paying the money into some account or we can save on our own?
8/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa secure plan, you will be required to save with us. Allow me to proceed with our discussion so that you can get more clarity on the same. 

This means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
8/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
8/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
8/2/24, 5:25 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes I can see it clearly
8/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
8/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
8/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
8/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
9/2/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe.

I trust you've had a productive day thus far. It's time for our scheduled session. Before we dive in, I just wanted to check in and ask how you're doing today. How's everything on your end?
9/2/24, 10:24 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning ma'am
9/2/24, 10:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope everything is well on your end. During our previous session, we were discussing about the various constraints that a student and their parents might face. May I know if you were able to go through the messages?
9/2/24, 11:00 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. I did on my side
9/2/24, 11:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
9/2/24, 11:24 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, please
9/2/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of 25 February 2024.
9/2/24, 11:27 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Sure
9/2/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
9/2/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
9/2/24, 7:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, but it seems like we were not able to connect further. However, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February 2024).
9/2/24, 7:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
9/2/24, 7:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EBGVai3AWeHBfNIpC4JXYk

Simbarashe EWYL23E1237
9/2/24, 7:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
9/2/24, 7:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________ (mention the date)
9/2/24, 7:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know once you are able to go through my messages and join the group. On this note, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. Our operational hours for tomorrow (Saturday) are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. I hope you'll be available during this time for further discussion.

I will look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night!
10/2/24, 5:17 AM - +263 78 702 5922: I have tried to contact them on Thursday but I did not get any response
10/2/24, 5:17 AM - +263 78 702 5922: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
11/2/24, 11:57 AM - +263 78 702 5922: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Miss Ananya and she has scheduled my session for 12th February
12/2/24, 8:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Thank you for sharing the message with me. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:20 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning, 
I am very well. How are you
12/2/24, 8:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. To continue our discussion, if you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 8:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 8:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 8:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 9:02 AM - +27 78 003 4261: There is something I need to understand regarding this Secure Financial Plan and the outstanding $150 from the Enrollment fee. Does it mean if we take the secure financial plan we no longer have to pay the $150?
12/2/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct sir. If you decide to participate in the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, your remaining enrollment fee of $150 will be waived off. If this aspect is clear, shall we proceed with our discussion? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 9:38 AM - +27 78 003 4261: So this plan is compulsory for all applicants?
12/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is not compulsory for all the students. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan has been designed to help the students and parents plan their finances in a better way. Starting to save now, even in small amounts, sets the stage for a smoother journey towards academic goals. It's about building a solid foundation for your child's future and it empowers you to make informed decisions and pursue the best options available for your child's academic and personal growth.
I hope you agree with me?
12/2/24, 12:12 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes I do agree.
12/2/24, 12:14 PM - +27 78 003 4261: So if we agree to take this up, are we supposed to be paying the money immediately or we can choose a month when to start.
12/2/24, 12:14 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Also, is the saving strictly $150 or we can negotiate an amount that we can afford, say $100.
12/2/24, 12:22 PM - +27 78 003 4261: During the counseling process, we were told that if the student cannot get a place, the $350 enrollment fee will be refunded. Is it the same with the savings?
12/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan has been strategically designed to accommodate the remaining months leading up to Simbarashe's enrollment in August 2025. Therefore, it is supposed to _commence in February_ to ensure adequate time for saving before Simbarashe begins university.
12/2/24, 12:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The deposit amount is not strictly $150. Under the Financial Secure Plan, you will have the flexibility to select your preferred monthly payment date, and maintain consistent deposits for the next 10 months.
Additionally, if you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100.
12/2/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the circumstance when we as an organization fail to provide you a scholarship seat with an Indian university, you are eligible for a refund. Ever since you enrolled into Edoofa, we have been working hard towards your application to ensure that you can get a scholarship seat. Rest assured, that we will ensure that Simbarashe is able to get admission into the best university here for his higher education.
12/2/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope the above information is helpful with your queries sir?
12/2/24, 12:30 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, it is
12/2/24, 12:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Allow me to proceed with further details of the Financial Secure Plan -
12/2/24, 12:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 12:39 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Sure
12/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - +27 78 003 4261: It's all sounding wonderful
12/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
12/2/24, 2:12 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. I did. Thank you
12/2/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
12/2/24, 2:36 PM - +27 78 003 4261: I think I will use today and tomorrow and will be available again on Wednesday
12/2/24, 2:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Wednesday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
12/2/24, 2:39 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you
14/2/24, 8:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe,

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
14/2/24, 9:47 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning. I am well. How are you

14/2/24, 6:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/2/24, 7:12 PM - +263 78 702 5922: alright, great!
14/2/24, 7:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with this, I would also like to share another piece of information with you. To facilitate this event, the admission officers are playing a significant role in ensuring that all Edoofians get a chance to attend and can seize the exciting opportunities Edoofa has in store for them. Therefore, we will be unavailable until next week. We will reconnect with you next Thursday to proceed with our discussions and move ahead in your application process.
14/2/24, 7:47 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Excuse me, which Thursday
14/2/24, 7:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It refers to next week's Thursday.
14/2/24, 7:48 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Okay. Noted
14/2/24, 9:46 PM - +263 78 702 5922: <Media omitted>
15/2/24, 7:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Duly noted
15/2/24, 3:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/2/24, 5:58 PM - +263 78 702 5922: afternoon miss, may you please further elaborate on this examination
16/2/24, 6:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It will be based on your O level and A level subjects
16/2/24, 8:08 AM - +263 78 702 5922: is there any additional information that I am required to know?
17/2/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion, dear. Since the admit cards have been automatically generated through a software, due to some technical error it has mentioned "Do not communicate with fellow candidates during examination" instead of *"Kindly do not communicate with fellow students during the seminar in order to maintain decorum at the event."* 

The ESAT test will be conducted for students commencing their university journey in 2024. As your admission is scheduled for the 2025 intake, you will be eligible to sit for the test next year. I trust this clarifies your query. I hope that this helps with your query?
17/2/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 702 5922: okay, thank you very much for clarifying
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe,

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!
22/2/24, 1:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well.
22/2/24, 3:08 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you. I have also been very busy today. I hope to connect again on Monday
26/2/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 702 5922: I am doing very well, thanks how are you doing??
26/2/24, 10:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to attend the Meet and Greet Seminar?
26/2/24, 10:10 AM - +263 78 702 5922: yes I was able to be there
26/2/24, 10:10 AM - +263 78 702 5922: I had a great time there!
26/2/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that. May I know if you had the opportunity to click any pictures?
27/2/24, 8:24 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning,
May you please assist by creating Mama Money order so we can go pay the $150
27/2/24, 12:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly allow me some time to generate your order for Mama Money.
2/3/24, 3:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Simbarashe,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
6/3/24, 8:00 AM - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning,
We have been waiting for Mama Money order so we can pay the $150. Alternatively you can also give me the number in India where the money is going. I have a Mama Money account and I can create the order and pay
6/3/24, 8:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbarashe,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. I will share the details with you shortly.
6/3/24, 8:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - +27 78 003 4261: <Media omitted>
6/3/24, 2:38 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you. Proof of payment
6/3/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt with me. To clarify, could you kindly confirm whether you have made this payment towards your remaining enrollment fee or towards the Financial Secure Plan?
6/3/24, 2:43 PM - +27 78 003 4261: We chose to go ahead with the financial secure plan. So it's towards that
6/3/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please. Thank you for letting me know that. Before we can record payments towards the Financial Secure Plan, it is important that we are able to complete the formalities first. As this plan commences from the month of March, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
6/3/24, 4:10 PM - +27 78 003 4261: I am comfortable with the last date of the month. But I also have to wait for you to create an order which usually takes up to a week or so
6/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since Mama Money has a certain transaction limit for every month and day, there was a delay in creating the order. However, once we have decided on a payment method, all the required formalities will be completed in time to facilitate your payment.

As previously mentioned, your remaining enrollment fee of $150 stands to be waived off upon the completion of the first 10 months of the Financial Secure Plan. In such a case, since we have not yet been able to complete the formalities for the Financial Secure Plan, your payment of $150 will be recorded against your remaining enrollment fees.

Your Financial Secure Plan will begin from the month of April and continue till January. Upon successful completion of the plan, you will receive a waiver of $150. May I know if you are following?
6/3/24, 4:21 PM - +27 78 003 4261: So does it mean the $150 will be used to pay the 10th month
6/3/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your payment towards the enrollment fee will be adjusted in the 10th month, that is correct.
6/3/24, 4:23 PM - +27 78 003 4261: This me
6/3/24, 4:24 PM - +27 78 003 4261: But I will still have to pay $150 for 10 more months?
6/3/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Upon completion of the payment for the first 9 months, your 10th month will be waived off.
6/3/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, may I know if it is possible on your end to proceed with making the first installment towards the Financial Secure Plan in March?
6/3/24, 4:34 PM - +27 78 003 4261: Okay, understood

6/3/24, 4:46 PM - +27 78 003 4261: But if I start end of March, I will pay until end of November and then the $150 will be directed towards secure financial plan in December.  Is this correct?
