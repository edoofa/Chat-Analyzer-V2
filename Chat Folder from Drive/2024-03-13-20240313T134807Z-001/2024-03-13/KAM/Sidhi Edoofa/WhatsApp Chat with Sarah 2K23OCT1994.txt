26/1/24, 9:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sarah,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.
26/1/24, 9:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I understand that Sarah has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
30/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 78 758 5688: 5: 00 pm
30/1/24, 5:02 PM - +27 61 824 8053: 12noon

1/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah. I hope you are doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 7:34 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Hectic as always due to work pressure.  But l rate it better
2/2/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to availability issues we were unable to connect with each others. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion?
2/2/24, 1:30 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Please try highlighting what has to be done. I am on the darkest side of this
2/2/24, 2:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly let me know if you are having trouble connecting with us during our scheduled timing i.e., 12:00 PM?
5/2/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are all doing well. It has been a few days since we were able to connect with each other and I understand that it is due to your work commitments. In such a case, to ensure a smooth and timely progress in Sarah's application, could you kindly let me know about your availability between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can connect to have our discussions?
5/2/24, 6:54 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Thanks for the information.  I will be online then
6/2/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 12:04 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Very good and pleasing
6/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous conversations, you had highlighted an issue regarding your availability due to work commitments. In reference to that, could you kindly share a timeslot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when it will be suitable for you to have our sessions?
6/2/24, 12:29 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Ok 1:00pm
6/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will have our sessions at 1:00 PM from tomorrow onwards. I was going through Sarah's application profile, and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
6/2/24, 1:20 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes please.  Very correct
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 2:31 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Very correct and accurate madam
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 2:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 3:03 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Well noted and l appreciated
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I read and understand.  This gives me a clear view and can easily raise my child's performances without pulled out of any semester due to financial unavailability.  Thanks for clarifying all. All is now bright in my mind
6/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, I will help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works during our next session tomorrow.

On this note, let us conclude our session for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to proceed with the discussion about Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed evening ahead!
6/2/24, 5:27 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Thank your very much. May your wish be successful.
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
7/2/24, 2:05 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Things are perfect and pleasing despite the heatwave at 40 degrees ni Pretoria
7/2/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 758 5688: Of course
7/2/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
7/2/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
7/2/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
7/2/24, 5:53 PM - +27 61 824 8053: With pleasure and eagerness
7/2/24, 5:55 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Noted
7/2/24, 6:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to continue with our conversation, however, my operational hours have concluded and I have had a very long day. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the plan.

Have a blessed evening!
7/2/24, 7:03 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Same to you
8/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are all having a wonderful day. How is everything on your end today?
9/2/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah,

I trust this message finds you well. I had hoped to hear back from you yesterday but it seems we were unable to connect. I understand that things can get busy, so I wanted to reach out today to ensure everything is alright on your end.
9/2/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 758 5688: Everything is  good
9/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I was looking forward to our session yesterday, but I couldn’t reach you. Is everything alright, or was there a particular reason for your unavailability?
12/2/24, 4:37 AM - +27 61 824 8053: Network barrier. I was in Zimbabwe
12/2/24, 8:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah.

I hope you are all doing well today. I understand please, thank you for letting me know that. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?
12/2/24, 12:27 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Afternoon Madam. Things are having a very glossy smooth flow her.
12/2/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous discussion, we were talking about how the Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with our discussion -
12/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
12/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
12/2/24, 12:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
12/2/24, 12:46 PM - +27 61 824 8053: All noted
12/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
12/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
12/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
12/2/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
12/2/24, 12:58 PM - +27 61 824 8053: The issue of value from long savings l understands.  Nut since me as l am based in South Africa, the better l handle it
12/2/24, 12:59 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Nut❌ But✅
12/2/24, 1:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion caused on my end. However, I am sure you will be able to understand how a fluctuating economy can cause hindrance in future plans and savings, and why it is better to plan finances beforehand. 

Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved? <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 1:03 PM - +27 61 824 8053: You can explain please
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
12/2/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
12/2/24, 2:36 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Noted
12/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 4:52 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I welcome it
12/2/24, 4:56 PM - +27 61 824 8053: This message was deleted
12/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 5:16 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Very clear
12/2/24, 5:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 5:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 5:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 6:07 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Well noted
12/2/24, 6:07 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Very clear
12/2/24, 6:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
12/2/24, 6:11 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Understood thanks
12/2/24, 6:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
12/2/24, 6:14 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I will come to you soon once we discuss
13/2/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah,

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
13/2/24, 3:12 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes but with late responding since l am currently still at work

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were! <This message was edited>

Until then, I wish you a blessed week ahead. Kindly convey my regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
26/2/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 10:31 AM - +27 61 824 8053: Thanks for checking and back to me l am fine
2/3/24, 3:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 3:20 PM - +27 61 824 8053: 12 noon
2/3/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I look forward to reconnecting with you at *12:00 PM on Monday* for our session. Have a blessed weekend!
4/3/24, 11:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

 I hope you are having a wonderful morning. How are you all doing today?
4/3/24, 11:50 AM - +27 61 824 8053: We are doing very well
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week.
4/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
4/3/24, 11:56 AM - +27 61 824 8053: None of us make it to the meeting due to time frame which was so limited
5/3/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

I hope you are doing well today. That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?
5/3/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am interested in learning more about the challenges you and your family faced that led to your absence at the seminar so that I can do my best to ensure you don't miss out on any of the benefits.
5/3/24, 12:13 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes. Time frame.  It was so close
5/3/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since you were unable to attend the seminar, allow me to share some important insights from the event. There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.
5/3/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
5/3/24, 12:57 PM - +27 61 824 8053: We never had or come across one. The mai problem with us Sarah's parents is that of distance. We are staying far apart from each other ie father, mother and daughter.
5/3/24, 1:00 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Me since l am the only breadwinner, l make sure l provide  the basics without failure from livelihood to educational.  Yes there might be some hindrance but l make sure l prioritize the family first
5/3/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing that information with me. In such a case, I would like to share some impactful videos with you. One highlight was our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world. We also recorded messages from these students specifically for you.

Given the network challenges in Zimbabwe, I suggest finding a Wi-Fi location to download these videos. They offer a glimpse into life in India and will for sure resonate with your aspirations.
5/3/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://youtu.be/RRDsLQs3rzw
5/3/24, 1:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://youtu.be/zkWc3nMS32Q
5/3/24, 1:58 PM - +27 61 824 8053: All the videos worthy hearing and they made me wish if l was there or my daughter meeting fellow students.  So please to hear some stating there experiences with the institute
5/3/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so pleased to hear that. Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for Sarah's university education in the past couple of days?
5/3/24, 6:39 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes
6/3/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. I am pleased to know that you have been able to discuss the next steps. Could you kindly share your thoughts with me?
6/3/24, 5:58 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I was busy today and could not make it
7/3/24, 9:38 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know of a time between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when you can be available for a brief discussion regarding Sarah's admission process? We are currently running behind schedule and I am sure that you understand the importance of completing the formalities on time so that we are able to secure a scholarship seat in a timely manner for Sarah.
7/3/24, 10:06 AM - +27 61 824 8053: Thanks currently l am available
7/3/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. However, for our future sessions, it is essential that we decide on a time slot to ensure a timely progress. Could you kindly let me know that so that we can proceed with our discussion today?
7/3/24, 10:41 AM - +27 61 824 8053: We can proceed now
7/3/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
7/3/24, 10:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I checked our records, but unfortunately, I could not find your status. It is possible that there may have been an oversight, and so I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly to confirm.

Could you please let me know if you were able to attend the seminar and meet with us in your home country?
7/3/24, 10:50 AM - +27 61 824 8053: We as parent and Sarah herself failed to catch up since it was a short notice. We are 500km away from Harare.  Sarah too was even suppose to be given permission from the school authorities authorising her school departure.
7/3/24, 11:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your candor. Since you were unable to attend the event, would you like me to share the information that was shared with the students so that you do not miss out on it?
7/3/24, 11:45 AM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes please. With pleasure
7/3/24, 11:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.

7/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion sir. I am pleased to know that you were able to go through the videos the previous time I had shared it with you. In such a case, allow me to share more information with you regarding the SLICE CON.
7/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
7/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
7/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
7/3/24, 11:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am certain that after watching the video, Sarah too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.
7/3/24, 12:14 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Welcome
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,

I hope you are doing great and had a wonderful weekend. May I know if you are currently available for a brief conversation?
11/3/24, 12:20 PM - +27 61 824 8053: I am doing very well and currently available
11/3/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I am glad that we are able to connect today. I am reaching out regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
11/3/24, 12:28 PM - +27 61 824 8053: All was agreed and we are just cleaning up all old debts . We want to start on a clean sheet since our daughter  will be followed by her younger ones
11/3/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. It is important to plan your finances in the right way. Since the plan is supposed to begin in the month of March, I hope it is going to be feasible for you?
11/3/24, 12:36 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Yes the flexibility of clearing all debts and start on a clean sheet will make things a walk in the park. We will definitely walk the talk
11/3/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Sarah. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
11/3/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of March, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
11/3/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
11/3/24, 12:58 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Going into this future date determination it could be best for me to answer once l cleared up all and put 100% focus on that
11/3/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. Could you please provide an estimated timeline for when you plan to settle your previous debts and enroll in the Financial Secure Plan? This will help us ensure that we can coordinate accordingly and assist you in achieving your financial goals effectively.
11/3/24, 4:37 PM - +27 61 824 8053: Once l finalise with family at home soon l will let you know
12/3/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sarah,

I hope you are having a brilliant day. I understand please. In such a case, could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to have this discussion with your family?
12/3/24, 6:16 PM - +27 61 824 8053: The discussion can only take place if the three of us come together.  As of now l am currently in The Republic of South Africa  and the two which are Sarah and the mother in Zimbabwe but staying apart. Sarah stopped using the phone now for she want to concentrate on school work  since it's her final year as upper student.  Hopeful this Easter holiday we will walk the talk
