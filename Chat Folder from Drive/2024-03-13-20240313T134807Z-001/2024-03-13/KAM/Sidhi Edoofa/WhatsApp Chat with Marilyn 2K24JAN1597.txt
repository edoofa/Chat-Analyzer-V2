24/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Sorry but l have to take you back a bit. I had mentioned previously to our Counselor that Marilyn can only join us once the schools are closed because she's at boarding school and they are not permitted to use their phones there. So I'm not sure how we can go about this stage for now. For the completion of forms l can seek permission from the school authorities and go and have them completed once they give me the green light because visiting the school is only allowed on visiting days set by the school. I'm sincerely sorry for any inconvenience caused.
24/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. As Marilyn's parent, you may fill all the details in the form and submit the same. In her absence, you may attend all the sessions, and once she is available at home she can go through the chats and get a better understanding of the process with your help.
24/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Noted. Thank you

24/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For the next ten days, we will have sessions on a daily basis so that we can help you understand the process you and your family will be undergoing in the next one and a half years. These sessions are quite important for you and your family and hence in case, you as a student are not available, your parents can attend the sessions on your behalf. Hence, can you let me know at what time you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (between 09:00 AM to 05:00 PM)?

25/1/24, 11:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the EWYL form, you have mentioned the Program Availability and Orientation Availability date as 1 April 2024. I understand that your concern is that Marilyn is currently at school and she will be able to attend the sessions in April once she is back. However, I would like to inform you that since your admission process is on-going, you may proceed with the initiation of the EWYL program on her behalf as her parent. Once you have initiated the program, you can inform your designated EWYL mentor about Marilyn's availability and they will schedule the sessions accordingly. I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm following. Its okay
25/1/24, 11:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you kindly make the changes in the form and reshare it with me? For your reference, your EWYL program is scheduled to be initiated on 2 February 2024.

25/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents. Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
25/1/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Marilyn 2K24JAN1597)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
25/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
25/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Noted
25/1/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Marilyn EWYL23E1224)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
25/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm clear about the purpose
25/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counsellor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
25/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Thank you
25/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I have been impressed by more than enough aspects of the Program but considering our economic situation in Zimbabwe, I was more impressed by the one on one sessions with counselors, head of departments, the probability of a higher quantum of scholarship, EWYL Program, flexible payment plans and various payment options. Also the security features and students welfare ticked all the boxes.
25/1/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your feedback. It is a pleasure to know that you find the program to be so helpful and considerate.
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
25/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I'm ready
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I'm done
25/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
25/1/24, 1:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes they are clear
25/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
25/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
25/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm following
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
25/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes, very clear
25/1/24, 1:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes. Let's proceed
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
25/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm ready
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I have watched all the videos
25/1/24, 2:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow to discuss the videos in details. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour window between 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM to conduct our session?
25/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I think 12pm will do for me
25/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
25/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay. Thank you so much
26/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Marilyn.
26/1/24, 12:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 12:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this auspicious note, I want to check in on your and your family. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
26/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Good afternoon to you too
26/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Thank you
26/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 232 4967: We are doing great thanks and we hope the same can be said for you
26/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing great. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to watch the videos that I shared with you yesterday?
26/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I managed to watch them yesterday
26/1/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know sir. Could you kindly share your understanding of the videos?
26/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I understand that above all students and parents must be open minded and have the ability to follow instructions for them to achieve the most from the  Program. I also understood the efforts Edoofa makes to find the right schools and the procedures/checkpoints it goes through in the application and selection process. I'm glad that students don't only get Qualifications after the program but also the necessary skills to execute the jobs after school the fact that the students capacity for success is increased making them more responsible and independent. Through Edoofa students  and parents save money and time in the application process since almost every process they are guided and assisted by their counselors and admission officers by so doing they do away with bogus agents who try to make business from the education system. Basically Edoofa plays a vital role so students need to show commitment all the time
26/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing. I am glad to know that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly and grasp the message from our founders. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  I hope you were able to follow through with this?
26/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes let's go ahead
26/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Marilyn's application ahead and help her to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on Marilyn's application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Marilyn's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
26/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Marilyn's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I'm trying invain to connect with her at  school so that she can give me her inputs. When are we required to complete this task?
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since she is currently at school and you might not be able to complete the tasks soon, you may take some time to do the same. Could you kindly provide me with a date by when you will be able to fill out the form along with the answers?
26/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I called the school and they promised that they will get back to me by Monday afternoon. Today they said they are busy with sports and it will be difficult to get her for me to come to the office and share her inputs over the phone

Also, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (2 February 2024).
26/1/24, 2:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you as parents need to do:
26/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/El8Cwn3bcMa9qrjXt991Vy

Marilyn EWYL23E1224
26/1/24, 2:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your child have joined, please send the following message to the group:

26/1/24, 2:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for *________ (mention the date) <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
26/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Noted
26/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Noted
26/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. On this note, let us conclude today's session and reconnect tomorrow at 11:00 AM for our session. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
26/1/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Thank you. Same to you
27/1/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and Marilyn. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?
27/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Afternoon, we are great thanks and how are you doing ?
27/1/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing great. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to join the EWYL group?
27/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Sorry, I thought maybe we are meant to join after we submit BBA Academic Interview Questions. I can do that now if it's still okay to proceed
27/1/24, 1:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes sir, you can initiate the process and join the group now. You may also inform the mentor about Marilyn's availability so that they are able to schedule her session accordingly. I hope you are following?
27/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm following
27/1/24, 1:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. With this, can progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
27/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 23 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Okay
27/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes my preparations are in order
27/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Its accurate
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
27/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
27/1/24, 1:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
27/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I am eager to hear about the details
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
27/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
27/1/24, 1:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
27/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 232 4967: We really wish to have such a financial plan
27/1/24, 1:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
27/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes please help me
27/1/24, 2:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
27/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
27/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
27/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes l do agree
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
27/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
27/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes l can see this perspective
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
27/1/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Right
27/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
27/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes please explain in detail
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 20, 2023.
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
27/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes, right?
27/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/1/24, 3:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
27/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
27/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
27/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
27/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 232 4967: This is great. It makes the journey easier I guess
27/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
27/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes its correct
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
27/1/24, 4:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 232 4967: It's perfect. Just to be sure, the account will be in the student's name right?
27/1/24, 4:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
27/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I now understand it
27/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
27/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 77 232 4967: We can discuss tomorrow if you're available
27/1/24, 5:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Tomorrow is an off-day for us sir. We will reconnect on Monday. Could you kindly suggest a suitable time?
27/1/24, 6:08 PM - +263 77 232 4967: 11am will do
29/1/24, 11:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Marilyn. How are you all doing today?
29/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 232 4967: Morning. We're doing great and how are you?
29/1/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
29/1/24, 11:43 AM - +263 77 232 4967: I'm not familiar with it
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
29/1/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
29/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Marilyn too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
29/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/1/24, 11:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 77 232 4967: Definitely. She'll be excited.
29/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
29/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 232 4967: We discussed about the Plan and my family has no objections or queries
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Marilyn. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
29/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
29/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 77 232 4967: I prefer the 15th
29/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 232 4967: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya and she has scheduled my session for the 2nd of February 2024*
29/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your message sir.

This agreement is a crucial document that outlines the terms and conditions of your participation in the program.

29/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 232 4967: 1. Mthokozisi Bhuti Ndlovu
