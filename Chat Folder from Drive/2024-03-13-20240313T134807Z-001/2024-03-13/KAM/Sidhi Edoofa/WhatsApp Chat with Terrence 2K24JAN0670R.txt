7/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
7/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Terrence 2K24JAN0670R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
7/2/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Terrence EWYL23E1182)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
7/2/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yess am clear Mam
7/2/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes am ready
7/2/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 3:22 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky..you may now explain
7/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
7/2/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes they are clear
7/2/24, 3:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
7/2/24, 3:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
7/2/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes am.following Mam
7/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
7/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes ....noted
7/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 357 6095: But after joining Edoofa ... i would not pay the registration fee..since it will be nullified  ,correct??
7/2/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a misunderstanding Terrence. With Edoofa, you will not have to pay any extra charges for the application process in the universities. The registration amount is to be paid by you, however, it is not going to be an extra amount. It will be inclusive of your first year fees. May I know if we are on the same page here?
7/2/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes am now following
7/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/2/24, 4:47 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky ...we may start
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
7/2/24, 5:01 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes Mam ,am ready

9/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 357 6095: According to the videos ....Edoofa would act as my parents or guardian  who will be there to help me understand each process  as i prepare myself to learn more about the admission process .This equipped me with  the ability to work hard to secure a good scholarship as the videos gave me a better understanding .Also the Founders made it clear to me about getting admission to a University and  how am supposed to do .I was able to understand better and get a  clear picture   on how to  get Statement of purpose as this will surely garuntee me to get  a good scholarship.So am supposed to write the Statement of Purpose .And to be honest  most of my questions were answered.
9/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 357 6095: I would really like it if you may explain me more about the 2nd and 3rd video Mam as i wasnt able to understand the whole video.
9/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
9/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
9/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
9/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
9/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope that you find this to be helpful Terrence.
9/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes thank you so much Mam
9/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Terrence. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this? <This message was edited>
9/2/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes Mam
9/2/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session.
9/2/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
9/2/24, 5:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Along with this task, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. Letter of Recommendation*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>
9/2/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
9/2/24, 5:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 5:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for O Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
9/2/24, 5:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application.

Hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the documents with us?
9/2/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 357 6095: This message was deleted
9/2/24, 10:57 PM - +263 78 357 6095: I will submit the documents on Wednesday Mam......i would need to go back to my school so i could request the letter.
10/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Terrence.

I hope you are having a good weekend. I understand that you will need to go to the school to request for the letter. In the meanwhile, you can share the rest of the documents with me. Before we proceed, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?

I wish you a blessed weekend ahead!
10/2/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Thank you Mam...i shall do so
12/2/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Terrence.

12/2/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 357 6095: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Terrence. I am doing well, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to fill the SOP form?
12/2/24, 10:11 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes Mam let me send you the screenshot
12/2/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, Terrence. Kindly share the screenshot with me.
12/2/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 357 6095: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Here is the screenshot Mam
12/2/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me, Terrence. Before we move forward, could you kindly share your ID proof with me as well?
12/2/24, 11:35 AM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky Mam
12/2/24, 11:36 AM - +263 78 357 6095: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
12/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 15 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
12/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes Mam am aware ....thank you for reminding me
12/2/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes am about to pay the remainder soon Mam
12/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Diploma in Medical Lab Technology and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes it is accurate Mam
12/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Mam I wanted to confirm if it is possible to pay the remainder on the 16th of February
12/2/24, 1:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly share the reason behind this extension?
12/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 357 6095: This is when my parents are receiving their salary
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, kindly write an email to academicboard@edoofa.com and request them for a 1-day extension for the payment of your remaining enrollment fees. Kindly mention the name of your admission group (Terrence 2K24JAN0670R) and state your reason for requesting the extension. Kindly let me know once you have successfully sent the email.

In the meanwhile, let us proceed with our discussion.
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/2/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes thats true Mam
12/2/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky Mam let me do so
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed with our discussion, I have some exciting news to share with you.

12/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky Thank you Mam
12/2/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you have taken a note of the form. Let us continue with our discussion.
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
12/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
12/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Correct Mam....am following
12/2/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes Mam we are on the same page
12/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
12/2/24, 3:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yess Mam ....am following
12/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/2/24, 3:41 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky noted
12/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/2/24, 3:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Oky i understand
12/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
12/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/2/24, 4:02 PM - +263 78 357 6095: I have no question at the moment
12/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
12/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
12/2/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Thats very true Mam.....am also excited
12/2/24, 4:11 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Wow.....
12/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Terrence. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
12/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
12/2/24, 4:28 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes am excited Mam
12/2/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
12/2/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
12/2/24, 5:06 PM - +263 78 357 6095: No Mam ....may u kindly explain  further
12/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
12/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/2/24, 5:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/2/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 357 6095: No Mam...am following
12/2/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 357 6095: Yes , am very excited
12/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we conclude today's conversation, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey.

I hope you are all doing well. Kindly excuse me for the delay in response from my end. Thank you for sharing your letter of recommendation with me. May I know which email you are referring to?
21/2/24, 12:24 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Good afternoon Mam... Hwu today
21/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Mam, my mother was robbed on her way to pay the remaining fees so currently we are not able to pay the remaining fees
21/2/24, 12:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am so sorry to hear that Terrence. May I know if she is safe?
21/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Yes she is safe
21/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In such a case, may I know if she was able to file a police complaint about the robbery? I am sure they will be able to help you.
21/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Yes she was able to do that ... It's now a police case
1/3/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Terrence,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
1/3/24, 6:17 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Good evening Mam.. how are doing
1/3/24, 6:17 PM - +263 71 330 4528: No i wasnt able to attend the seminar
1/3/24, 6:21 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Mam since I wasn't able to pay the remaining fees on my time due to an incident and with the recent depletion in the country's economy I dont think my family would be able to pay any other fee required
4/3/24, 3:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Terrence,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?
4/3/24, 3:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am interested in learning more about the challenges you and your family faced that led to your absence at the seminar so that I can do my best to ensure you don't miss out on any of the benefits.
4/3/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please.However, I'm confident that your aspirations to pursue higher education are still intact. I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
4/3/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Good afternoon Mam
4/3/24, 3:58 PM - +263 71 330 4528: We discussed about my aspirations to pursue with higher education but unfortunately they are no longer able to proceed with university education due to financial problems which are at the moment dragging us down. My father and mother  are  no longer working because of the unstable economy here in Zimbabwe and this has become an obstacle for me to continue with the ghe program until my parents manage to find decent jobs. I am sorry to inform that my parents are no longer financially stable so in short they are broke, they are out of money to further fund my education.
4/3/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I am so sorry to hear that you and your family are going through this crisis due to the Zimbabwean economy. If I may ask, what occurred which resulted in your parents in losing their jobs, and if you have any plans currently on how you plan on moving forward as a family?
4/3/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Due to. high inflation, their salaries became less valuable and their companies were not able to pay for their services so they ended up losing their jobs
4/3/24, 4:23 PM - +263 71 330 4528: At the moment we are trying to use tge available resources  we have until we find other means of employment
4/3/24, 4:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing that with me, Terrence. I understand that such times can be incredibly challenging, but I am confident that you and your family will overcome this adversity and emerge even stronger. Your resilience and determination will undoubtedly help you regain stability and perhaps even surpass your previous status.
4/3/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, we are here to guide and support you through this difficult time, Terrence. It is important to first find a way out of this adversity.
4/3/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 330 4528: We surely hope so Mam, we hope we could overcome this tragedy but at the mean time we are now looking for other options
5/3/24, 9:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Terrence,

I hope you are doing well. I understand please. May you kindly share what you mean when you say other options? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 330 4528: My parents are thinking of enrolling me at a Polytechnic here in Zimbabwe for the mean time so are dont get behind my studies
5/3/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 330 4528: Good morning how are you doing Mam
12/3/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Terrence,

I hope you are keeping well. I was not able to connect with you earlier as I was not keeping well these past few days. However, I am doing much better now. Thank you for sharing that information with me, Terrence. I understand that your parents wish for you to enroll in a college in Zimbabwe itself. In such a case, as your admission officer, I have personally been quite invested in your application. I want you to receive quality education as per your calibre. In such a case, could you kindly share with me which polytechnic you plan on joining?
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 330 4528: Good afternoon Mam... am glad to hear that u are doing  well.Am planning to enroll at Harare polytechnic.
12/3/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 330 4528: In such case would you kindly return the enrollment fee so I would  be able to pay for my entry fee at Harare polytechnic
12/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Regarding the enrollment fee Terrence, I believe you must be aware that as per your Edoofa acceptance letter, it is mentioned that under the circumstance when we as an organisation fail to provide you a scholarship seat with an Indian university, you are eligible for a refund. However, in reference to our previous conversation, you are aware that this is not the case. You have chosen to withdraw your application from Edoofa, and hence are not eligible for the refund.
12/3/24, 2:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ever since you enrolled into Edoofa, we have been working hard towards your application to ensure that you can get a scholarship seat. Rest assured, that we will ensure that you are able to get admission into the best university here for his higher education. We have already received an offer letter for you, Terrence.
12/3/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe your diploma course will be for a 3-year duration, am I correct? Considering that you enrolled with Edoofa for quality and affordable higher education, I am sure that you are a dedicated student who wishes to excel in future. The course you have been enrolled into, Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology, is a course with a lot of scope in future. India is known around the globe for medicine. The employment opportunities you will be able to get once you have this degree will be very valuable for you in the future. In such a case, may I know if you are confident that you will be able to get good job opportunities back in Zimbabwe after completing your diploma from Harare Polytechnic?
