5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 7:17 PM - +263 77 211 5284: Yes they are
5/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 77 756 5352: They are clear
5/1/24, 8:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 8:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/1/24, 8:35 AM - +263 77 483 3055: Yes

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. In the meanwhile, let us proceed with out discussion.
29/1/24, 2:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I'm ready
29/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I am done
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 77 756 5352: They are clear
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
29/1/24, 4:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
29/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I'm following
29/1/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/1/24, 4:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 756 5352: They are very clear
29/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 483 3055: They are clear
29/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Yes let's proceed
29/1/24, 5:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded and I have had a long day, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Thank you

30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
30/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I'm ready. Please share

3/2/24, 11:21 PM - +263 77 483 3055: 2 . Thermodynamics is a branch in  physics that deals with heat , work and temperature and their relation to energy and physical properties of matter.It is guided by three laws:
 *Zeroeth law*states: If two systems each in thermal equilibrium with a third system they are in equilibrium with each other
 *First law* states: When energy passes in or out of a system (as work , heat or matter) the system's internal energy changes in accordance with the lawof conservation of energy
 *Second law* states: In natural thermodynamics process the sum of entropies of the interacting thermodynamics system never decreases.
They form a basis precluding the possibility of certain phenomena, such as perpertual motion. Thermodynamics explains how thermal energy is converted from one form to another and how matter is affected by this process .Thermodynamic systems is a specific portion of matter with a definite boudary on which our attention is focused. The boundary may be real or imaginary, fixed or deformed.An example is in a car, the engine burns gasoline to produce motion .The energy from the gasoline is converted into heat which is converted into mechanical energy by the engine which in turn powers the car
3/2/24, 11:21 PM - +263 77 483 3055: 3. A valve is a device for controlling the passage of fluid ,like water or gasor air ,through a pipe or ductor any other system especially an automatic device that allows movement only in one direction. It can be used to regulate the pressure or flow of the fluid . Examples are ball valves and gate valves 
A butterfly valve is a type of a valve that has a round disc called a "butterfly" (pivoted along one diameter) that rotates  to control the flow of fluid by opening and closing with a low torque rotation of 90° and works for any compatible application because they cost less and are lighter weight. It can be used to regulate the flow of fluids like water ,gas or air .They are often used where a quick and precise control of flow is needed , like in manufacturing processes or in the chemical industry. They are also used in HVAC systems and in fire protection systems
3/2/24, 11:22 PM - +263 77 483 3055: 4. Heat treatment is a process that involves heating and cooling metals or other materials in order to change their physical and mechanical properties. It is a group of industrial , thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical an sometimes chemical properties of the material. The most common application is in metallurgical heat treatment also used in glass manufacture. It involves the use of heating or chilling , normally to extreme temperatures to achieve desired results such as hardening or softening of a material .Heat treatment includes annealing , case hardening, precipitate strengthening ,tempering carburizing,normalising and quenching . Although it applies to only process where heating and cooling are done for specific purpose of altering properties intentionally , heating and cooling often occur incidentally during manufacturing process such as hot forming or welding <This message was edited>
3/2/24, 11:22 PM - +263 77 483 3055: 5. Compressors are machines that are used to increase the pressure of a gas or liquid. There are many different types of compressors, but they all work by using some kind of mechanical force to compress the gas or liquid. Some common types of compressors include reciprocating compressors, rotary compressors, and centrifugal compressors. Reciprocating compressors use a piston to compress the gas or liquid, while rotary compressors use a rotating impeller to compress the fluid. Centrifugal compressors use centrifugal force to increase the pressure of the fluid. There are many different types of compressors, but some of the most common are reciprocating, rotary, centrifugal, and scroll compressors. Reciprocating compressors, as I mentioned, use a piston to compress the gas or liquid. Rotary compressors use a rotary screw or rotary vane to compress the fluid. Centrifugal compressors use a rotating impeller to increase the pressure of the fluid. And scroll compressors use two interlocking spirals to compress the gas or liquid. There are also other types of compressors, like screw compressors and diaphragm comressors.There are two main types of compressors that are used in gas turbines: axial compressors and centrifugal compressors. Axial compressors have multiple stages of rotating blades that are stacked on top of each other. The blades compress the air as it passes through the compressor, increasing the pressure and velocity of the air. Centrifugal compressors, on the other hand, use a rotating impeller to draw in and compress the air. Gas turbines often use both axial and centrifugal compressors to achieve the desired compression ratio.

6/2/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/2/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Yes that is accurate
6/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Yes I would love to know about it
6/2/24, 5:03 PM - +263 77 483 3055: How does it help
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 756 5352: It is a good idea
6/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, allow me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works. As you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/2/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 77 756 5352: True
6/2/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I wish the same for you
7/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pearl.

I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
7/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 756 5352: We are doing well. How are you
7/2/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with the same -
7/2/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
7/2/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
7/2/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I can see it is clear
7/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
7/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
7/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
7/2/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
7/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 756 5352: That's very right
7/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before we conclude our conversation for today, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (9 February).
7/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
7/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BAEKyLLXbuPCF1MQBT2j0W
7/2/24, 6:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

8/2/24, 4:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pearl.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 756 5352: It was ok. How are you
8/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous discussion, we were talking about the various constraints that the students and parents face. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
8/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Please explain
8/2/24, 5:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since my operational hours have already been concluded, let us conclude our discussion here and we will reconnect tomorrow to discuss how the Edoofa Management has decided to help the students and their parents.

Before we conclude our conversation today, as promised, now that you are a part of the Edoofa Journey, the opportunity to help you self-fund your higher education and for you to be industry-ready s here, and in light of the same, I would like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey.

9/2/24, 5:55 PM - +263 77 483 3055: We are fine how are you
9/2/24, 6:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. I would like to continue with our discussion, however, as my operational hours have come to an end, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session.

9/2/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 756 5352: We will be available
10/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pearl.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
11/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 756 5352: Hello Ms Siddhi. Sorry yesterday we were out of network coverage.
12/2/24, 8:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Pearl.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I udnerstand please. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire, how is everything on your end today?
12/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 756 5352: We are okay
12/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous session, we were about to discuss how the Edoofa Management has designed a plan that helps the students with the constraints that we had previously discussed. Allow me to proceed with the same -
12/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
12/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
12/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
12/2/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Why is it for ten months
12/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 756 5352: It is a good program which makes fees payment easier
12/2/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 756 5352: Very correct
12/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 5:37 PM - +263 77 756 5352: May you please clarify further. Do you mean for 10 months I will be saving $150 monthly then then I will deposit that money in an FBC account from month 11-14
12/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You will be saving $150 with us for the first 10 months, and for the next 4 months, you will be saving $150 every month in a new FBC account under Pearl's name.
12/2/24, 6:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
14/2/24, 8:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Pearl!

Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not? <This message was edited>
27/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 756 5352: I have never heard of Slice con
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
27/2/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
27/2/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Pearl too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India.

27/2/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
27/2/24, 3:51 PM - +263 77 756 5352: It looks so exciting as evidently seen on the students faces. They are showing undivided attention
27/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, our students were thrilled to be a part of it. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 756 5352: We are still discussing the same and for the time being we are considering starting deposits in September  from her own share of the budget after paying up her exam fees and the termly fees
27/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Originally, the plan is supposed to commence from the month of February, such that we are able to save in a timely manner by the end of November for Pearl's higher education. I would like to provide you with a valuable insight. Pearl's registration fee towards the university scholarship seat will be due in the month of August, which will range from $500 to $1000. This is because her profile will be processed under early applications so that she is able to secure her scholarship seat in a timely manner. The plan has been provided to you to ensure that there are no last minute burdens on you and that you get ample time to save for the same. I hope we are together in this? <This message was edited>
