26/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
26/1/24, 4:34 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am ready...lets move on madam
26/1/24, 4:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I've studied it
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
26/1/24, 4:47 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes they're clear madam
26/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
26/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Quite rightly madam... following indeed
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it s clear madam
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 4:58 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes 

Let's go on madam
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/1/24, 5:04 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am ready madam..send them please
26/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

26/1/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled for tomorrow after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/1/24, 5:16 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: We can continue from 3pm madam tomorrow if it's okay with you over there.
26/1/24, 5:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 3:00 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
26/1/24, 5:29 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and have a wonderful afternoon
27/1/24, 2:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. & Mr.s Labanna and Winnie. I hope you are having a lovely day. How are you all doing today?

27/1/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video sir?

27/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Winnie's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

Accounting is a continuous process that helps in financial decision making and reporting, while auditing is typically conducted periodically to assess the fairness and transparency of financial statements. Accounting is performed by internal staff or external accountants hired by the organization, whereas auditing often carried out by independent external auditors to provide an  objective and unbiased evaluation.

2/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
2/2/24, 3:50 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes...but I was given a grace period of up to 18 February that I can finalize the payment of $150. Of which I asked for even more time as it will be not possible to gather that much within the period given
2/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly let me know who you talked to regarding the extension of the deadline and by when will you be able to pay the same?
2/2/24, 5:04 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok 
Let me search please
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: <Media omitted>

2/2/24, 7:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Kindly allow me time till tomorrow to take an update from Mr. Piyush, Head of Counselling. Let us conclude our conversation for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow for our session.

I wish you a blessed night ahead!
2/2/24, 7:49 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and good night too
3/2/24, 9:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Winnie. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 10:37 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: We're doing fine ,what about yourself over there?
3/2/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. Let us move forward with our discussion today. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
3/2/24, 11:03 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it is..


But can we continue at around 3pm as am on duty right now?
3/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. On Saturdays, our operational hours are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM as it is a weekend. If you are unable to proceed with the discussion currently, would it be more suitable for you if we reconnect on Monday at 3:00 PM?
3/2/24, 11:18 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Okay thanks
3/2/24, 11:18 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Monday it's fine
3/2/24, 11:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that sir. I will look forward to our session on Monday.

I wish you a blessed weekend ahead!
6/2/24, 2:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope that you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
6/2/24, 3:11 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Everything is on course sure what about yourself there?
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Everything is good here as well, thank you for asking. During our previous session, you had confirmed your chosen course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/2/24, 3:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/2/24, 4:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes for sure...but I know that probably you've an alternative to this may be?
6/2/24, 4:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I could not quite understand what you mean to say by alternative here. Could you kindly elaborate sir?
6/2/24, 4:25 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: I mean the assistance by securing a financial plan do that parents like myself should at least be not burdened for the expenses as expressed above
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, Edoofa management has curated a plan that will help the parents and students. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/2/24, 5:12 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes ... surely so
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/2/24, 5:13 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes please
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/2/24, 5:20 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I do agree
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/2/24, 5:32 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes..am following
6/2/24, 5:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I would like to continue with our discussion however my operational hours ended at 5:00 PM. Hence, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect at our scheduled time tomorrow to continue with our discussion.

Have a blessed evening!
6/2/24, 6:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and good evening too
7/2/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
7/2/24, 3:03 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Am okay thanks... what about yourself there madam?
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that sir. I am doing good, thank you for asking. In our previous session, we were discussing how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. There is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
7/2/24, 3:09 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes..I know that procedure sure
7/2/24, 3:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
7/2/24, 3:22 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Please do so that we should be together
7/2/24, 3:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before I do so, I would like to give you an update regarding your remaining enrollment fee payment. I have just confirmed from Mr. Piyush that your request for extension has been approved, and you may pay the same before the end of month this February.
7/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
7/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
7/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
7/2/24, 3:33 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks for understanding our situation
7/2/24, 3:37 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I do
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome sir. We understand that finances can get a bit stressful sometimes. Thank you for informing us about your situation, that enabled us to have proper communication and come up with an appropriate solution for the same.
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
7/2/24, 4:05 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Better ...and am following
7/2/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
7/2/24, 4:44 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it is..
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
7/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
7/2/24, 6:11 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Difficult surely...may I know how I can open an account with a Zimbabwean bank when am in Malawi? Do I need to travel to Zimbabwe and open that account or there's another way to do this rather than travelling to Zimbabwean?
8/2/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are having a good day. Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then. I understand that you reside in Malawi. In such a case, you can open an account with a national bank in Malawi. You need not travel to Zimbabwe sir.
8/2/24, 12:29 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok 
This sounds better
8/2/24, 12:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Our session is scheduled for 3:00 PM today. Hence, could you kindly let me know if you are available now to proceed with the same, or shall we reconnect at 3:00 PM for our session?
8/2/24, 12:54 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Let's talk at 3pm please
8/2/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand. In such a case, we will reconnect at 3:00 PM today.
8/2/24, 3:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon once again Parents and Winnie.

I hope that you are now available for our session. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 3:37 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am available and doing good
8/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you are doing good and are available for our discussion. During our previous session, we had discussed the procedure up until the 15th month of the plan.
8/2/24, 3:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
8/2/24, 4:03 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes I understand
8/2/24, 4:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/2/24, 4:31 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok..

If possible let it be  Saturday afternoon
8/2/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Saturday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
8/2/24, 5:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks and have a great time
10/2/24, 5:02 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Am.not clear here that am supposed to deposit $150. In which account is the money going to be deposited?
10/2/24, 5:02 AM - +265 999 52 82 02: Is it in my account opened with National Bank or your account?
10/2/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are having a good weekend. I understand your query. 
Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, it is required that you deposit an amount of $150 for the first 10 consecutive months with Edoofa, resulting in a total of $1500 at the end of this period. This measure is implemented to ensure your preparedness for paying Winnie's registration fee, which ranges from $500 to $1000, due in August 2024. By saving incrementally over several months, this approach enables a more manageable and adaptable means for you to finance Winnie's education, ensuring timely provision for their scholarship seat.

I hope this helped you in understanding the process better.
10/2/24, 1:39 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes.. understood..but am concerned to what I was told by one of the people I interacted with saying if we fail  say paper work or the average grade not being good enough to be considered for a place in any of your schools, colleges or universities,it'll mean the money paid are forfeited. This worries us that it will mean losing alot of money as it won't be given back.
10/2/24, 2:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the circumstance when we as an organization fail to provide you a scholarship seat with an Indian university, you are eligible for a refund.

Ever since you enrolled into Edoofa, we have been working hard towards your application to ensure that you can get a scholarship seat. 15+ years of experience has equipped us with detailed knowledge about the documents and paper work requirement for the admission process.
10/2/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In fact, when time comes, we will also provide you with VISA assistance along with guiding you about the documents that will be required for it. This is also another reason why we have included opening a new bank account under Winnie's name and maintain sufficient balance as part of the Financial Secure Plan, because as per VISA requirements, a specific balance must be maintained under the applicant's name to be eligible for the VISA.

Rest assured, that our team will ensure a smooth transition for you and help you in every step of the way forward.
10/2/24, 2:55 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: But as per our family discussion.,we agreed that if this money was supposed to be deposited in Winnie's account here and if there's need for bank statement then a provision could be given from that account. At this point we've not secured a university seat so to be depositing for something which is not yet secured we found it hard.
12/2/24, 7:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Winnie.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I was unable to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then.

I completely understand your perspective sir. Since I have been paying special attention to Winnie's application profile, I would like to share an insight with you. Over the past few years, 20% to 30% of our students were not able to come to India due to financial constraints. Even though they were provided with an offer letter, they were not able to meet the deadline due to which they lost out on the opportunity to secure their scholarship seat at the university, and hence jeopardizing their futures. Knowing this, the Edoofa Managament designed this plan to provide guidance and support to parents about the financial planning required for their child's higher education.
12/2/24, 7:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is designed to assist you in meticulously planning your finances, ensuring a smooth journey without last-minute hurdles. Winnie's aspiration to pursue higher education abroad aligns with our goal of facilitating comprehensive preparation for this endeavor.

I understand that your concern is about investing without securing a scholarship seat for your child. Rest assured, if we as an organization fail to provide you with an offer letter, your amount will be refunded.
12/2/24, 12:18 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Let me come back to you around 4 this afternoon as I am on duty right now
12/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I will reconnect with you at 4:00 PM today to further discuss this. Have a good day, sir!
12/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you've been having a good day. May I know if you are now available for our discussion?
12/2/24, 4:18 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Basically am still of the opinion of being reluctant of depositing into another account rather than my ward's account... because anything can happen and that my ward's can fail to be registered in any university with any other reason of which is unforeseen as of today.


Though you've elaborated well enough to me as a parent .. am of the opinion not to do as per procedure of depositing money into Edoofa account as of now. 
If by not following your underlying process means withdrawal of my application then it's unfortunate but if it will be okay to be depositing in Winnie's account then let me go through that process. 

 Sorry for the opinion made anyway. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand sir. The Financial Secure Plan has been carefully designed to help out students and parents to plan their finances better. In the past 15+ years, we have come across and helped thousands of students, and we curated the plan after meticulously understanding the kind of constraints they happen to face. If you believe that you will be able to save the amount by yourself, that is completely alright. This plan is not compulsory for students, it is only meant to help students plan their finances better, while also giving them financial benefits like the $150 waiver and the compounding bonus.
12/2/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, our team is going to visit Harare, Zimbabwe in this week to have a Meet and Greet Seminar with our Edoofians. While I understand that you reside in Malawi, if it's feasible for you to adjust your schedule and visit Harare during the weekend, you'll have the opportunity to meet our founders and experts in person. They'll be available to address your concerns and any other queries you may have. <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 5:01 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: One of your team offered me this invitation but I told him that I won't be be able to travel as we've some challenges starting from monetary to documentation like passport..I already extended my best wishes and probably we will follow the meeting through pictures and videos
12/2/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I would also like to provide you with an insight. We are also planning on visiting Malawi as well in the next month. However, nothing is finalized yet. Once the details of the trip have been finalized, I will surely reach out to you and share the same.
12/2/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since you wish to opt out of the Financial Secure Plan, I kindly urge you to write an email to academicboard@edoofa.com explaining that you were introduced to the Financial Secure Plan, however you wish to save for Winnie's higher education by yourself. Kindly explain your reasoning behind the same and also mention your admission group name (Winnie  2K24JAN0951).

Once you have sent the email, kindly let me know about the same.
12/2/24, 5:51 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks.waiting for this invitation
12/2/24, 5:51 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Thanks..will do that

I wish you a blessed evening ahead, and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
14/2/24, 9:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Winnie!

I hope this message finds you well. We are excited to share with you that a Meet-and-Greet Seminar has been organized this week in Harare, Zimbabwe. This event offers a unique chance to connect with Edoofa's visionaries and explore exciting opportunities.

Therefore, we will be unavailable until next week. We will reconnect with you next Thursday to proceed with our discussions and move ahead in your application process.
14/2/24, 9:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, we extend our invitation for you to join us at the Meet-and-Greet Seminar. The venue and time slot for your session are pending confirmation, we anticipate it will be held either on Saturday or Tuesday. You will soon receive a formal invitation from our team so that you can register for the event.

12/3/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Winnie,

I hope you are keeping well and having a brilliant day! I wanted to reach out to you regarding the payment for your remaining enrollment fees. Upon reviewing our records, I couldn't find a record of your payment. I just wanted to ensure that our records are up to date and inquire if you have completed the payment.

If everything is in order and the payment has been made, could you please share the receipt with me for our records?
12/3/24, 4:24 PM - +265 999 52 82 02: Not yet completed the payment yet ...was engaged somehow  but let me come back to you in two days
