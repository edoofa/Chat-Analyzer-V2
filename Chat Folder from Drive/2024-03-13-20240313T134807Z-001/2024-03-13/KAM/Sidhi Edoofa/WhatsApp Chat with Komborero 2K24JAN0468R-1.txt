Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counselling session with your counsellor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

After the initiation, you will have a 3-day period during which you will commence your EWYL orientation, specifically from January 23 to January 26 in your situation. Your EWYL program initiation date remains January 23, and you are required to input a date between January 23 and January 26 for your Orientation program.

20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you let me know by when you will be able to submit the form?

20/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I will look forward to getting an update on the same from you on Monday. In the meanwhile, before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how you and your family are doing today?
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 77 627 4716: We are doing well? How are you
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am doing well myself, thank you for asking. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 71 442 9614: We are ready.
20/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/1/24, 1:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 442 9614: Clear.
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
20/1/24, 1:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 442 9614: Yes.
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/1/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Clear.Thanks.
20/1/24, 2:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Yes
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
20/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 627 4716: The documents above are Manyonganise Komborero's 2023 ZIMSEC ZGCE Advanced Level Examinations statement of entry, 2023 ZIMSEC ZGCE Advanced Level Examinations results and School Authorities' Letter of recommendation.
20/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Yes.

26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 308 2544: That's is for question 1👆
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 308 2544: For question 2:
 *Laws of Thermodynamics* 
The Zeroth Law states that when two bodies A and B are each in thermal equilibrium with a third body C,then A and B are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.For example to determine whether A and B are in thermal equilibrium we bring each in turn into contact with a third body such as a thermometer.Experimentally,then,we bring A and the thermometer into thermal equilibrium and B and the thermometer into thermal equilibrium.lf the temperature reading is the same in two cases, we deduce but only with help of the Zeroth Law that A and B are in thermal equilibrium.

 *The First Law*
-It states that the total energy in a closed system is constant,that is,the energy is conserved in transfer of energy from one form to another.This law is also known as the principle of conservation of energy.
-For example when we warm a gas so that it expands,the heat we give to it appears as an increase to its internal energy and hence its temperature and partly as the energy needed for the external work done.
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 308 2544: *For question 3* 
-A valve is a device for controlling the passage of fluid or air through a pipe especially an automatic movement in one direction only
-A butterfly valve is a quarter-turn rotational motion valve that is used in pipelines to shut-off flow
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 308 2544: *For question 4*
-Heat treatment is a process where heat is applied to a material and then cooled to improve its performance, durability,and properties.
-lt is done to soften metal to improve formability and also to harden parts to improve their strength
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 308 2544: *For question 5*
-Compressors are machines used to supply air or other gas at increase pressure,for example to power a gas turbine
Rotary screw,vane and reciprocating air compressors are the three most common types of air positive displacement compressors.
-The air compressor used in gas turbines is of rotary type mainly axial flow turbines.
-Axial flow compressor are used in gas turbines because of their high efficiency and capacity.

*Dear Mentor, my name is Manyonganise Komborero, and my EWYL group name is Komborero EWYL23E1180. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 30/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
26/1/24, 4:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is* _________ *and he/she has scheduled my session for* ________. (mention the date)
26/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Okay
26/1/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 4:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 11 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Okay
26/1/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through this message, @263773082544 ? Feel free to highlight any queries or issues so that I can help you with it. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes the remaining fee will be paid before 11 February 2024
26/1/24, 4:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes
26/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 308 2544: It is correct
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
26/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
26/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes it is correct
26/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/1/24, 5:21 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Hello Admission officer,l am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor.The name of my Mentor is Aditi Kapoor and he/she has scheduled my session for 30th January from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM and our sessions will be held from Monday to Friday
27/1/24, 5:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Komborero. Thank you for sharing your message.
27/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Evening to you too
29/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero. How are you all doing today?
29/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 71 442 9614: Good afternoon. We are doing well. How are you?
29/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. Since my operational hours have already concluded, let us reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM to move forward with our discussion and ensuring a timely progress so that Komborero is soon able to secure an offer letter.
29/1/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 9:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero. I hope everything is well on your end. It has been a few days since we were last able to connect with each other, so I wanted to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 442 9614: We are doing well.
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 442 9614: This message was deleted
30/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 442 9614: Good morning. How are you?
30/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 308 2544: We are doing good how are you?
30/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all doing well. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Based on our previous interaction, we were discussing about the registration details and the fee breakup. May I know if you have any queries regarding the same so far?
30/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 77 308 2544: No l don't have any queries
30/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
30/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
31/1/24, 8:15 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes
31/1/24, 8:16 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Morning
31/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero. I hope you are all doing well today. How is your day going so far?
31/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 77 308 2544: We are doing good how are you ?
31/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, Komborero. Thank you for asking.
31/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our last interaction, we were discussing the details about the fee break-up. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the next part of the discussion?
31/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Yeah I'm ready
31/1/24, 9:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move ahead, your EWYL program was scheduled to begin yesterday i.e., 30 January 2024, however we have received a query from the EWYL team that you were not able to initiate the process. May I know if you were able to join the group and shared the above mentioned message?
31/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes l was able to join the group  and l shared the above mentioned message
31/1/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 308 2544: I have finished my session with my mentor now as our sessions are from 8:30 to 9:30 AM from Monday to Friday
31/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for bringing that to my notice. I have duly taken a note of the same.
31/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Okay good afternoon
31/1/24, 2:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our last interaction, we were discussing the details about the fee break-up. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the next part of the discussion?
31/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 77 308 2544: We can proceed
1/2/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero. I hope you are all doing great today! Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our operational hours had already concluded. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today and proceed with our discussion. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 308 2544: It is good how are you?
1/2/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am well, thank you for asking. So, during our last interaction, I shared with you a detailed example of a fee-breakup.
1/2/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
1/2/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $900 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
1/2/24, 2:21 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Okay I understand
1/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Good afternoon
1/2/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
1/2/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
1/2/24, 5:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/2/24, 8:23 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Okay thank you for letting me know
2/2/24, 8:25 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Morning
2/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero.

I hope you are having a wonderful morning. I am pleased to hear that you were following the details.
2/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
2/2/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 308 2544: I have no queries
2/2/24, 8:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. I have some exciting news to share with you! In such a case, let us reconnect tomorrow for our session and to discuss the way forward.

I wish you a blessed night!
4/2/24, 7:54 AM - +263 71 442 9614: OK.
5/2/24, 9:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Komborero.

I hope you all had a good weekend. How are things on your end today?
5/2/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 308 2544: We are doing good and the weekend was gud
5/2/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Alright please, Now, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps. <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
5/2/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
5/2/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes
5/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Thank you for sharing the photo
5/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
5/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
5/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes I'm excited
5/2/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
5/2/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
5/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes I'm aware
5/2/24, 3:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Could you kindly share the solution that you are aware of Komborero?
5/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 308 2544: You alleviate the financial burden of our parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000
5/2/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There is more to it Komborero. Let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
5/2/24, 3:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 29, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/2/24, 3:50 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes I'm following.
5/2/24, 4:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., *Offer Letter from University/College*. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
5/2/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes I'm excited
5/2/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Komborero. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
6/2/24, 8:16 AM - +263 77 308 2544: Good morning
6/2/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Komborero.

6/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 308 2544: This message was deleted
6/2/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 308 2544: No l don't have any query

1/3/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Komborero,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
1/3/24, 2:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I checked our records, but unfortunately, I could not find your RSVP status. It is possible that there may have been an oversight, and so I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly to confirm.

Could you please let me know if you were able to attend the seminar and meet with us in your home country?
1/3/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 627 4716: No l could not attend the seminar
1/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?
1/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am interested in learning more about the challenges you and your family faced that led to your absence at the seminar so that I can do my best to ensure you don't miss out on any of the benefits.
1/3/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 627 4716: I had a serious financial problem
1/3/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 627 4716: Okay
4/3/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Komborero,

I hope you are doing wonderful today. I understand please. Since you were unable to attend the event, may I know if I should share more information with you so that you do not miss out on important information?
4/3/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Yes of cause
4/3/24, 6:39 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Good evening
12/3/24, 1:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Komborero,

I hope you are keeping well. Kindly excuse me for not being able to reach out in the past few days as I was not keeping well. However, I am doing much better now and eager to continue with our discussion. May I know if you are currently available for the same?
12/3/24, 7:12 PM - +263 77 308 2544: Get well soon l'm doing well
