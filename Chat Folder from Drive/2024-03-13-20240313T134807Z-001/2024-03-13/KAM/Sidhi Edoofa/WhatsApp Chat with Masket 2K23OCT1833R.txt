27/1/24, 1:50 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
27/1/24, 2:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 3:49 PM - +27 81 046 0123: We are here for you
27/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you. I was going through Masket's application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 5:00 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
27/1/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that Masket has school during the weekdays and you are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 5:34 PM - +27 81 046 0123: 1pm-2pm
27/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, we will conclude today's conversation and reconnect on Monday at 1:00 PM to further discuss your application process. Until then, please take care and kindly extend my regards to your family as well.
27/1/24, 6:30 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Thanks for getting in touch with us, may you have a blessed evening further.
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope you are all doing well. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 3:07 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 3:09 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I am sorry,i was so busy,I had to attend our Client Safety meeting.
29/1/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for letting me know of the same. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our discussion?
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
29/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Political Science)  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:22 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:04 PM - +27 81 046 0123: For sure
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
29/1/24, 6:05 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Waaaal this is a bridge to the other side 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾, it makes it easier
30/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope everything is well on your end. I was unable to respond to your last message yesterday as our operational hours had ended. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi.
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +27 81 046 0123: We are all fine, how are you in India this afternoon?
30/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all fine. I am doing great, thank you for asking. In our last conversation, we were discussing the details about the Financial Secure Plan. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes ma'am, my you elaborate further so that we may have a detailed understanding of the whole concept
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
30/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
30/1/24, 5:57 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
30/1/24, 6:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:36 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Have a blessed evening too.
31/1/24, 1:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 1:30 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
31/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our previous interaction, we were discussing about the details of the Financial Secure Plan. Moving forward in today's discussion, by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 2:44 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Wonderful
31/1/24, 3:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
31/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
31/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
31/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
31/1/24, 4:15 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I see
31/1/24, 4:16 PM - +27 81 046 0123: At the present moment, we're residing in SA
31/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Even in South Africa, currently the exchange rate is 18.64, and has almost a 7% inflation from the previous year. I believe that even in South Africa, there are certain economical challenges that might come your way and expose you to financial constraints.
31/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
31/1/24, 4:53 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Please do
31/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
31/1/24, 5:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
31/1/24, 6:03 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I see
31/1/24, 7:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 9:21 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I had a busy schedule too, the day was long , have a blessed evening further.
1/2/24, 1:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket. I hope you are doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 1:23 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good Ms Siddhi,all is well with us.
1/2/24, 1:23 PM - +27 81 046 0123: How are you this afternoon?
1/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are available to proceed with our discussion?
1/2/24, 3:35 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
2/2/24, 2:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket.

I hope you are having a wonderful day today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our team is currently tirelessly working towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip this February. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
2/2/24, 2:51 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - +27 81 046 0123: All is well with us
2/2/24, 2:52 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Hope you are well too?
2/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. We were discussing the details of the Financial Secure Plan during our last interaction. Allow me to proceed with the same.
2/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
2/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
2/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 3:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Not a bad idea at all
2/2/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
2/2/24, 6:23 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Yes
2/2/24, 8:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are on the same page. Since our operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day, let us conclude our conversation for today. We will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 8:27 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Have a blessed evening too
3/2/24, 11:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Masket. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - +27 81 046 0123: Morning Ms Siddhi, all is well with us.
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - +27 81 046 0123: Hope you are fine too?
3/2/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that all is well on your end. I am doing good, thank you for asking. Continuing our previous conversation, allow me to help you understand the next steps in the last 10 months of the plan. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/2/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/2/24, 11:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
3/2/24, 11:55 AM - +27 81 046 0123: Fantastic
3/2/24, 12:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
3/2/24, 12:54 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Oh i have to ponder on it and then come back to you on this one
3/2/24, 1:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most people can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
3/2/24, 1:53 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Monday
5/2/24, 1:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Masket

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion on Saturday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation? <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 3:32 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi
5/2/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
5/2/24, 3:33 PM - +27 81 046 0123: I am sorry, I was occupied but the pressure have easied a bit
5/2/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Our surroundings tend to get quite hectic sometimes.
5/2/24, 3:35 PM - +27 81 046 0123: Very true
5/2/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through this message?
5/2/24, 3:44 PM - +27 81 046 0123: We covered quite a number of things, maybe we can recap so that I can catch up
5/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
5/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
5/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
5/2/24, 4:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Masket too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

This amount will be adjusted against your upcoming balances. May I know if this would be feasible for you?
5/3/24, 2:56 PM - +27 81 046 0123: It's okay let me work around it, let me settle down for this and will make adjustments as we go
