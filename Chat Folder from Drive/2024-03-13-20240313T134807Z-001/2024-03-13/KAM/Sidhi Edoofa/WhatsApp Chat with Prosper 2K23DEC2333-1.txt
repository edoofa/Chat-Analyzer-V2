This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/1/24, 10:25 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Prosper EWYL23E1131)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

16/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
16/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Can i say by Monday latest, when i have went and collected my results from the school

17/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. I have taken a note of it. Thank you for sharing the documents.
17/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 895 6269: yes please
17/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
17/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 895 6269: i am done
17/1/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.


*Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear. <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 12:27 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes, that is very clear and understandable
17/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
17/1/24, 12:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
17/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
17/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
17/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes please
17/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding, and until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually.
17/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
17/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
17/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes please
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

17/1/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Prosper, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarise your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 895 6269: I would've gone through them by 14:30
17/1/24, 1:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:30 PM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed rest of the day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Noted, thank you
18/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper. I hope your day is going well. How are you all doing today?
18/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Good afternoon ma'am and the team
We're fine thank you, how about you
18/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes, indeed
18/1/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you all are fine. I am doing well myself. Thank you for asking, dear.
18/1/24, 2:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the videos in detail? If yes, could you kindly share your understanding of each video individually?
18/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 895 6269: That is wonderful
18/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes i have gone through all of them
18/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Okay so in the first video, i understood that being open- minded and following instructions are essential in scoring maximum scholarship
18/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Secondly, the second video emphasizes on the vision of Edoofa
I understood the fact that Edoofa does not only aim to just get one admitted to school but rather to increase one's capacity for success and prosperity

Moreso, Edoofa seeks to make education very much affordable for students, through the Earn While You Learn program

I also got that one must capitalize on every opportunity. This is evidenced by the example of the cup and tank 

Moreover, Edoofa aims to increase one's chances of being successful
18/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. It seems like you have a very good understanding of the 1st two videos. May I know if you were able to go through the last 2 videos as well?
18/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes i did go through them
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Could you kindly share your understanding of the same, dear?
18/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 895 6269: The third video makes me understand that Edoofa helps you find or  identify the right school,  unlike agents, who just do it for money.

Edoofa acts more like parents, they identify which school is good for you, which school to go to and which one not to go to.

Edoofa also does support culture. This is evidenced by the story of the Holi.
Furthermore, Edoofa focuses on providing quality education that is very much affordable
18/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 895 6269: The last video is about the Statement of Purpose. I understood that it is a very crucial document. It is one's  only subjective document
The Statement of purpose is one of the important documents sent to the universities, together with my documents and the team's insights concerning me.

The Statement of Purpose includes my goals, vision, why i've chosen to study a certain course, why i seek admission at a certain school and also my experience with the admission officers
Students should be very precise in answering the form and also be fast
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Brilliant, you seem to have understood the founders’ message quite well! I am glad that you were able to go through the videos so thoroughly. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Okay thank you, so should i answer all these forms now or i can answer them anytime before 9:00AM tomorrow?
18/1/24, 5:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
18/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 77 895 6269: I will be finished by 9:00AM
18/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I apologize for the late response, dear. I got occupied with some urgent work-related situation. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the tasks. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
18/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Don't worry about it

Yes i do have a question...... When am i supposed to answer these forms that you shared earlier?
18/1/24, 7:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You can share the same tomorrow before our session, dear.
18/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Okay thank you
Have a good night
19/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 77 895 6269: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Good morning
Sorry, i am having network issues, that is why my form came in late
19/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 280 4603: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prosper. How are you all doing today?
19/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me, dear. I have taken a note of it.
19/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Good morning 
I am fine thank you and how are you
19/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 280 4603: Good morning 
We are doing great and yourself
19/1/24, 9:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you all are doing great. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking.
19/1/24, 9:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to complete the 2 tasks that were given to you? I can see that you already shared the screenshot of the 1st task. May I know if you were able to complete the 2nd one as well?
19/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 895 6269: 2. The differnce between rights and duties is that Rights areentitlements or immunity bestowed by the law whereas duties are obligations (responsibilities) arising from the law or from agreements one has with other parties, for example, employers. Stated differently, duties are things we are required to do in our own lives, whereas rights shield us against acts done by third parties

Civil rights and human rights are different by that human rights are rights one aquires by being alive, whereas civil rights are rights that are obtained by just being a legal member of a certain political state.

3. Both an attorney and a prosecutor are licensed lawyers who have passed the bar test and graduated from law school. Nonetheless, an attorney stands up for the person the prosecutor is attempting to persuade the jury is guilty of. These lawyers are on opposing sides of a criminal case. Whilst the attorney is seeks to raise a reasonable doubt in order to establish their client's innocence, the prosecutor  seeks to establish guilt beyond  a reasonable doubt.
19/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 895 6269: That is awesome to hear
19/1/24, 9:29 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes, i was still finishing off, as our network is bad today because of the weather
19/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear. That is quite alright. May I know if you were able to complete it?
19/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 77 895 6269: I want to study corporate law because of the travel opportunities that come with it and even diverse opportunities. This is because corporate law empowers one if they are interested in working with variable products in many fields throughout one's career
19/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Moving on to the forth question, i believe i have good communication skills. I am orally articulative.
Also, i am also very skilled in analytical thinking. This, i've gained through my A level studies where we were taught to think about to sides of a story, every story has 2 sides and can be critiqued
19/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 895 6269: I am also skilled in research skills. As we all know that lawyers rely greatly on their ability to perform deep research into topics related to cases they work on, i am also one of those
19/1/24, 9:53 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the answers, dear. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/1/24, 9:55 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 31 January 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
19/1/24, 10:01 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
19/1/24, 10:02 AM - +263 71 280 4603: The balance of $150 will be paid before the 31 January
19/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
19/1/24, 10:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes ma'am, correct
19/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/1/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 77 895 6269: understood
19/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
19/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 895 6269: That is clear
19/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes ma'am
19/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 895 6269: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
19/1/24, 10:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes he did
19/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Noted
19/1/24, 10:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 280 4603: Yes
19/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 280 4603: Sorry, I am now using my grandmother’s phone
Mine is out of power, we had no electricity
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand, dear. Thank you for informing me.
19/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 280 4603: Yes understood
19/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 11:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 71 280 4603: Understood
19/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.
19/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

19/1/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
19/1/24, 12:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

19/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 77 895 6269: Thank you, goodnight
20/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prosper. How are you all doing today?
20/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Good morning Ms Siddhi and the team, i hope you are all doing well this morning
It's already past 8:00AM, shall we begin our session for today?
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Good morning,  
We are all doing fine, thank you and you
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, dear. Thank you for asking. Yes, indeed. I regret not being able to connect with you earlier, however I am glad that we are connected now and can take the process forward.
20/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
20/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Absolutely great
20/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Wonderful
20/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 895 6269: No, please do share the solution
20/1/24, 9:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university [For most of the universities 15 days]. Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Ohhhh wow
20/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
20/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 77 895 6269: No all clear and understandable
20/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 895 6269: No, we can move forward
20/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (19 January 2024).
20/1/24, 10:00 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

20/1/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Understood
20/1/24, 10:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Absolutely
20/1/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.

With this, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Prosper. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
20/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 895 6269: Yes
Thank you, same to you
