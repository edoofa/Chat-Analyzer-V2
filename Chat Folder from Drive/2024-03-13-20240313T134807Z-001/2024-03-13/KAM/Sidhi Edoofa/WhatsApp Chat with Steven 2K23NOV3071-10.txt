29/12/23, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
29/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i agree with the above and i understood much better
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by 2nd Jan 6:30 PM.
29/12/23, 7:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself Steven. I am glad to know that you are also interested in music and it is amazing to know that you are a picture editor too. I was going through your application profile and it is my understanding that you have successfully completed the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yess
27/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes you are correct
27/1/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?

29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 327 6052: My day is wonderful. How are you today
29/1/24, 4:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving forward with our discussion today, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 327 6052: The information is very correct
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes may you help on that
29/1/24, 5:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you so mach
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Sory for being absent for the session i was overwhelmed by school work but i promise i will be active on tomorrow's session onwards.
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 78 327 6052: We are doing great, and you ther?
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, we had just started discussing the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
31/1/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
31/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes we wish for this
1/2/24, 10:20 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Simbrashe. I hope you are all doing wonderful today!

Kindly excuse me for being unable to respond to your message last night, as our operational hours had already concluded. Allow me to help you understand the Financial Secure Plan in a better way. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025. <This message was edited>

1/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
1/2/24, 10:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
1/2/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 327 6052: Sory im not Simbrashe
1/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I apologize for the confusion from my end Steven. As I am currently actively conversing with a lot of students, I happened to mistype. 

May I know if you were able to go through my previous messages Steven?
1/2/24, 12:09 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i agree
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
1/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
1/2/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i am so i will be paying half fee right
2/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is indeed correct. You will be saving up for your 1st semester of your higher education.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Allow me to proceed with our discussion yesterday. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Nice i understood
2/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 78 327 6052: No problem
2/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i do know
2/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Absolutely correct
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/2/24, 5:37 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i li
2/2/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 327 6052: I like
2/2/24, 8:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you like the approach. As much as I would like to continue with our conversation today, my operational hours have already concluded and I have had a long day already. Let us conclude our conversation for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan.

I wish you a blessed night!
3/2/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Steven. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 556 1006: Morning how are you
4/2/24, 7:15 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Hello sorry for not being available yesterday 🙏🏻
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you, every thing is going well
5/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. During our previous sessions, we were discussing about the various constraints faced by students and their parents , and the solution that Edoofa has come up with to help the students and their families. Allow me to help you understand the same -
5/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
5/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/2/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes im wondering
5/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
5/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/2/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/2/24, 6:04 PM - +263 78 327 6052: I think this is correct
6/2/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Steven.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message as our operational hours had concluded by then. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
6/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you for the greetings, my day is going well, and yours
6/2/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going good so far, thank you for asking. In our previous discussion we had discussed the details about how the plan works for the first 10 months. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
6/2/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes correct
6/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
6/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
6/2/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
6/2/24, 3:36 PM - +263 78 327 6052: It sounds so good but is it mandatory
6/2/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The plan is not mandatory for the students, however it does offer benefits like $150 waiver and flexibility, and it is exclusively for the students who have enrolled into the Financial Secure Plan.

Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/2/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yes i understood
6/2/24, 4:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/2/24, 4:47 PM - +263 78 327 6052: I think by tomorrow we will be through
6/2/24, 5:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
6/2/24, 5:31 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you so much
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Steven

It's that time of the year again when we eagerly anticipate our annual Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare. This event holds a special place in our hearts as it brings us closer to our community, and we're counting down the days with great anticipation!
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Just like clockwork, we're gearing up for the seminar next week, and I couldn't resist sharing our enthusiasm with you. Your presence would truly make the event all the more meaningful, guiding you on your journey to India. Hence, with immense joy, we wanted to extend the special invitation for the Meet and Greet Seminar to you and your wonderful family.
7/2/24, 11:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: And in the process of doing the same, I happened to notice that you haven't started your EWYL Program by now. In light of this, I had a discussion with Ms. Sanjana, the head of the EWYL Department, and I am happy to share that she has graciously agreed to make a special exception for you, expediting your application process.
7/2/24, 11:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a result, I have gone ahead and created your very own dedicated EWYL Group - *Steven EWYL23E1033*, adding both you and your parents to the mix.

7/2/24, 1:15 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Thank you so much
7/2/24, 2:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome Steven. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
7/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Im not
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
9/2/24, 5:28 PM - +263 78 327 6052: Yaa the wanna know if we can't afford $150 per month

2/3/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Steven. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
2/3/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of February, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
2/3/24, 11:44 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
2/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 327 6052: I will be free to let you know by tomorrow
2/3/24, 11:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, tomorrow is not a working day for us. In such a case, kindly share the information with me by day-end tomorrow such that the team is able to draft the agreement and share it with you on Monday.
