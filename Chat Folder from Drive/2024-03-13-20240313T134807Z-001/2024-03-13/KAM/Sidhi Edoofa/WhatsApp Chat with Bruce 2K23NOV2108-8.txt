*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

Secondly an Edoofian aimes to be best in their career choice ...and there is the Edoofa program wanting to see an Edoofian do greater than best in their career paths and also wanting them to see success as independent individuals in life and their societies .

Thirdly the Edoofa program wishes for their enrolled students to have an affordable  tertiary education internationally in India ,thereby there to guide the upcoming Edoofians to acquire greater scholarships and also being able to earn scholarship credits for all the  universities in their program offer this enthusiastic EWYL program for all their students to acquire their scholarship credits also helping in reducing their tution fees .

And last, but not least , an Edoofian needs to have certain basic  skills of being able to convince the universities , so that the persons are thrilled and anxious to know what is it best of an Edoofian has to offer to their environment and all this is accompanied by a document that is called the Statement of Purpose .Also allowing the Edoofian to share their traits ,solid educational archievements and their strengths

2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Yes all in line
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.

3. My dream company is Team Lease there in India and it is because this company offers a variety of employment opportunities to a variety of engineers who specialize in different paths .This is best for me because l love to see other engineers do their work not from my section so that l get to also learn how they do it and come up with a good result because you never know where this life takes one day l may need to use that kind of knowledge.

9/1/24, 9:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams.

13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills and helping others in need. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on and helping their family. I must commend this.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

26/1/24, 9:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Bruce,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Recently I was having a discussion with the Academic Board. They highlighted  that you have not been able to proceed with your admission process in a timely manner, since your child is at school and you have been occupied with work. Hence, I pitched in that I will be able to help you out and take over your application profile so that together we can ensure a timely and smooth progress. Since my operational hours accommodate your timings more suitably, I will be assuming the duties of your admission officer. I am optimistic that together, we can pave the way for an auspicious beginning to your academic journey, resulting in the right career prospects and eventual success for both you and your family.

27/1/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing well. I am doing fine myself, thank you for asking. Since this is the first time we are interacting, allow me to introduce myself. I am Miss Siddhi Singh, your Admission Officer. I belong from the vibrant city of Varanasi, known as one of the oldest living cities globally, Beyond my passion for education, I find joy in music and playing basketball. It is my pleasure to assist and guide you through the admission process, ensuring you achieve your dream education in India with the support of Edoofa.
27/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 332 9674: And am also glad to know you Miss Siddhi ...and thank for the support
27/1/24, 11:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The pleasure is mine. I was going through your application profile, and it is my understanding that you were able to successfully complete the 2nd step of the admission cycle i.e., Statement of Purpose. May I know if I am correct?
27/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes yes you are very correct mam
27/1/24, 12:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I understand that you have school during the weekdays and your parents are occupied with work. In such a case, I want to ensure that our sessions are held in a timely and smooth manner so we can comfortably proceed with your application process. Could you kindly suggest a 1-hour slot between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM when we can have our sessions?
27/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We can schedule the session to start at  4.00 PM ..it wil be okay

27/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay thank you will do so
29/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce. I hope you are all doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
29/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We are all okay l hope you are too...my day is quite okay just keeping up with my studies
29/1/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are working hard on your studies Bruce. Moving forward with our discussion today,to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes it's accurate ...
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
29/1/24, 5:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
29/1/24, 5:41 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yeah that's for sure am eager to know about this plan because l would really want to relieve my parents off the strees
29/1/24, 5:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, since my operational hours for the day have already concluded, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan and admission process. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!
29/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thank you and same to you
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello good afternoon
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope everything is well on your end. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We are doing all right how are you
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. In our previous discussion, we were talking about the Financial Secure Plan. Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
30/1/24, 5:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
30/1/24, 5:49 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes it is exactly what we would like to have upon our future
30/1/24, 6:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 6:30 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay thank you
31/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello
31/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
31/1/24, 4:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce. I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are you all doing today?
31/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 332 9674: All well.we are having a wonderful day
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that.  In our previous conversation, we had discussed certain details of the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to help you understand it better. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
31/1/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes true
31/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes true
31/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Mm yes that's true
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
31/1/24, 5:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
31/1/24, 5:56 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Oh yes
31/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Clearly seen mam and l would to know about the transport costs too just to be sure
31/1/24, 7:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I was looking forward to continuing our conversation, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded, and I have had a long day already. I have taken a note of your query and we will discuss the same tomorrow. Let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. Have a blessed night!
31/1/24, 8:27 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thank you same to you
1/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
1/2/24, 4:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are all doing great today. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response as our team is currently engaged in the preparations for our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in February. May I know if you are available to proceed with our discussion?
1/2/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Ohh okay no problem..
We can continue
1/2/24, 5:32 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Gd afternoon
2/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
2/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
2/2/24, 4:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We doing fine Ms ...and l hope we can continue with our discussion
2/2/24, 5:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Definitely, we will be continuing with our discussion today. During our previous interaction, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. Allow me to proceed with the same.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: There is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
2/2/24, 5:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
2/2/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes that's true
2/2/24, 7:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. I will explain to you how this has been achieved during our next session.
2/2/24, 7:10 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay mam good to hear that ...
2/2/24, 8:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session.

I wish you a blessed night!
2/2/24, 9:44 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thanks same to you
3/2/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 358 2224: Morning we are all fine
3/2/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. In our previous conversation, I was explaining to you how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan will help in overcoming the constraints.
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
3/2/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
3/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok sure
3/2/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 332 9674: We doing okay
3/2/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes would like to know
3/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
3/2/24, 12:55 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
3/2/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
3/2/24, 12:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
3/2/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I can say it is a good idea ...but can also be stressful upon my parents for they are trying to cover for 3 children.... so now  l can give sometime to my parents to digest all of the above
3/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 358 2224: It is a good idea though we can,t afford to reserve $150 every month we have other siblings to look after so we can,t afford that
3/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Maybe there should be another plan  thank you
5/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Good afternoon
5/2/24, 4:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you all had a great weekend. I was unable to respond to your message on Saturday as our operational hours on Saturdays are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
5/2/24, 4:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, the plan is not asking you to deposit extra funds. It is only allowing you to plan and consistently save small amounts from this month onwards, so that you do not face any financial constraints during August, when Bruce will start receiving offer letters from universities.
5/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me provide you with a clearer understanding. In the 2024 intake, once students receive their offer letters, they must pay the registration amount of $500 to $1000 within 15 days. This tight timeframe has made it challenging for 20-30% of students to proceed with their higher education in India.

To address this issue, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan. By depositing $150 each month, you can start saving for Bruce's first year of education now. This plan aims to ease any future financial pressures during the registration period.
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Gd afternoon
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok now clear thank you
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Sure it's good thank  you for that
5/2/24, 4:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/2/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Correct
5/2/24, 5:17 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Correct
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/2/24, 5:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/2/24, 5:59 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Oooh okay l understand this one ....
5/2/24, 6:21 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok l understand
6/2/24, 2:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. I am pleased to hear that we are on the same page with our discussion. Before we proceed, I would like to ask how your day has been going so far?
6/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: My day is okay ..and yours? <This message was edited>
6/2/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. My day has been going good, thank you for asking. In our previous session, we had discussed how the Financial Secure Plan works for the first 15 months. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
6/2/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes l have ...but let's l hope it all goes well because it is quite costly for my family  so l pray it all goes well .
6/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 332 9674: And if l can ask , what if l fail to reach that amount in time what will be next ...with my process and future?
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case you are unable to make the monthly deposits on time, kindly inform us beforehand so that we can understand your situation and work together to find a solution for it.
6/2/24, 4:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/2/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Okay
6/2/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I think by Monday l would have discussed the issue with them
6/2/24, 5:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if your parents are currently unavailable for you to have this discussion with them?
6/2/24, 5:06 PM - +263 77 358 2224: We are fyn
6/2/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. May I know if you will have the opportunity to discuss the plan by tomorrow or day after?
6/2/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 358 2224: I think we will discuss during the weekend his father is not around and he is not on WhatsApp so l think Monday  we will give you the update
6/2/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Having a detailed discussion with him is quite important and if he is going to be available on the weekend, I hope that you will be able to discuss the same with him during the upcoming weekend.

On this note, let us conclude our conversation here and we will reconnect in a few days' time.  I hope that by then you will be able to have the discussion with Bruce's father. Have a blessed evening ahead!
6/2/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Sure thank you same to you
7/2/24, 11:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce

Have a blessed week ahead!
8/2/24, 9:16 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Thank you
12/2/24, 4:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce

Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
12/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello am avaiy
12/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 332 9674: ... available
12/2/24, 5:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
12/2/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 332 9674: No am not familiar with that
12/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
12/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/2/24, 5:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Bruce too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.
12/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/2/24, 5:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
12/2/24, 5:47 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I have read ...it's quite an experience
12/2/24, 6:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Bruce. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
12/2/24, 6:13 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Nothing really to address but one thing l understood is the money required for all this plan is just too much a burden l can say because my father is self employed and my mother is a civil servant and with their earnings per month they cannot be able to save such an amount monthly because they have to take care and provide for my 3 siblings accordingly.So in conclusion it's just too much and l also understood that because l would also want my siblings to reach A-level and pass too l would not want my name to be also holding back their future
13/2/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are doing great. Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the Financial Secure Plan with me. I completely understand where you are coming from, and it makes me happy to know that you are so thoughtful for your siblings.
13/2/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan has been designed to help the students and parents plan their finances in a better way, and it is not an additional cost as we are helping you prepare for the first 1.5 years of your higher education. Starting to save now, even in small amounts, sets the stage for a smoother journey towards academic goals. It's about building a solid foundation for your future and it empowers you to make informed decisions and pursue the best options available for your academic and personal growth. I hope you agree with me? <This message was edited>
13/2/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes I get it...
13/2/24, 10:30 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The amount you save over the next 10 months, totaling $1500, will cover your registration fees due in August 2024. The remaining funds will be allocated for your expenses upon arriving in India in August 2025. This early preparation ensures that your first year of education is financially secured, giving your parents additional time to plan and save for the remainder of your higher education journey. Starting early is key as it alleviates the burden of payment deadlines, allowing you to be well-prepared in advance. I hope you understand what I am trying to say?
13/2/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes l do ...

26/2/24, 11:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Am okay how are you
26/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the last weekend, Team Edoofa had been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. Now that things have settled down a bit, I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for participating in the event and playing a role in its success. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

26/2/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your insights from the event are incredibly valuable, and I'm keen to hear about your experience. Would you be willing to share your thoughts, including your interest in attending similar events in the future and any suggestions for improvement? Moreover, if you've captured any memorable moments in photos, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with us.
26/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I don't have anything to say
26/2/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Well l sent some of the pictures
26/2/24, 12:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. During our previous discussions we were talking about the importance of saving early for your higher education. I had also shared with you that since your profile will be processed under early applications to ensure that you are able to secure a scholarship seat with the best university, your registration fees will be due in the month of August. May I know if you were able to go through my messages and agree with me when I mention that it is important to have savings for our future?
26/2/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes l agree....l went through them
26/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The Financial Secure Plan aims to ensure that the last moment burden can be prevented and with consistent saving, we are able to save the amount for your higher education journey. May I know if we are on the same page here?
26/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes we are
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Considering all of these factors, may I know if you were able to discuss the benefits of the Financial Secure Plan and if you will be participating in it?
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 332 9674: My parents will se that to themselves and unfortunately I don't think l wi ll be participating
26/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: By opting for the Financial Secure Plan, you not only secure your child's scholarship seat without any financial burdens but also avail yourself of significant savings through the compound bonus. With a waiver of $150, you are effectively maximizing your savings and ensuring a smoother financial journey.

Furthermore, being a part of the Financial Secure Plan offers additional benefits such as the adjustment of the enrollment fee towards your university fee, providing further flexibility and convenience in managing finances.
26/2/24, 2:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I sincerely believe that participating in the Financial Secure Plan will provide you with peace of mind and financial stability, ultimately paving the way for you successful academic journey, and as your admission officer I want the best possible opportunities for you. I understand that you do not wish to proceed with participating in the Financial Secure Plan. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
26/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 332 9674: I clearly understand that and also wanted to be part of it...but it ain't that flexible for my parent's pockets ..
27/2/24, 11:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are doing well today. I understand your situation please. In such a case, could you kindly share with me how you plan on saving for your higher education? Understanding your planning better will help us in aligning our goals and working together towards it. As your admission officer, I want to ensure that you are fully prepared for your higher education journey.
27/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Hello my parents will have to answer that one
27/2/24, 1:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, Bruce. Could you kindly let me know when they will be available to have a discussion?
27/2/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 332 9674: Oky
28/2/24, 8:34 AM - +263 77 364 7611: Good morning everyone, i'm the parent and therefore to have some discussion with you Team Edoofa as your request.
28/2/24, 8:38 AM - +263 77 364 7611: Hello
28/2/24, 12:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are having a lovely day. Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Bruce previously mentioned that you do not wish to participate in the Financial Secure Plan, which is being offered in order to ensure constant support and stability towards saving funds for Bruce's higher education. In such a case, as your admission officer, I wanted to get a better understanding of your financial plans for Bruce's higher education journey, so that we can be on the same page and work towards our collective goals i.e., to ensure that Bruce is able to secure a scholarship seat with the best university.
28/2/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Hello good afternoon Admission Officer  
I am kindly asking for an elaboration of the Financial Secure Plan.In this regard the request is majorly on how often the money is deposited into the bank,the effects of bank charges on the final accumulated money that would have been deposited in a particular time frame and finally whether the monthly deposit fee is fixed and if yes then why is that so when it is meant to be flexible. 
Coming in with another angle ,judging on the fact that Bruce's parents (my auncle and aunt) have 2 other school-going kids that require many school related expenses to be met-up almost monthly too.Therefore a fixed deposit into the bank will be rigid for their spread in budget as their income fluctuates and isn't constantly fixed .This goes with a promise that Bruce's money will be ready when needed.
28/2/24, 2:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me, allow me to address them one at a time. Firstly, the plan includes depositing small amounts consistently for 20 months such that there is no last minute financial burdens on parents or the students. For the first 10 months, you will be required to save with us by the end of which we aim to save $1500. This amount will be used against Bruce's first year of education. In the 11th month, we will assist you in opening a bank account under your name, where you will save for the next 4 months. Then, for the remaining 6 months, you'll have the flexibility to decide whether to continue saving with us or in your personal bank account.
28/2/24, 2:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Secondly, the international transfer charges depend on the mode of payment that you will be choosing for the payment. We will provide you with multiple options to choose from, and you can select the method that is the most feasible and convenient for you.
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thirdly, the monthly deposit amount is not fixed. Since our end goal is to ensure that we are able to save $1500 in the first 10 months, as a standard the suggested monthly deposit amount is $150. You will have the flexibility to select your preferred monthly payment date to ensure a consistent deposits for the next 10 months and also decide on the amounts you wish to deposit each month.

If you have a surplus budget exceeding $150 in any given month, you have the option to deposit that amount, which will then be adjusted with your subsequent deposits. For instance, if you deposit $200 in March, your next payment due in April will be adjusted to $100. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 618 0909: I clearly see the logic in this and truly  understand your vision and motive to prepare students for any inconvenience in money readiness hence having the funds deposited bit by bit to achieve a certain amount 
Well, in as much as this sounds like a tasty offer it isn't convenient for the setup of Bruce's family and their financial structure owing to reasons I listed briefly just above(other kids with fees).
I love how you guys haven't made this mandatory thereby we as a family would not want to go against the stance that this wouldn't suit the way my aunt and auncle would have loved to meet up to the school fees
28/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Thank you for briefing me on this ..I hope you understand our side of the story concerning this financial structure 
Kudos
28/2/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 364 7611: Not meaning we don't want to participate in the Financial Secure Plan, but how to start with since we are at zero point and the way we're surviving in Zimbabwe it's hand to mouth , our source of income monthly very very little so as to make $150 monthly banking we don't meet that. So is there any other kind of help in the Edoofa to ASSIST such a situation we have as parents.
28/2/24, 3:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from, and it is completely reasonable. The Financial Secure Plan is flexible, and if you wish to make alterations to it, kindly feel free to suggest the same. It would be helpful if you could share with me the amount you can afford at the moment, considering the payment of school fees for your other children as well.
28/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 364 7611: Ok will come back.
28/2/24, 3:44 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. Kindly take today's time to discuss this with your family and we shall reconnect tomorrow to further discuss the plan. I wish you a blessed evening ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
28/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Cheers
28/2/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 364 7611: Thank you, and you too have blessed evening.
28/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 618 0909: @919540716843 
Do you still have a few minutes to spare for a brief discussion?
28/2/24, 3:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, I am available.
28/2/24, 3:50 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Olk for sure
28/2/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Is the Financial Secure Plan mandatory?
28/2/24, 3:51 PM - +263 71 618 0909: And for alterations do you mean we can make payments of whatever amounts of money are ready for deposit?
28/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is not mandatory, however, participating in the plan offers you additional benefits.

1. By being a part of the Financial Secure Plan, you will receive a $150 waiver, provided all the conditions in the agreement have been met. If you have already completed the payment of $350 towards the Edoofa Enrolment fee, the amount of $150 that you paid for the Edoofa Enrolment fee will be adjusted towards your university fee and hence can act as a part of your 10th installment. If you are yet to pay the remaining $150 towards the Enrollment Fee, it will be waived off and you can continue with the Financial Secure Plan as discussed.
28/2/24, 3:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. You will also receive a compound bonus to the savings you are achieving choosing to save with Edoofa rather than a bank. Typically, banks charge a monthly "bank fee," amounting to approximately $15 based on your deposit amount. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, not only do you get to save an amount of $150 overall, along with that you are getting a waiver of $150. In recognition of the commitment demonstrated by you through timely installment payments, you will be eligible for the $150 waiver.
28/2/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Wow
So this mathematically saves 300 dollars from the total amount one would fork out if they neglect this procedure
28/2/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely, that is possible. However, for legal purposes, we will be required to draft an agreement. For the same purpose, you will be required to share an estimated amount that you will be able to deposit in each month based on your projections.
28/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Oh so it's not a random thing whereby if you feel like paying maybe 70 dollars that month you do it?
It requires the projected monthly amount to be met up??
28/2/24, 4:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Since your matter of concern is genuine, I would also like to share another insight with you. According to standard university procedures, upon receiving their offer letters from the university, students are required to pay a registration fee ranging from $500 to $1000 within 15 days. This tight timeframe has made it challenging for parents and students, resulting in 20-30% of students being unable to pursue higher education in India despite qualifying for Edoofa Scholarship and getting a seat at their desired university. In response, Edoofa has introduced the Financial Secure Plan for the 2025 intake to alleviate these constraints and ensure that students can secure their scholarship seats without financial constraints. This is an indirect benefit where you will receive a longer timeframe to prepare and contribute towards the next step in Bruce's higher education journey.
28/2/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed. The plan will be bound by an agreement acceptable to both parties. The reason this is being done is to ensure that we are able to make consistent savings. If, for any reason, you are unable to make the payment before the deadline due to insufficient funds, you can inform us about the same beforehand and we can most definitely work together to find a solution for it.
28/2/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 618 0909: So the benefit of the Financial Secure Plan in this instance is a lengthened period to pay up for registration on the University one would have gotten a place??
28/2/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Clearly explained and certainly understood 🫡
28/2/24, 4:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is a savings plan. The amount that will be saved will be adjusted against Bruce's first year of education. When I mentioned that you will get a longer period of time to pay for the registration amount, I wanted to highlight another point of view which can be considered as a benefit.
28/2/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 618 0909: And most importantly what is the 1500 dollars that we will be trying to raise from the Financial Secure Plan to meet up to?
Is it for the securing of a scholarship place at the university he would have gotten a place or what 
Make the usage of the 1500 clear to me one more time
28/2/24, 4:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. If you have any more thoughts or queries, kindly feel free to share them with me.
28/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Ohhhh definitely got that
So 1500 is for expenses Bruce will incur in his first educational year right
28/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 71 618 0909: I've gotten the valid important information i wanted 
Cheers
28/2/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The registration fee due towards securing Bruce's scholarship seat will range from $500 to $1000 depending on the university that accepts his application. In a good scenario, he might even receive offers from multiple universities. Hence, out of the $1500, $1000 has been allocated towards the registration amount. The remaining $500 has been allocated towards the fee payment that will be due once Bruce arrives in India. This has been done to ensure that by the time Bruce reaches India, there is no stress to save or accumulate funds for the first year of education. By following the timeline of the plan, you will be able to save in a timely manner and will be prepared for all the future expenses.
28/2/24, 4:19 PM - +263 71 618 0909: Alright
28/2/24, 4:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly let me know if you have any more concerns or queries and I will be glad to help you. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 71 618 0909: For now there aren't any pending misunderstandings but we will definitely get in touch if needs be ,after a discussive conversation as a family
28/2/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. It is quite important to discuss all the details as a family in order to make an informed decision. Let us conclude our discussion here for today, and we will reconnect tomorrow.

I wish you and your family a blessed day ahead!
28/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 618 0909: We appreciate your presence 
Cheers
29/2/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are having a pleasant day. I am reaching out to inquire if you were able to have the discussion regarding a suitable approach for the Financial Secure Plan?
1/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 358 2224: We are fyn $80 per month is what we can manage
2/3/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are having a pleasant Saturday afternoon. With the team focused on preparations for the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, it has been a few days since we have been able to connect on a regular basis. Hence, I am reaching out to schedule our next session on Monday between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to catch up and ensure we are back on track. I urge you to take some time out to discuss all the aspects of the Financial Secure Plan, and jot down your queries and thoughts for our discussion on Monday. Could you please let me know a convenient one-hour time slot within that window for our discussion?
2/3/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Ok 4:00PM it's fine
4/3/24, 3:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are things on your end today?
4/3/24, 4:00 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Good afternoon everything is Fyn and how are you
4/3/24, 4:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that everything is well on your end. During our previous discussion, you had mentioned that for the time being, $80 will be a feasible amount for you for the upcoming few months. May I know if you will be able to cover up the balance towards the end of this year such that we are able to save $1500 towards Bruce's higher education? Our collective goal is to ensure that we are able to save enough in a timely manner such that you do not face any difficulties at a later point when it is time for you to pay for Bruce's registration fees in the month of August in 2024.
4/3/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 358 2224: I can,t promise that maybe if it was June or July 2025 that money will be saved
4/3/24, 4:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you wish to save that amount by end of July next year. However, starting to save now, even in small amounts, sets the stage for a smoother journey towards academic goals. It's about building a solid foundation for your child's future and it empowers you to make informed decisions and pursue the best options available for your child's academic and personal growth. I hope you agree with me?
4/3/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 358 2224: I agree but  your deadline you said end of this year so if it extends to July next year we can save the little we have to reach the $1500
4/3/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, since you were able to take a step in the right direction by joining the Edoofa family, we will help you in ensuring that you are able to secure a scholarship seat with the best university promptly as soon as the early applications open this August in 2024. May I know if you agree that this will be helpful for you?
4/3/24, 5:00 PM - +263 77 358 2224: I agree
5/3/24, 9:45 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are doing well today. I am pleased to hear that you agree with me. In such a case, would you find a plan that helps you in maintaining that consistency such that we are able to achieve saving the amount by August of this year?
5/3/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Gd afternoon No plan yet as things are tough here in Zimbabwe
5/3/24, 4:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan has been designed to help the students and parents plan their finances in a better way. Starting to save now, even in small amounts, sets the stage for a smoother journey towards academic goals. It's about building a solid foundation for your child's future and it empowers you to make informed decisions and pursue the best options available for your child's academic and personal growth. I hope you agree with me?

As you are aware, the registration fees for Bruce's university application will be due in the month of August and the amount will range from $500 to $1000. In such a case, considering your situation, our primary focus for now will be on the registration amount. May I know if you are following?

6/3/24, 4:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Upon discussion with my team, we came up with a unique solution for you. We have made a few changes to the Financial Secure Plan for your benefit. The revised plan will be as follows:

You will be required to make a payment of $100 for the upcoming 10 months. Upon successful completion of the payments, you will receive a waiver of $100. Subsequently, once Bruce's registration process is finalized, you can proceed to clear the remaining balance of $500. Upon completion of this payment, you'll receive an additional waiver of $50.

These waivers of $100 and $50 are part of the $150 waiver offered by the Financial Secure Plan upon successful completion. They've been adjusted to align with the revised plan. <This message was edited>
