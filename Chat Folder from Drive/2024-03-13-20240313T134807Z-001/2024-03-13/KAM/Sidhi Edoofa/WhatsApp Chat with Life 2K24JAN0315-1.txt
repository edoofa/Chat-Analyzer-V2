The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

19/1/24, 11:08 AM - +263 78 186 0145: Im done .
19/1/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
19/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes
19/1/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 186 0145: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 12:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your recommendation letter with me, Life. However, you are required to get it attested with the stamp and signature of the authority who is providing you with the letter of recommendation. I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Oky let me send the one with the school stamp
19/1/24, 3:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, Life. I will be looking forward to getting an update from you for the same. I apologize for the delay in my response as I had to attend an urgent work-related meeting. I hope you are still available to continue with our discussion dear?
19/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes
19/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes Ms Siddi
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counselling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 4:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Oky
19/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 4:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes it's clear
19/1/24, 5:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 5:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. You may take today’s time for the same. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
19/1/24, 5:25 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the task by tomorrow before our session. <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 9:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/1/24, 10:29 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the task that has been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us tomorrow? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 186 0145: By 8:00 I'll have completed Ms Siddi
29/1/24, 10:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, since our operational hours begin at 9:00 AM, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 AM for our next session. Is the timing suitable for you?

30/1/24, 5:29 AM - +263 78 186 0145: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:34 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Life. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
30/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 488 2427: Morning.We are doing good.How about you over that side
30/1/24, 9:48 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking.
30/1/24, 9:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counselling on university admission*.
30/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 10 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
30/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 488 2427: In line with meeting the payment deadline everything is in the right direction.Thank you for reminding us
30/1/24, 10:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.

In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelors in Computer Application and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
30/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 326 9699: Yes  the information you have is correct.lf all goes well we are planning for him to arrive in lndia in August 2024
30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 326 9699: Thanks for your elaboration Ms Siddh
30/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
30/1/24, 11:59 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
30/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 326 9699: Yes she explained about it
30/1/24, 2:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 186 0145: Yes Ms Siddi
30/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 326 9699: Ok l understand Ms Siddhi
30/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask whether you were able to join your EWYL group whose link I had shared with you yesterday?
31/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Life. I hope you are all doing well today.

Your EWYL program was scheduled to begin yesterday i.e., 30 January 2024, however we have received a query from the EWYL team that you were not able to initiate the process. May I know if you were able to join the group and shared the above mentioned message?
3/2/24, 10:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Life.

I hope you are having a lovely morning. It has been a few days since we last connected and I was wondering if everything is okay with you and your family. May I know if everything is well on your end?
6/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 186 0145: Hello Ms Siddi
6/2/24, 10:07 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Life.

6/2/24, 12:03 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you had been preoccupied with something due to which we were unable to connect with each other in the past 1 week?
6/2/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 186 0145: No ...we are doing the EWYL
6/2/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. However, I have been trying to reach out to you since the past few days, and since you did not respond I could not help but wonder if everything is alright on your end. Could you kindly let me know if there were any reasons due to which we were unable to connect?
8/2/24, 10:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Life. 

I hope you are all doing well. 
I understand that you may be busy with work and have also started your EWYL journey. However, it has been 10 days since we began the 3rd step in your admission cycle, which is counseling on university admission, and currently, we are falling behind the schedule. To ensure that you are able to complete your admission process in a timely manner, it is important that we have our sessions regularly. May I know if we are together in this?
12/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Life,
