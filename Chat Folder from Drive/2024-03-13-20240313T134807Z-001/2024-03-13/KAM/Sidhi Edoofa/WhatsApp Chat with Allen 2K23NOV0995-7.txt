It is alright, may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
4/1/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Good evening sir
Yes I am ready
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/1/24, 7:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
4/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes they are clear
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/1/24, 7:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
4/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
4/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok sir u can

9/1/24, 9:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

12/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Good morning sir.
So as of this year I'm writing my final examinations. I'm a bit scared but am willing to risk it all I really wish to pass with flying colors. I want to make a difference in the world and become a successful somebody to make myself and those that look up to me proud.
12/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that your academics are your main priority and want to become a better version of yourself by helping others in need.

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].

1/2/24, 4:49 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen. I hope you are all doing great today. How has your day been going so far?
1/2/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am 
We're doing alright and our day has been great so far.
1/2/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 810 4432: How are you doing today?
2/2/24, 4:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message last night as our team is currently working tirelessly towards the preparation of our upcoming Zimbabwe trip in the month of February. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to ask how are you doing today?
2/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 77 810 4432: We're doing just fine ma'am.
How are you doing.
2/2/24, 5:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that Allen. I am fine too, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through the videos that I shared with you day before yesterday?
2/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am.
2/2/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I did watch the videos.
2/2/24, 5:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly share your understanding of each video with me?
2/2/24, 5:48 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok so they were saying that as an Edoofian you should be able to be teachable and follow all the instructions.

They talked about how some people are making a business off giving scholarship but Edoofa is mostly concerned about the students' education, they'll enroll one in the best universities, universities which themselves have examined.

They talked about how Edoofa wants to make students responsible before entering into the world.

And in the last video they talked about the Statement of Purpose.They said a form will be sent and the student needs to fill in the form.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/2/24, 6:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/2/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.
2/2/24, 8:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
2/2/24, 8:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us reconnect tomorrow for our session to proceed with the next steps. I wish you a blessed night, Allen!
2/2/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Thank you ma'am.
Goodnight.
3/2/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen. How are you all doing this fine morning?
3/2/24, 9:55 AM - +263 77 810 4432: We're doing alright how are you ma'am
3/2/24, 10:13 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. During our previous conversation, I had informed you that we are ready to proceed with the 2nd step in the admission cycle.
3/2/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday before our session.
3/2/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
3/2/24, 10:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
3/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/2/24, 10:16 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
3/2/24, 10:21 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am.
3/2/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 810 4432: I'm not sure so can I inform you later in the afternoon.
3/2/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am.
3/2/24, 10:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, take today and Sunday's time to go through the tasks, and we will reconnect on Monday at our scheduled time to proceed with our discussion. I hope by then you will be able to complete the tasks. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
3/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.
3/2/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Enjoy your weekend.
5/2/24, 3:18 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I hope you all had a great weekend. How is everything on your end today?
6/2/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen. I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response from your end yesterday, however it seems like due to some reason we were not able to connect with each other. May I know if everything is well on your end?
6/2/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am
Sorry for not responding yesterday my phone wasn't working so I had to get it fixed but it's alright now.
6/2/24, 4:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know if you were able to complete the tasks that I had shared with you on Saturday?
6/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I'm not yet finished ma'am but I'm almost finished.
6/2/24, 4:56 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Since my operational hours are about to end soon, kindly complete the tasks and share them here on the group by the end of day today.

I will be concluding our conversation here, and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to proceed with our discussion. Have a blessed day ahead!
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I hope you are having a lovely day. How are things with you today?
7/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 810 4432: 2. The law of thermodynamics elaborates on the physical quantities like radiation, temperature and entropy governed by the thermodynamic system at thermal equilibrium. Thermodynamic laws don't consider the particular characteristics of heat transference at the molecular or atomic level; instead they deal with the whole of energy and heat changes within a structure.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics:
This law explains that when two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object they are likewise in thermodynamic equilibrium.

The first law of thermodynamics:
There are only two possible outcomes when one adds heat to a system, either it changes the system's internal energy or makes the system work.Therefore the first law is considered a cornerstone of the idea of energy.

The second law of thermodynamics:
It's states that nature forbids humans from achieving particular results without investing much effort.As such it is strongly related to energy conservation.This law states that no heat engine or comparable device subject to the laws of thermodynamics is ever completely efficient.

The third law of thermodynamics:
As per the third law it is possible to establish an absolute temperature scale, with absolute zero being the location where a solid's internal energy equals exactly zero.
To gradually comprehend the third law we can use steam as an example. It's molecules are very entropic and mobile.Lowering the temperature below 100°C causes the steam to turn into water where the mobility of molecules is constrained and the entropy of water is reduced.
Examples of thermodynamics;
The second rule of thermodynamics is the foundation upon which various forms of vehicles including  ships trucks and planes, operate.
It serves as the foundation for the three types of heat transport. Coolers, radiators and heaters frequently use the notions of heat transfer.
7/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 810 4432: 3.A valve is a device or natural object that regulates directs or controls the flow of a fluid( gases, liquids and or fluidized solids) by opening, closing or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings but are usually discussed as a separate category.
Butterfly Valves are used to regulate or isolate the flow of different type of fluid, gas or solid material and they have applications across several industries.
Butterfly Valves may be used for intercepting liquids when a hermetic seal,low pressure losses and compact construction in the flow direction are required.
7/2/24, 3:38 PM - +263 77 810 4432: 4.What is heat treatment and why it's done?

-it is a series of operations involving heating and cooling of metal in solid state
-its purpose is to change mechanical properties or combination of mechanical properties so that the metal will be more useful ,serviceable and safe for a definate purpose.
-by heat treating ,a metal can be harder ,stronger and more resistant to impact,heat treatment can also make metal softer and more ductile.
-based on the range of tempretures cooling process and properties enhancement can be divided into many types which include:-

NORMALIZING- heat the steel from 30 to 50 degrees celcius ,above  it's upper critical temperature  ,held  about fifteen minutes and allowed to cool down in still air
-the homogeneous structure provides a higher yield point ,ultimate tensile strength and impact strength with lower ductility to steels
MAIN OBJECTIVES:
-refine grain ,improve mechinability,tensile strength and structure of weld
-remove cold worked stress
-remove dislocation due to hot working 

ANNEALING 
- involves heating the steel to a suitable tempreture holding it at that tempreture for sometime and then cooling it afterwards.
-they are different ways  of cooling .
-the  main purpose of annealing is to reduce hardness of material 
-besides this it is also used to:- relieve the internal stress of a material 
-restore ductility to perform  further operation on the material 
- induce softness 

HARDENING
-Its a process in which steel is heated  30-50 degrees Celsius above critical range 
-soaking time is allowed to enable the steel to obtain a uniform tempreture throughout its cross section. Then steel is rapidly cooled through medium 
-Hardening increase brittleness in a metal

TEMPERING
-it is a heat-treatment process in which the hardness of a hardened alloy is reduced by the appropriate heat-treatment process
-tempering is a heat-treatment process consisting of reheating the hardened steel to a tempreture below 400 degrees celcius followed by  cooling.
7/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: 5.A compressor is a mechanical flowing device designed to increase the pressure of a gas by reducing it's volume. The compressor is the main component of basic refrigeration systems and is often considered as the heart of the cooling system. It works as a pump to control the circulation of the refrigerant.
Types of compressors:
1. Reciprocating gas compressors - it uses pistons and positive displacement to compress the gas.Gas enters the manifold, flows into the compression cylinder, then discharges at a higher pressure. 
2. Centrifugal compressor - Because of their multiphase compression process, centrifugal compressors are able to produce a high amount of energy in a relatively small machine.
3. Axial compressors - They are commonly found in high speed engines on ships and on planes. They have a high efficiency rate.
4. Rotary screw compressor.

The power of gas turbines is proportional to the mass of flow and velocity of the gas passing through the engine. Only axial compressors are able to supply the amount of air to do so while maintain reasonably small diameter of the rotor.
7/2/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the answers with me. May I know if you were also able to complete the 1st question of the 2nd task and the SOP form as well?
7/2/24, 3:46 PM - +263 77 810 4432: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I'm not yet done with the 1st question I'll send the audio when I get to a quiet place.
7/2/24, 4:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing your answers and screenshot with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
7/2/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am
7/2/24, 4:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/2/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am it's accurate.
7/2/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
7/2/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
7/2/24, 4:42 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
7/2/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
7/2/24, 5:36 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
7/2/24, 5:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As much as I would like to continue with our discussion, my operational hours have already concluded. Hence, let us conclude our conversation here and we will reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to proceed with our discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan. 

Have a blessed evening!
7/2/24, 7:57 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Thank you ma'am
8/2/24, 4:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I hope you are all doing wonderful today. How has your day been going so far?
8/2/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am we're doing alright how are you.
8/2/24, 4:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing good, thank you for asking. During our previous discussion, we were talking about the Financial Secure Plan. Now that you have gone through the points that I had previously shared with you, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
8/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am.
8/2/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in February 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
8/2/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
8/2/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
8/2/24, 5:59 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
9/2/24, 2:20 PM - +263 77 810 4432: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 4:04 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I hope you are doing well today. How has your day been going so far?
9/2/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Good afternoon ma'am.
9/2/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your answer for the 1st question of the Academic Interview Questionnaire. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to proceed with the same -
9/2/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am
9/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
9/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
9/2/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
9/2/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yeah ma'am.
9/2/24, 6:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
9/2/24, 6:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
9/2/24, 6:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
9/2/24, 6:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
9/2/24, 6:07 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
9/2/24, 6:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to continue with our discussion, however, as my operational hours have come to an end, let's conclude our conversation here. We will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. Our operational hours for tomorrow (Saturday) are from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. I hope you'll be available during this time for further discussion.

I will look forward to our session tomorrow. Have a blessed night!
9/2/24, 6:46 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.
Have a blessed night also.
10/2/24, 1:06 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen.

I trust you are having a delightful weekend. On this pleasant Saturday afternoon, I hope you are presently available for a discussion. Before we begin, I would like to check in and ask how are things with you today?
10/2/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am
10/2/24, 3:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I hope everything is well on your end. During our previous session, we were discussing about the various constraints that the students and their parents tend to face while planning for their education abroad. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
10/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am please do explain
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off $150 from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
10/2/24, 3:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
10/2/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am why?
12/2/24, 7:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen.

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your last message, as our operational hours had concluded by then. Before we proceed with our session for today, I would like to inquire how everything is on your end today?
12/2/24, 8:40 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Everything is ok on our end ma'am .
I hope you enjoyed your weekend.
12/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I had a good weekend, thank you for asking Allen. During our previous session, we were discussing about how the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan works. Allow me to continue with our discussion -
12/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
12/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
12/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
12/2/24, 8:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
12/2/24, 10:26 AM - +263 77 810 4432: That's great ma'am.
12/2/24, 10:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
12/2/24, 10:56 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
12/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
12/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
12/2/24, 11:09 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
12/2/24, 11:11 AM - +263 77 810 4432: It sounds great ma'am.
12/2/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
12/2/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am I understood it.
12/2/24, 12:19 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
12/2/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I'll do it tonight ma'am.
12/2/24, 12:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
12/2/24, 1:00 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.

19/2/24, 12:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Allen,

I hope you are doing great. May I know the reason behind your absence at the seminar? <This message was edited>
19/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 77 810 4432: My mum was not around so I had noone to take me there and also didn't have money to do the printouts.
19/2/24, 1:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know if you could not have attended the event alone?
19/2/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ma'am sorry may you please resend this message.

I hope you are all doing great. It has been a while since we last connected, and our team has had quite hectic past few days. As you already know, over the past three days, Team Edoofa has been bustling with activity – both in India and Harare for the Meet and Greet '24. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

26/2/24, 10:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Over the weekend, our team engaged in discussions regarding the Meet and Greet Seminar, reflecting on the valuable insights gained from interacting with our students. The experience was truly enriching for us, and we hope it was equally enjoyable for you as well.

Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to inquire how you are doing this fine morning?
26/2/24, 11:08 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Im doing alright ma'am thank you.
How are you doing?
26/2/24, 11:21 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
26/2/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 810 4432: No ma'am I'm not familiar with it.
26/2/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
26/2/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
26/2/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
26/2/24, 12:07 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when he comes to India.

26/2/24, 12:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
26/2/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ma'am I went through the messages, pictures and videos.
26/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Allen. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
26/2/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am we were able to discuss about it. She actually thought it was a good idea, but the only problem is she won't be able to get $150 to deposit  every month.
26/2/24, 1:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. If I may ask, is there any particular reason due to which it will not be feasible for you?
26/2/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 810 4432: She doesn't get her pay at the end of the month, maybe after 2 months or so.
26/2/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I could not quite understand, Allen. Are you saying that she will not be receiving her salary for the next 2 months?
26/2/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Kind of. My mum is a supplier, she supplies things like computer consumables and hardware so the companies that she supplies to usually pay her in 2 months time or more.
26/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I know if it will be possible for you to make $300 deposits in every 2 months?
26/2/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 810 4432: I don't know ma'am. Is it ok if I ask her first and tell you tomorrow.
27/2/24, 12:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen,

I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond to your message yesterday as I was not feeling well. I am pleased to let you know that I am doing better today and eager to proceed with our discussion. May I know if you were able to discuss the matter with your mother yesterday?
28/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am, sorry for not responding yesterday.
28/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 77 810 4432: So um my mum had a question, she wanted to ask if it's a must to deposit the money for the next ten months or if it's optional because she's afraid of failing to keep the promise of depositing $150 a month.
28/2/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you're having a lovely morning. The plan is not compulsory, instead, it has been provided to you to ensure that we are able to consistently save in small amounts towards your higher education funds. As you might be aware, we will be processing your profile under early applications for the 2025 intake. In such a case, the registration fees due towards securing the scholarship seat will be due in the month of August. We want to ensure that you do not face any last minute burdens due to the finances. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is flexible, and if you wish to make alterations to it, kindly feel free to suggest the same. Our end goal is to ensure that we are able to save $1500 towards your education by the end of November. I hope we are together in this?
28/2/24, 11:49 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am I'm following.
28/2/24, 12:57 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that we are on the same page here. In such a case, could you kindly discuss the same with your parents and let me know how they plan on going ahead with the Financial Secure Plan?
28/2/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am I will.
28/2/24, 12:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you kindly let me know by when you will be able to have this discussion with your family and share the same with me?
28/2/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Right now I'm at school so we will have this discussion tonight and I'll tell u tomorrow.
28/2/24, 1:54 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. In such a case, let us conclude our discussion here, and we will reconnect tomorrow to proceed with our discussions. Hopefully, you will be able to have a fruitful discussion with your family. Kindly feel free to reach out to me on the group if you have any queries.

Have a blessed day ahead, Allen!
28/2/24, 2:34 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am .
29/2/24, 11:22 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you are having a pleasant day. I am reaching out to inquire if you were able to have the discussion regarding a suitable approach for the Financial Secure Plan?
29/2/24, 11:44 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am.
29/2/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes I was able to discuss it with her.
29/2/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 810 4432: She said she can raise the $1500 by November.
29/2/24, 1:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you will be able to prepare for the same. In such a case, may I know if you were able to decide on how you plan on moving forward with the Financial Secure Plan and what is the deposit amount that will be feasible for you?
29/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 810 4432: No we didn't discuss that.
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Could you kindly share how your discussion went and what were your thoughts during the discussion?
29/2/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok so mum was thinking of just depositing the $1500 in November without having to deposit per month.
29/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Financial Secure Plan is a tailored financial strategy designed to assist students and their families. Drawing from over 15 years of experience, during which we've supported thousands of students in their higher education pursuits, we recognize the significance of early financial planning, not only for education but also for various life aspects. I am sure that you agree that sometimes unforeseen situations arise that cause hindrance in our plannings. <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As a financial benefit, upon successfully completing the first 10 months of the plan, you'll receive a $150 waiver along with a compounding bonus. Considering your situation, do you believe this plan could offer more benefits compared to saving independently?
29/2/24, 5:16 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 9:58 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you are having a pleasant morning. I am glad to know that we are on the same page here, Allen. Certainly, you have the option to save independently. However, wouldn't it be more advantageous for you to maximize your savings by participating in the Financial Secure Plan as well?
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - +263 77 810 4432: It wld be
1/3/24, 10:21 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Good morning
1/3/24, 10:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Allen. In such a case, I urge you to reconsider the benefits of the Financial Secure Plan, and how they can help you maximize your savings in the most efficient manner, and discuss it with your family.
1/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am
1/3/24, 10:27 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is important that you are able to weigh in all the factors that are related to the Financial Secure Plan and then make an informed decision.
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am.
1/3/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I urge you to have a detailed discussion with your family by discussing all the benefits and aspects of the Financial Secure Plan. As your admission officer, I do not want you to miss out on this amazing opportunity where you can make savings while saving for your higher education funds. If you have any query or concern at any point, whether it is regarding the amount or the duration, I request you to kindly share the same with me here on the group. If you wish to connect over a call with me for more clarification, kindly let me know and I will arrange for the same. I hope we are on the same page here, Allen?
1/3/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us conclude our discussion here for today. I hope that you are able to have a fruitful discussion with your family and help them understand the various benefits of the Financial Secure Plan that can help you with maximizing the savings for your higher education funds.

4/3/24, 3:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen,

I hope you are having a wonderful day. How are things on your end today?
4/3/24, 7:36 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am
5/3/24, 9:31 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you are doing well. How has your day been so far?
5/3/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Good morning ma'am
We're doing alright thanks and how are you.
5/3/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. I am doing well, thank you for asking. May I know if you and your family were able to have a discussion regarding the Financial Secure Plan and understand how it is going to help you maximize your savings by giving you a direct benefit of $150 along with compound bonus? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am we discussed about it.
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. What were your thoughts during the discussion and how did it go?
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 810 4432: The Financial Secure Plan is a perfect plan it comes with many benefits but I think mum wants to save independently.
5/3/24, 10:14 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. That is also completely alright. Could you kindly share as to why your mother thinks it is better to save independently? I am a bit confused with your decision and understanding your thought process better will help us in being on the same page.
5/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok so my mum isn't sure if she'll be able to deposit money every month.
5/3/24, 10:26 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, may I know how you plan on proceeding with the savings considering your registration amount of $500 to $1000 will be due in the month of August?
6/3/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Not yet sure on how she'll be saving.
6/3/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am.
6/3/24, 12:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Allen,

I hope you are having a lovely day. I understand please. However, I would like to discuss the significance of planning ahead, particularly regarding the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Given that this amount is relatively substantial, it's crucial to begin planning for it now to avoid any potential difficulties in the future. Would you agree with this perspective?
6/3/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am I agree.
6/3/24, 12:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Surely. In such a case, I urge you to have a detailed discussion with your family regarding how you plan on saving and financing for your higher education. Having clarity this early on will help you in planning your way forward more efficiently and will prevent any last moment stress. Do you agree with this, Blessing?
6/3/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am
6/3/24, 12:50 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you agree and to see your dedication. Kindly have a discussion with your family and let me know once you are able to decide on something. We can discuss and further plan together on how to move forward with it. By when do you think you will be able to have this discussion, Allen? <This message was edited>

6/3/24, 12:52 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I hope that you are able to have a fruitful discussion with your family. Let us reconnect tomorrow to discuss our way forward.

I wish you and your family a blessed day ahead!
6/3/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Ok ma'am thank you.
11/3/24, 8:08 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Hello ma'am
12/3/24, 9:43 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Allen,

I hope you are having a good day. How have you all been doing?
12/3/24, 9:50 AM - +263 77 810 4432: We have been doing alright ma'am.
How have you been?
12/3/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you for asking. So, how is everything on your end? Were you able to discuss the matter at hand with your family, Allen?
12/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am.
12/3/24, 1:37 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Can you share with me how the discussion went and what you have been able to decide?
12/3/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 810 4432: She said she'll be saving $500 every 2months.
12/3/24, 3:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Allen. That is amazing to hear! I am glad that you were able to have this discussion with you mother.

I would also like to share an update with you. As you may recall, we recently conducted the Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare where over 2700 attended. Many of the students expressed their interest in joining the Edoofa program and coming to India next year after understanding the impact Edoofa can have on their educational journey. Most of them recognized the benefits of enrolling in the Financial Secure Plan and how it can help them maximize their savings in a timely manner.
12/3/24, 3:34 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Given the limited number of seats available and the high demand for enrollment, it's essential to complete the formalities within the designated timeline. Since I introduced the plan to you before many others, I wanted to ensure that you are able to secure your seat if you wish to. In such a case, I wanted to confirm whether your decision has not changed? <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 3:36 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Yes ma'am my decision hasn't changed.
12/3/24, 3:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I respect your decision. However, I have a challenge understanding a few aspects of our discussion. Could you kindly help me out with the same?
12/3/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 810 4432: Which aspects ma'am.
12/3/24, 4:41 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Earlier you had mentioned that your mother was under the impression that she will not be able to make the monthly deposits. However, I am now glad to know that she says that she will be able to save $500 every 2 months. In such a case, could you kindly help me understand the reasoning behind your decision to not participate in the Financial Secure Plan? I am asking because understanding this will help us to be on the same page.
