I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

14/2/24, 11:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Duly Noted!
29/2/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tinotenda,

Here at Edoofa, we're brimming with energy and excitement, all thanks to the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools in Harare last week.

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. But before I delve into the details of our experiences and the opportunities that await you and your family, I want to take a moment to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. Your support means the world to us.
29/2/24, 5:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, inspired by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.

In light of this, I am  also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and what resonated with you the most during the seminar?
29/2/24, 5:53 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Greetings
How are you Ms. Siddhi Singh ?

I will be very delighted to share with you my experience at the Meet and Greet '24. 

I had the privilege to hear directly from the founder of the Organization, Mr. Singh. He explained the huge benefits of studying in India and he also brought with him most of the senior members of the Organization. Thus, we had a chance to see them face to face unlike just talking to them on the phone as we did previously. I was also inspired by the videos of EDOOFIANs enjoying their study in India through the EDOOFA program. In a nutshell, the event removed all the doubt l had about the program and now l fully believe in it's purpose and benefits.
Another exciting thing is that l had a just to take a photo with Mr. Singh himself. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 12:00 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Roy,

I hope you all had a wonderful weekend. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. I am pleased to hear that all your doubts and queries were cleared, and that you are now more inspired by our Edoofians to commence your higher education journey. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
4/3/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Good Afternoon to you, Ms. Siddhi Singh.

I have to say that l don't have the right count about the number of attendees but l will be glad if you were to enlighten me on that. Also a point of correction, my name is Tinotenda not Roy. 
Thank you very much
4/3/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the error, Tinotenda. Since I am currently conversing with multiple students, I happened to make a typing error.

Tinotenda, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the directors of Edoofa.
4/3/24, 12:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As you may recall from the seminar, you're one of the proud Edoofians who has completed the admission process, leaving only the finalization of the university and the commencement of the visa application process. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 12:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To provide you with a recap of our discussions during the seminar:

Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've been diligently working on your scholarship application to help you secure offer letters from various universities in India, giving you multiple options to choose from. Currently, you've received an offer letter from MVN University, and by the 15th of March, you can expect to receive the remaining offer letters as well.
4/3/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you receive the offer letters, you'll have the privilege of comparing them and selecting the university that aligns best with your educational goals. Should you decide to change your university choice, you can do so with the transfer option, and any registration fees you've already paid will be adjusted accordingly.

Following the university selection, the next step will be to commence your visa application process, which will take place in April 2024l. Our Department of Student Welfare will be in touch with you to guide you through this process.
4/3/24, 12:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the meantime, it's essential to focus on your EWYL Program and ensure you stay connected with your mentor to upskill yourself. In case you have any queries that you would like to discuss, you can feel free to reach out to us here in your admission group and we will get back to you within the next 24 hours.
4/3/24, 12:29 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Very much Noted, l will surely reach out to you whenever a question or query arise

Once again, Thank you very much
4/3/24, 12:43 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are most welcome, please. I wish you a blessed week ahead and kindly extend my regards to your family as well!
4/3/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Okay, thank you
11/3/24, 3:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope you are keeping well. Mr. Anik reached out to me regarding some concern that you have. I had previously reached out to you and shared that we are expecting to receive more letters for your application by 15th March, after which we will commence your Visa process in the month of April. May I know if you have any concerns or queries regarding the same?
11/3/24, 4:07 PM - +263 78 972 4211: Greetings
