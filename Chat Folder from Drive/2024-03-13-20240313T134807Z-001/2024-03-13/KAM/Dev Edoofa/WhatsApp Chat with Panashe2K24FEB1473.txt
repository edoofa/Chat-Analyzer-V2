5/3/24, 9:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
5/3/24, 9:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Panashe 2K24FEB1473*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
5/3/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Panashe EWYL23E1339* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
5/3/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ik
5/3/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/3/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 704 5451: noted
5/3/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 9:29 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
5/3/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/3/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/3/24, 9:31 AM - +263 71 704 5451: done
5/3/24, 9:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
5/3/24, 9:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in August.

I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 9:33 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes im following
5/3/24, 9:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 9:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
5/3/24, 9:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 704 5451: lets begin
5/3/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/3/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/3/24, 9:43 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
5/3/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

5/3/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

7/3/24, 10:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have connected with your EWYL mentor and I truly believe that you are going to be able to learn more and more skills so that you are employable-ready when you finish with your tertiary education.
7/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok thank you sir
7/3/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
7/3/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/3/24, 10:09 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
7/3/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom. and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
7/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 71 704 5451: thats it
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
7/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
7/3/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
7/3/24, 10:31 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 10:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
7/3/24, 10:37 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
7/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
7/3/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
7/3/24, 10:41 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
7/3/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
7/3/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
7/3/24, 10:47 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
7/3/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
7/3/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
7/3/24, 10:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
7/3/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
7/3/24, 10:49 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of *March 22, 2024*.
7/3/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
7/3/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
7/3/24, 10:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
7/3/24, 10:57 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 11:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
7/3/24, 11:52 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
7/3/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
7/3/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
7/3/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Are you still available, Panashe?
7/3/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 12:34 PM - +263 71 704 5451: yes
7/3/24, 12:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Panashe. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
7/3/24, 12:39 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
7/3/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
8/3/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well. I was hoping for a response from your side. Please let us know if you are facing any challenges.
8/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 71 704 5451: morning please help to understand on this: earlier you mentioned that the fee to be paid after being granted a scholarship will range between 2000 - 3000 yet l was told that on it will range between 1200- 1800 on the acceptance letter
8/3/24, 9:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Panashe, the tuition fees is going to be $1200-1800 as mentioned in the acceptance letter. It was an example to help you understand the workings of the Financial Secure Plan. So no need to worry. But you also need to consider the scholarship is granted on the tuition fees only. I hope I was able to clear your query?
8/3/24, 9:08 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok can please explain more on the food and accommodation expenses
8/3/24, 9:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Generally, Edoofians are offered acceptance later with a fee range of $2000-3000, but since your counselor has thoroughly gone through your application and recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship, i.e. $1200-1800. In this fee range, the food and accommodation are covered as well. I hope you understand now?
8/3/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes thank you
8/3/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome! Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
8/3/24, 9:42 AM - +263 71 704 5451: im not
8/3/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
8/3/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
8/3/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8/3/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that you too would be this excited to attend such events when you come to India.
8/3/24, 9:45 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes

8/3/24, 9:45 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
8/3/24, 9:51 AM - +263 71 704 5451: yes i can see that
8/3/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Certainly, Panashe. Also, regarding the discussion we had yesterday about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
8/3/24, 9:53 AM - +263 71 704 5451: everything went smoothly we can proceed
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Panashe. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. 

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of March, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
8/3/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

8/3/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.
8/3/24, 7:41 PM - +263 71 704 5451: is it possible to deposit to just pay it at once
9/3/24, 8:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well. I was not able to reply to you as our operational hours were over at the time you replied. Regarding your query, you can surely pay it at once, but you need to understand that the Financial Secure Plan, helps parents to prepare the finances required for a student's tertiary education in a better way. Along with this plan, you will be able to avail great benefits that are only offered with this plan. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
9/3/24, 9:42 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
11/3/24, 9:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well and had a peaceful weekend. May I know if you as a family were able to discuss the benefits of the financial secure plan? Please let us know if you have any queries regarding the same. We are more than happy to help you out.
11/3/24, 10:03 AM - +263 71 704 5451: morning
11/3/24, 10:03 AM - +263 71 704 5451: we discussed the matter and my family is willing to pay it all in November
11/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Panashe. May I know if there is any specific reason that you have decided to pay all in November?
11/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 71 704 5451: it will be difficult for them to deposit 150 due to many things that needs attention such as school fees for me and my siblings.food and others .they are promising to have all the ready by November
11/3/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Panashe. But you need to understand the admission processes for the year 2025 are going to commence from, August 2024. When you will receive the offer letter, your parents will have to pay $500-$1000 registration fees within 15 days of receiving it, which is a hefty amount to pay in one go. This means your parents will have to pay the registration fee in August and not in November. So may I know if you have thought of this perspective?
11/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok i haven't thougt of it
11/3/24, 10:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: It's alright, Panashe. I also wanted to help you understand, that 20-30% of students who enroll in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, every year are unable to come to India due to poor preparation of Finances. To solve this recurrence, Edoofa designed the Edoofa Secure Plan to ensure that students should not be able to let go of the golden opportunity to grow just because of poor preparation of finances. I understand the financial constraints that you may have in the future, but I also believe that your parents want you to become a successful individual in your respective field of study and moreover, life. The purpose of this plan is to help the parents save $1500 at the end of 10 months, i.e. January. This will greatly help the parents to ensure that their children can grab seats before other students as well as help the parents to prepare for the finances for the whole year and, not to forget the added benefits that were mentioned above.
11/3/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Considering this, I would like you to discuss the financial secure plan with your family factoring the above points?
11/3/24, 11:01 AM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
11/3/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
11/3/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok
12/3/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!

12/3/24, 1:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Panashe. But you need to take note that if you choose to pay in August the whole amount, you will not be able to avail of the beneficial aspects of the Financial Secure Plan which includes the $150 waiver. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey?
12/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 704 5451: ok

12/3/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 704 5451: the financial secure plan is an efficient one but we are finding it difficulty to follow as we have to pay 150 this month and remaining balance of admission also this month and the other expenses to cater for at home
12/3/24, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern, Panashe, and the challenges you are facing this month. I discussed this with the academic board as well and they provided us with a solution that you can start with the Financial Secure Plan from the month of April as well.
