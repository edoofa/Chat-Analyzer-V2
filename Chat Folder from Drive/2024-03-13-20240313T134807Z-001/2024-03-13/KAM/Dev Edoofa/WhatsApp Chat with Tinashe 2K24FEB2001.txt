11/3/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
11/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 437 3145: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tinashe 2K24FEB2001)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
11/3/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tinashe EWYL23E1359)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
11/3/24, 2:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing! I have taken note of it. <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 437 3145: Thank you sir.
11/3/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 437 3145: We can start.
11/3/24, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 437 3145: I have read we can proceed
11/3/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/3/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
11/3/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 437 3145: Yes sir.understood
11/3/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
11/3/24, 2:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
11/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 437 3145: OK understood
11/3/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/3/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/3/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 437 3145: Yes Mr Kumar
11/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 437 3145: Noted.
11/3/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 437 3145: There is clarity of Edoofians as we see vedios of students who are learning in colleges and universities in lndia.This is good because it shows transparency and reality
11/3/24, 2:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Surely, @263714373145. Let me share the videos.
11/3/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/3/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
11/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 437 3145: OK sir
11/3/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

11/3/24, 2:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*
