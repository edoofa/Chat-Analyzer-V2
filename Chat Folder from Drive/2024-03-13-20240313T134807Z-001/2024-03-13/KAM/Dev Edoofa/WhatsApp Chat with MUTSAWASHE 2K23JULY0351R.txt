16/1/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mutsawashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
