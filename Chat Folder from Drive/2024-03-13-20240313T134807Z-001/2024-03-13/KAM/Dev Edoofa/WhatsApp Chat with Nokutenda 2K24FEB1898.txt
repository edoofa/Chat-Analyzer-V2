I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the filled-out forms with us. I have taken complete note of these forms. However, I noticed that you have mentioned the orientation date to be 8th March, but as mentioned in our previous conversation, Nokutenda's EWYL initiation date is 12th March. So I would like you to overwrite the wrong date as 12th March on the EWYL form. I hope you have taken note of it?

7/3/24, 9:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome.  Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
7/3/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Nokutenda 2K24FEB1898*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
7/3/24, 9:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Nokutenda EWYL23E1369* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
7/3/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Noted Sir
7/3/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Noted
7/3/24, 9:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/3/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Lets continue
7/3/24, 9:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 9:58 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Lets discuss
7/3/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/3/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
7/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 77 405 3320: So the SOP, will it be in the form of an essay?
7/3/24, 10:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: The SOP is going to be in the form of an online Google form. Also, Mr. & Mrs. Chinyani, I wanted to let you know that all of the doubts related to the steps being mentioned will be cleared out as soon as we reach that step. This is to ensure that you are not confused due a lot of information being conveyed to you. I hope you understand?
7/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Understood
7/3/24, 10:07 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Noted
7/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
7/3/24, 10:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
7/3/24, 10:10 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Noted,and step 3 a crucial step indeed
7/3/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Noted
7/3/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Chinyani. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated via the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Noted
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Noted
7/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Well explained
7/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Very cleary spelt Sir
7/3/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Continue
7/3/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 405 1656: Lets proceed
7/3/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
7/3/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
7/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 405 3320: Continue
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 405 1656: proceed
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
7/3/24, 10:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. <This message was edited>

One of the most pressing challenges we have in Zimbabwe is lack of access to modern technologies and infrastructure. another challenge is the lack of skilled professionals in the field of electronics and communication engineering which makes the country's development to be backward. As an engineer l would engage in entrepreneurial ventures such that l would partner with big companies such as the Dell India to revive the electronics and communication engineering industry in Zimbabwe. Another challenge we face is poor network reception, therefore in chosen line of work l can contribute to infrastructure  such as telecommunications systems, satellite communications and wireless networks to support the network connectivity.

My dream company l would like to work for is Samsung electronics. Samsung electronics has a significant global presence. The company has a wide range of industrial electronic equipment which are well advanced and are user convenient. It is my dream company because it has a commitment in innovation, product quality and is a major player in the field of electronics engineering.

  Electronics refers to the branch of engineering and phy5 that deals with the study, design and application of electronic circuits, components and systems. While an electric system refers to a collection of interconnected electronic components, devices and circuits that work together. Electronics is the broader field that encompass the study and application of electronic components while an electric system refers to a specific arrangement of these components and circuits working together to perform a particular task or function 
5 *Explain how a* *capacitor  works* 
A capacitor is an electrical component cable of storing energy in the form of an electric charge. It consists of two  metal plates separated by an insulating material called die electric. When a potential difference is applied across the capacitor, one plate accumulates positive charge while the other accumulates negative charge. This creates an electric field between the plates that allow to store energy.
