5/3/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for giving a detailed introduction of yourself and your family. It is commendable to see that you and your husband have been providing unwavering support to your children's education. I must appreciate your transparency in providing the introduction.
5/3/24, 10:04 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
5/3/24, 10:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your husband and Makanaka to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group?
5/3/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok my husband is not on Ap we both use this number and Makanaka is at school right  now when on holiday she uses this number again
5/3/24, 10:09 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I understand. Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team: <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Makanaka 2K24FEB0527)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
5/3/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Makanaka EWYL23E1348)* . In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - +263 78 271 4456: It's very  clear thank you
5/3/24, 10:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward in today's session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Please go on
5/3/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Am done please go on
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/3/24, 10:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps - 

*Step 3: Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan* - Parents with children embarking on their university journey within the next one to two years face important decision-making and rigorous financial planning. Edoofa recognizes the significance of this transition and hence has introduced the Edoofa Secure Plan - a unique and systematic strategy to empower parents in financial planning and preparing for their child's tertiary education well in advance.
5/3/24, 10:22 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Scholarship Offer Letter from the university would be issued next year in the month of August.

I hope you are following?
5/3/24, 10:24 AM - +263 78 271 4456: I am following  shall I share my questions as we go or there shall come a time for questions
5/3/24, 10:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: All of your questions regarding the steps will be cleared when we reach that step, as clearing the doubts right now, will make it more confusing for you to understand the processes in a better way. I hope you understand? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. The registration fee will be paid through the savings you have accumulated visa the Financial Secure Plan. After the registration fee is paid, for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/3/24, 10:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/3/24, 10:33 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Yes
5/3/24, 10:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps if we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/3/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Sure
5/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
5/3/24, 10:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding. Until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Sure let's move forward
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
5/3/24, 10:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
5/3/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
5/3/24, 10:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, and let us know whenever you are done watching the videos. We will move forward with our conversation.
5/3/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 271 4456: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I understand you may take your time till you have a strong network connection.
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
5/3/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
6/3/24, 7:43 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning  am traveling  to the next town so that I get access to strong  internet   yesterday  it did  not work out am sorry
6/3/24, 8:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs. Zimba!
I hope you are doing well. I completely understand the network challenges that you are facing. Let me know whenever you are done watching the videos, so that we can move ahead with our process.
6/3/24, 8:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
6/3/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: Hello Mrs. Zimba!
May I know if you were able to watch the videos that were shared with you?
6/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Good afternoon  yes I did  though  some of them were having a noisy background but I managed gather  some of what was being said
6/3/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! May I know your understanding of the 4 videos?
6/3/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you  from what I managed to gather the founders of Edoofa were saying that  SOP is most important  in that it shows and help people to secure a place at any University it convince  people  so that they see a good reason  to enroll a student they also talked about the issue  of universities that one is left with no doubts  since they engage good  universities they also said that at the end of school one would see the importance of this scholarship  since one would be able to do things on his or her own since skills are being  acquired  one would  be employable and  would  be able to apply skills lastly what I heard they talked about a form in the last video which was said it needed to be filled  without delay but I did not manage to see the form in short this is  what I manged to gather
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Brilliant. I must tell you that you were able to completely feel the essence of the videos and properly grasp the information that was conveyed in those videos.
6/3/24, 2:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose. I hope you were able to follow through with this?
6/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Let's move on
6/3/24, 2:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, it is our responsibility to move Makanaka's application ahead and help Makanaka write a proper statement of purpose so that he/she can get into the best University that provides quality education that leads to a Job. So, for the team to work on Makanaka's  application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Makanka's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Makanaka's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
6/3/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit Makanaka’s responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure to share her inputs and that she has researched well before starting the task. All the best!

6/3/24, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with the tasks?
6/3/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you all is clear as I always say Makanaka is at a boarding school which is far from where I live and at this moment I am not able to reach her and they are not allowed cellphones at school and I am stuck on this one  i need your  help if we can move forward  and when they close  school for holidays she will be able to communicate
6/3/24, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: May I know if you can connect with the school authorities and ask for their permission so that you can connect with her over the phone? This way she will be able to provide the responses to the above tasks.

Keeping in mind, the challenges you are facing in connecting with Makanaka to complete the SOP, we can move ahead with the further steps. Makanaka can complete these tasks when she is at home. Let me know what do you feel about this.'
9/3/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 271 4456: It's ok so thank you
9/3/24, 9:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know. We will have our session at 10:30 am to move forward with the procedure. <This message was edited>
9/3/24, 9:47 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you
9/3/24, 12:53 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Makanaka!
I hope you are doing well. I had to be in an urgent meeting and am still caught up in the meeting, so we will have to shift our session to Monday. We will have our session on Monday at 10:30 AM. I hope you have taken note of it.
9/3/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 271 4456: It's ok thank
9/3/24, 12:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for understanding, Mrs. Zimba. I wish you and your family a blessed weekend.
9/3/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank  you stay well
9/3/24, 1:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
11/3/24, 10:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Zimba!
I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are available to forward our session?
11/3/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning
11/3/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: How are you doing?
11/3/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Fine how are you
11/3/24, 10:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine as well.
11/3/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Nice to know
11/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: We will progress to the third step in your admission journey now, i.e. *Introduction to Financial Secure Plan*.
11/3/24, 10:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we start the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
11/3/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you for the reminder the remaining part will be paid
11/3/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better. 

In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course Makanaka selected for her higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/3/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 271 4456: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 271 4456: The information  is correct
11/3/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
11/3/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
11/3/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
11/3/24, 11:55 AM - +263 78 271 4456: Please go on
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
11/3/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
11/3/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Yaa that is what we had wished for
11/3/24, 12:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
11/3/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Please go on
11/3/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in March 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
11/3/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
11/3/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
11/3/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 271 4456: That's true
11/3/24, 1:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 1:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Mrs. Zimba, may I know if you are facing any challenges in replying? I was observing that it is taking you a lot of time to reply. If you are caught up with something, please let me know, we can schedule our session accordingly.
11/3/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 271 4456: The same  problem with my network  at times ti takes long am sorry
11/3/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Zimba. May I know if you are available now?
11/3/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 271 4456: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 271 4456: At the moment  it's up
11/3/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Let's continue
11/3/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know! Now continuing our conversation, following the above example, by the time Makanaka would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
11/3/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
11/3/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
11/3/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Am following  thank you
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 271 4456: This is proving to be an eye opener
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
11/3/24, 1:35 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
11/3/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Very correct
11/3/24, 1:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
11/3/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Please do
11/3/24, 1:46 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date of *March 15, 2024*.
11/3/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
11/3/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
11/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Yes
11/3/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
11/3/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
11/3/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
11/3/24, 1:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
11/3/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 271 4456: I think this is a good thing on the part of the parents
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
11/3/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Yes
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Was still reading
11/3/24, 2:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
11/3/24, 2:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Those messages were supposed to be sent to some other student, but there was genuine mistake from my side, and sent here. I hope you understand?
11/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok
11/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Good
11/3/24, 2:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you understand the financial secure plan now?
11/3/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you am very much helped
11/3/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.
11/3/24, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
11/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you Me Kumar with all this information and thank you for giving me time to discuss with my family  is it ok if we can resume tomorrow  since everyone is at work we meet in the evening with the family  then we resume tomorrow  sametime
11/3/24, 2:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine, Mrs. Zimba. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
11/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
11/3/24, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
12/3/24, 12:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mrs. Zimba!
Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
12/3/24, 12:37 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Good afternoon  yes am ready
12/3/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held in January, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
12/3/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Please explain  it to me
12/3/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
12/3/24, 12:40 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/3/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of the conference with you and your family. I am certain that Makanaka too would be this excited to attend such events when she comes to India. <This message was edited>

This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable-ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
12/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok I went through  them only that they took long to open I think my network  is slow
12/3/24, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Zimba. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
12/3/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you very much yes we did and there are  a few questions  which were raised  I explained but I think you can help again to explain 
1.  There is the issue of financial planning it was said that there is need to pay $150 for 20 months so in which account is the money deposited into

2. What happens if I skip or if I don't pay on a monthly basis 
3. This 150 per month  if I am correct is the way of saving the fees that is the 2000-3000
12/3/24, 2:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mrs. Zimba, surely we can help you out with it. 

1. First of all if you need to understand that in financial secure plan, you must deposit $150 for 10 months. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
       Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process.     The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. 
Now, from the 14th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.
12/3/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 2:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: 3. Yes, the $150 per month is the correct way of saving for $2000-3000.
12/3/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: I hope I was able to clear your queries?
12/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you  very much so though  it's a way of saving is there a follow up  from your said or it's me who is supposed to know that I have to pay  what happens  if I skip a month
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: No need to worry about that, Mrs. Zimba, we are surely going to take a follow up from you and send gentle reminders as well regarding the deadline dates.
12/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok it was still downloading  so you mean there is a penalty fee why  paying penalty  fee since the saving is to my advantage
12/3/24, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: The penalty fee is there to ensure there are timely deposits for the installments of the financial secure plan, to make sure there is consistency, and parents can save the amounts at the right time. As mentioned before, if you think you are facing challenges in deposition of installment on time, you can surely discuss this issue with us, we would love to help you out with it.
12/3/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank  if there  are other questions  I will share them with you
12/3/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, please share all of the questions you have by today, so that we can start preparing for the Financial Secure agreement. I hope you understand?
