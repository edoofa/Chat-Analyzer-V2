 Just a recap.

in terms of costs for the first semester and traveling we  left with:

Tuition bal.                   150
Visa application abt.    83
On campus accom abt2k
Air ticket          abt.      450
11/3/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Sure, @263772233391! Let me help you with it. 

The tuition fee per annum is $1800. Out of which, you have paid $750. Now the remaining balance is $1050. Now, you have to pay $525 before arriving in India. For this, you have an option to pay in monthly installments as well. 

Visa Application is $83.

On campus, accommodation for 3-seater AC is $2000 and 2-seater AC is $2500. However, we would recommend you the off campus accommodation, i.e. which will cost you around $800. This will include food, wifi, and basic facilities. 

Air tickets completely depend on the timeline at which you are booking the tickets. The air tickets usually cost around $450-$500.
11/3/24, 3:56 PM - Transnational auto: Noted. When are we likely to start the Visa application process. Also to note is that we've only received the offer later and is clearly indicated that "this is not for visa application."


So now they are some changes to the initial agreement confirm.

We were to believe that Tuition is  1800/ year.
Wich further reduces to 900/semester and we're asked to pay 750 upfront bal per first semester was 150 check from the previous correspondence.
11/3/24, 3:59 PM - Transnational auto: [3/9, 13:34] Transnational auto: Ok. Noted. So you recon since we have paid the 750 deposit already now we can finish off the 150 balance of tuition  share the copy here then we wait for your guidance on Visa applications, boarding and others.
[3/9, 13:37] +91 96505 37098: Absolutely right dear

This was between me Mrs Ashi
11/3/24, 4:10 PM - Dev Edoofa: Ms. Ashi has guided you in the right way, @263772233391. The remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. Now, out of the $1800, you have paid $750. The remaining fee left is $1050. Now this amount divided into two installments is $525 each.
Now, as you said the $150 balance of tuition fee that you will pay is out of the $525. After paying, $150 the remaining amount left to pay will be $375.
11/3/24, 4:13 PM - Dev Edoofa: Regarding the offer letter, it needs to be noted that we have not started with the visa application process yet because we can move ahead with it only after you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL). You will receive AAL only after you have finalized the university. I hope I was able to clear your queries? <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 4:24 PM - Transnational auto: This message was deleted
11/3/24, 4:31 PM - Transnational auto: NO.

We have since been offered a play at Galgotias and made all necessary requested pymnts towards the same meaning our choice and finalisation there.


Regarding 1800 fees *AFTER* arriving  in India it comprises what and what if I may ask
11/3/24, 4:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, you were offered an offer letter from Galgotias, but since you have only received it from Galgotias and not from other universities, we would like you to wait till you receive the offer letter from other universities as well. We have sent your application to different universities including LPU as well which is one of the top universities in India, so we are waiting for you to receive the offer letter from there. However, if you have made up your mind, to opt for Galgotias, you can surely go ahead with it. 

Regarding the $1800 fee, before arriving in India, you have to pay $525. And after arriving in India, you have to pay $525 in January 2025. 
I hope I am clear now.
11/3/24, 5:57 PM - +263 71 385 1617: Good evening Mr Dev Kumar let's say I have finalized that i want galgotias what shall i do
12/3/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263713851617!
I hope you are doing well. I was not able to reply to your query as our operational hours for the day were over. I hope you understand.
Now, if you finalize Galgotias, your AAL is in process with the Galgotias University and as soon as it is processed, we will start with the visa process.
12/3/24, 8:52 AM - +263 71 385 1617: Yes thank you I chose GALGOTIAS as for my university
12/3/24, 8:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, your application for AAL is already in process, as soon as we get any update from the university, we will provide you with the update.
12/3/24, 8:56 AM - +263 71 385 1617: Thank you Mr Dev Kumar I really appreciate and I can't wait
12/3/24, 9:02 AM - Transnational auto: Good morning Mr Dev Kumar. I, Albert Mubaiwa as the parent and farther to Charles Takudzwa Mubaiwa had agreed to yr guidance you gave us yesterday that you  we are waiting for response from other Universities like LPU and that's our position only that we had not had time to discuss with Charles our position as parents.
12/3/24, 9:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Mubaiwa!
I hope you are doing well. May I please ask you to help me understand the above message?
12/3/24, 9:08 AM - Transnational auto: Our position is to go by your above guidance to make a choice.
This is on condition that the other Universities will reply in time to start the Visa applications in time  according to yr knowledge and hope we may get something cheaper especially on boarding because we wanted him to be on campus accomodation. But this not work in our favor we will take up Galgotias offer and move on.
12/3/24, 9:34 AM - Transnational auto: Hie. Mr Dev Kumar.
The final position is that Ms Ashi just called me and we had a very long conversation. Now am  in picture.

So therefore our new position as parents to Charles is.

1.We've taken Galgotias offer and let's proceed with AAL processing.

2. We will take up the off-campus accomodation  at Galgotias. 
3. We shall pay up the balance of   USD 1050  tuition as per yr guidance.

4. So we are good and ready to go. Let's proceed.
12/3/24, 9:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Mr. Mubaiwa for sharing your summary of the call with Ms. Ashi, it appears that all of your queries were cleared on the call. Moving forward, as I said earlier, your application for AAL is already in process, as soon as we get any update from the university, we will provide you with the update. Till then, I would recommend you to kindly have some patience, while we will provide you with the updates. <This message was edited>
