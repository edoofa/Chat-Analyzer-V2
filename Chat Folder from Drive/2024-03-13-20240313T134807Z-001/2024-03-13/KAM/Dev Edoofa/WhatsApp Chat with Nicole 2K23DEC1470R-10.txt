For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes we can start
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - +263 78 180 6975: I am done
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Cleared
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Following
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 2:36 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Cleared
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes let us begin

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 180 6975: 2.There is a strong relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development.Entreprenuership is an important driver of economic growth as it creates new businesses and employment and new products and services to the community.Entrepreneurs take risks and invent new businesses and this helps with a better change of our economy .As economies develop they create more opportunities for entrepreneurs,for example  as countries develop they often experience an increase in startup activities

3/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 180 6975: 4. What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory.Accounting standards are a set of principles and rules that govern the preparation of of financial statements.The most used accounting standards are the GAAP .It is mandatory to have them because it ensures that financial are prepared in a transparent way and it helps to protect investors that the information they receive is trustworthy .It promotes economic efficiency by reducing the cost of capital and encouraging investment.

3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you were scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2nd January).

5/1/24, 1:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: Shall we start with our session?
5/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes please
5/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes we are getting prepared to pay
5/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Thank you for the reminder
5/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
5/1/24, 2:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes this is accurate
6/1/24, 8:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nicole and Parents!
I hope all of you are doing great.

There was technical Glitch due to which, we were not able to take forward our conversation. Shall we start with our session now?
6/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes we can
6/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
6/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 679 2559: Yes we are .
6/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics
6/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 679 2559: We all wish to have that
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 77 679 2559: Yes please
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 679 2559: Tomorrow at 2
6/1/24, 12:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: Since, tomorrow is a Sunday, We will not be able to connect for the further session.
We will connect on Monday.
6/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 679 2559: Ok thank you
8/1/24, 9:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nicole!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 12:00pm so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 12:00 pm. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
9/1/24, 11:54 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful day ahead. We are excited to take forward the admission process and I trust that you are excited as well. Before starting our session, please let me know how are you all doing today?
9/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 180 6975: I am doing great and you
10/1/24, 9:56 AM - +263 77 514 1417: Good morning Edofa team hope you are all well. It's been long since we had sessions!
15/1/24, 10:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!

16/1/24, 11:08 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!

17/1/24, 7:25 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Ok thank you
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nicole and Parents!

17/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 78 180 6975: I am doing great and you
17/1/24, 4:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing absolutely fine as well. Thanks for asking.
17/1/24, 4:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: In our last conversation, we discussed the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
17/1/24, 11:13 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes please can  you  explain
18/1/24, 10:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Nicole and Parents!

I hope you are doing well. We have our session right now. May I know if you are ready to take forward our session?
19/1/24, 8:17 PM - +263 77 514 1417: Good day Dev Kumar, Nicole has was facing a few challenges one that concerned time but I'm glad you resolved, then her mobile phone just went dead yesterday but I'm glad I managed to get a new one . So please just bare with us for the inconveniences we have caused during that period.
20/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Good morning sir .Sorry for late replys ,my phone was dead and now everthing is ok and we can now  have our lessons
20/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. Tokora,
I hope you are doing well. No worries, @263781806975 @263775141417! I completely understand your concern. Such kinds of situations are faced by almost all of us and we can do nothing about it. Life Happens!
20/1/24, 10:56 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes sir thank you for understanding
20/1/24, 10:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: No worries, @toxyn! May I know if you are available for our session right now?
20/1/24, 11:44 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes lm available
20/1/24, 11:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! In our last session, we were discussing about the benefits of the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan. Now that you have gone through the benefits of the same, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/1/24, 11:56 AM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes please
20/1/24, 11:57 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
20/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 180 6975: I agree
20/1/24, 12:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
20/1/24, 12:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
20/1/24, 12:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
20/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes l can see that and there is enough time to earn money
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
20/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes
20/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
20/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes you can explain
20/1/24, 1:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you know that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you plan to pay by today, your due date of 20 January 2024.
20/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
20/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes
20/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Ok l will inform my father
20/1/24, 1:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, @263781806975! Make sure that you are completing the payment by today itself. Please take a note of it.
20/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Ok
20/1/24, 1:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now moving forward, may I know if you are thinking the same?
20/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes l do
20/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
20/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
20/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 1:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
20/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes this is a good idea because parents will not have a burden of paying huge sums of money in a small period of time
20/1/24, 1:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
20/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes it is
20/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 514 1417: Good afternoon sir, I'm asking for an extension of this deadline to Monday because I was working in an area were network is a challenge so I'm actually suddened by this deadline. Please I will pay by end of day on Monday 22nd.
20/1/24, 2:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand your concern @263775141417. I will share and discuss this concern with the Academic Board. Till that time I would like you to mail this concern to the Academic Board by Email. 

Email Id- academicboard@edoofa.com

State your concern in this email and send it as soon as possible.
20/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 514 1417: Noted thank you
20/1/24, 2:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. Shall we move ahead @263781806975 ?
20/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Yes please
20/1/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Now, in the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
20/1/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months
20/1/24, 2:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
20/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 180 6975: Sounds good we can proceed
22/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
22/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 77 514 1417: Noted and understood. Thank you for the wonderful simplified financial plan.
22/1/24, 10:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most can discuss this with their family on the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family?
22/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 514 1417: As of now we are at different locations so I have no doubt what I conclude is good for us. So I think the plan is workable all we need to do is be punctual and time consious and fulfil the obligation.
22/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 77 514 1417: By the way I have send that e mail and I haven't received an answer concerning the late payment which I'm sure will do tomorrow.

Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it?

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
24/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
24/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort.
