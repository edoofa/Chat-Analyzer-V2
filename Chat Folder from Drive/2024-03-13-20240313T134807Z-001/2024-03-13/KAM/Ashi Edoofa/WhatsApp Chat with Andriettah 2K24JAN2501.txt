Unlike other countries Edoofa is affordable. Moreover Edoofa offers students with EWYL programs which helps students to reduce their annual fees as much as they can .The students are given online real time live projects .

8/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

8/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/2/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

8/2/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please
8/2/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 614 6798: From the videos l have learnt that students should be teachable, open minded and be able to follow instructions, and that the student should understand that Edoofa has invested alot of time in identifying good suitable schools ,colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians .Moreover founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions not forgetting that the Edoofian vision that is not to just get affordable and quality education and promoting employment through the SEELS program ,but it is also focused on increasing students capacity for success,thus making students more responsible and independent and lastly the statement of purpose  is an important document that students should be prompt in taking action, and be diligent in filling out the form.
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/2/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

8/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 614 6798: We are on the same page
8/2/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.

9/2/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 614 6798: 2. An entrepreneur is someone who takes financial risks of starting and managing a new business venture. 
Entrepreneurship promotes economic growth in the sense that it provides access to goods and services leading to economic development . Ultimately entrepreneurs will introduce innovative technologies, products and services. Thus itself will lead to economic development. In the sense that entrepreneurship also leads to a decrease in unemployment thus leading to an increase in living standards. 

3. GAAP are generally accepted accounting principles which involves a set of accounting rules , standards and procedures issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Board.According to the objectivity principle, GAAP-compliant financial statements provided by your accountant must be based on objective evidence.

In the sense that they enable the users of accounts to be able to make judgements and comparisons on the results of business. They are mandatory because they help improve and harmonize financial reporting around the world and reduce confusing variations in the methods used to prepare accounts.

5. Accounting is the process of recording financial transactions pertaining to a business. This includes summarizing and analyzing and reporting a company’s financial transactions. Whereas Auditing is in line with checking the accuracy and authenticity of the books of Accounts and the financial statements of the company. This happens by given either an unqualified opinion or a qualified opinion .
9/2/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
9/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Okay ma’am

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

9/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
9/2/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
9/2/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted with thanks ma’am
9/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263716146798 With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
9/2/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 01st March, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
9/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Thank you for the reminder ma’am 
Yes we have been able to
9/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear, We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
9/2/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
9/2/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 614 6798: It is accurate
9/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
9/2/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
9/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
9/2/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
9/2/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am it’s not possible
9/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
9/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/2/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/2/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes he has
9/2/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
9/2/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
9/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
9/2/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
9/2/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 614 6798: I have ma’am
9/2/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
9/2/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
9/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted ma’am
9/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/2/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/2/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/2/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted ma’am
9/2/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/2/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes please ma’am, also you mentioned about the visa fee and flight expenses may we please get a round figure so we budget accordingly
9/2/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263716146798. The Visa fees would be around $83 and the cost of flight tickets depends on the demand although it might costd between $450 - $500
9/2/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Okay thank you ma’am 🙏
9/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome dear,  Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
9/2/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/2/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
9/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 614 6798: This is great!
9/2/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/2/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
9/2/24, 2:43 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes l am excited!
9/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
9/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
9/2/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
9/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Am not aware of the solution ma’am
9/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
9/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/2/24, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/2/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 614 6798: That’s great !  No ma’am l have understood
9/2/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 614 6798: No ma’am
9/2/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/2/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am l am
9/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
9/2/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

11/3/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
11/3/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 614 6798: 1. $900
2. ⁠$1000
3. ⁠$1000
11/3/24, 1:11 PM - +27 61 763 2582: Greetings
11/3/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $900.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses by Edoofa, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes it is
11/3/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
11/3/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1000. However, You have an advantage here as your cost of accommodation will be $0.
11/3/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Noted
11/3/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
11/3/24, 4:05 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
11/3/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
11/3/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of your university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
11/3/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
11/3/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1800 and accommodation fee at campus is $0, making your total annual education cost $1800, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/3/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
11/3/24, 4:27 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
11/3/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $1800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1800- $1000 = $800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
11/3/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
11/3/24, 4:42 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes it does
11/3/24, 4:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
11/3/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $1000 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $1800 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrives in India will be $1800- $1000 = $800. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $400 and $400 , with a six-month gap between them.
11/3/24, 8:04 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Ma’am l have a question 
Does the registration fee of $1000 include University exam fee: $40-$60 per annum, ERP fee: $10 per annum, Uniform fee: $43 (one time), Laundry Charges $60, AC Room Charges $40-$60
11/3/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I have been looking forward for your response to move ahead with your admission journey, As my operational hours are over for today. We will connect tomorrow at 02:00 pm, I hope you will be available for the discussion.
11/3/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!

12/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
12/3/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, I would like to first address your query here that the registration fees does not include the above mentioned fees as the registration fees will be adjusted in your first-year tuition fees which is $1800. The remaining amount of $800 for the first year tuition fees can be paid in installments.  The first installment can be paid either before you arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
12/3/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
12/3/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 24th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
12/3/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
12/3/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
12/3/24, 3:45 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Please do ma’am
12/3/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, According to the payment plan, you can pay the amount of $1000 for your registration fees in installment, This $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 24th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $500 before the second deadline date of *April 24th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
12/3/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 24th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
12/3/24, 3:53 PM - +263 71 614 6798: Yes ma’am
12/3/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
12/3/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
12/3/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 614 6798: In Bulawayo
12/3/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
12/3/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

12/3/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.
