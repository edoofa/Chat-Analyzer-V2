If there is no further progress to this scholarship due to reasons being that we paid late may please kindly refund our fee so that we may look for other options since the Earn While You Learn program which was promised to be done when I got back is no longer being done, therefore it seems that the scholarship is not going anywhere. Thank you.
12/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanastwa, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I understand that you must be concerned before we move forward with our discussion. I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.
