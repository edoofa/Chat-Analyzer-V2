You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
5/3/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk thank you
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, I am sure that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

7/3/24, 8:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
7/3/24, 8:47 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Morning ma'am yes we can
7/3/24, 8:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
7/3/24, 8:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
7/3/24, 8:56 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Morning ma'am owk l am not sure of how long the process will take but will try to be as quick as l can in delivering the letter
7/3/24, 8:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/3/24, 8:58 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk yes we can
7/3/24, 8:59 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/3/24, 9:00 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am
7/3/24, 9:03 AM - +263 78 515 6440: I'm done going through the image ma'am
7/3/24, 9:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
7/3/24, 9:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/3/24, 9:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
7/3/24, 9:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
7/3/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Nevermind it's clear now
7/3/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
7/3/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
7/3/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
7/3/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
7/3/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes l'm following
7/3/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
7/3/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/3/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
7/3/24, 9:47 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
7/3/24, 11:44 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am once we have paid 500-1000 is it reduced from the 1800 we're also supposed to pay
7/3/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
7/3/24, 8:51 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am thank you
8/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 77 236 1548: <Media omitted>

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you for the past couple of days.

I am pleased to connect with you today to move ahead with your admission journey, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
11/3/24, 10:20 AM - +263 77 236 2009: Good morning Ashi
11/3/24, 10:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for connecting with me today, I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
11/3/24, 12:03 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Good morning miss Ashi from the videos  l understood that one shud have a feeling of independence,be open minded and be able to go an extra mile .l understood that we're not encouraged to use a lot of feelings puting blame on circumstances but to grab every opportunity we can.We were also encouraged to go to the source and ask for what we want in the right way .From the Steve Jobs story l got that in this current case the source and foundation is EDOOFA.l understood that EDOOFA can get me from my Country to India in less than 20 days.l also got that l can get affordable education through this scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL).l can also get to interact with a community of students while growing and solving problems together.l can also gain skills from the part time jobs l get from EDOOFA.From the example of a tank and a cup l got that EDOOFA can change one's capacity to a lot of success from a capacity of a cup to a capacity of a tank metaphorically.l got that the Students of EDOOFA Earning and Learning to Success program a student can become independent and responsible. EDOOFA also appreciates students that are coachable , follow instructions, open minded, able to identify opportunities better than others, having a positive attitude and not acting like they are entitled. EDOOFA considers the following points when choosing a University:
•Whether the students are happy,the quality of education that is how qualified the faculty and teaching staff are 
•Whether the Universities and Schools are acredited by proper bodies e.g (UGC) the Universities Grants of Commission of India,(ECT) Counsel of Technical Education in India and (NAC) these are also the acredations they worked with to get in touch with the best schools in India that meet certain criterias •Whether the buildings are well built with proper infrastructure and accomodation.
•If the University is well approved to take international students 
•What the owners of the University's main aim is whether since some universities focus on making students work but with EDOOFA u work while u go to school
Students should also get exposed to the Indian Cultures e.g HOLY which is a festive of lights .A student is also expected to have the right skills, attitude and knowledge which are called the EDOOFA triangle .One can be helped to know more about the profession they would have studied through the EWYL program and one's attitude can be improved through counselling sessions and these sessions c also help one know the requirements of employers and the right landscape .Students are also involved in the students community to be well trained when maybe in the future they want to build their own work team and be involved in community engagement.Thank you that's all l understood from the videos

11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos, I am truly amazed to see that you had a good understanding of the videos. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 236 1548: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 1:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above document with us dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes l was ma'am but l just have one question how do l get access to the Universities under EDOOFA and the best one for my course ?
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Ok ma'am
11/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query dear, I would like to share that when we will submit your application to multiple universities for consideration. The dedicated admission teams at these institutions will now be reviewing your application for the prestigious scholarship opportunity you are aiming for.

Once we receive the offer letter, I will promptly share it with you. We can then delve into discussing the universities that align best with your aspirations for higher education.  I hope that's clear ?
11/3/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Ooh ok yes that's very clear
11/3/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
11/3/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

12/3/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 515 6440: 1.Give a brief introduction, highlighting your skills with an example.
12/3/24, 10:46 AM - +263 78 515 6440: <Media omitted>
12/3/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 515 6440: 2.What is your understanding of UI/UX and it's usage in today's digital world ?

UI stands for User Interface,it is were humans interact with computers .Anything one interacts with as a user of computers is part of the user interface e.g screens,sound,overall style .In today's digital world UI processes the development, creation of menus and tools that allow users to navigate a digital product including websites,mobile apps,TVs,coffee makers, microwaves,cookers,stoves,radios.

UX stands for User Experience which is a critical component of any digital product.By investing in a good UX design businesses can improve user satisfaction,save money and time,improve accessibility,stay competitive and promote innovation creativity.It is the one that designs the UImaking sure it's intritive and user friendly.It determines how well navigate ,find what they need and accomplish their goals
12/3/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 515 6440: 3.What is your understanding of the OSI model?Please explain it with the layers involved.

The OSI system is the Open System Intercinnection model ,it is a framework used to describe the functions of a networking into seven layers which are:
•Physical Later which transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium
•Data link layer which defines the format of data in the network
•Network Layer which decides which physical path the data will take
•Transport Layer which transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UCP
•Session Layer which maintains connections and is responsible for controlling parts and sessions.
•Presentation Layer which ensures that data is in a usable format and is were data encryption ocurs.
•Application Layer which is the human computer interaction layer,where applications can access the network services.
12/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 515 6440: 4.What do you understand by Programming and Programming Languages ?Which languages are most widely used in today's applications and why?

•Programming is a process of telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems that is humans create instructions for a computer to follow in a language computers can understand.
•A programming language is a way for programmes (developer's)to communicate with computers . Programming Languages consist of a set of rules that allow string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code ,or in the case of visual programming languages ,graphical elements.
•The most commonly used programming languages in today's applications are Python,followed by Java, JavaScript and C++
•Python is a very easy language to use and learning Python is easy too.Indeed Python code can be written rather easily and executed much faster than other coding languages ,thus making it the ideal choice for coding beginners and newcomers.
•Java has flexible and sociable ,built in security features and it's compatible with numerous other technologies,it is often used for creating dynamic web applications especially on the server side.
•JavaScript enables dynamic content on websites,enhances user interactivity,and facilitates a synchronous communication with server.As a client-side scripting language.It runs in web browsers, allowing developers to create interactive and responsive user interface.
•C++ is a fast and efficient language .It is also essential for game development and complex business applications.
12/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 515 6440: 5. What is the difference between Compilers and Interpreters?
•Complilers translate code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code  before the program runs.Interpreters translates code written in high-level programming language into machine code line by line.
•Convert language to machine code so that the process than execute it.Follows one step to get from source code to execution the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language.
•A compiler displays error and warning while compiling.So ,you can't run is program unless you fix the errors.An interpreter reads every statement, then displays the errors if any.A user must resolve these errors in order to interpret the next line.
•They are very difficult to implement because they can't predict anything that happens during the turn time.The interpreted language supports Dynamic Typing.
12/3/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzaiishe, Wishing you a wonderful day!
12/3/24, 10:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing your response regarding the SOP form and academic interview questions. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
12/3/24, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/3/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Morning ma'am yes it is very correct
12/3/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/3/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/3/24, 10:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/3/24, 10:57 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/3/24, 10:58 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes ma'am l agree
12/3/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/3/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/3/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes ma'am that's correct
12/3/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Ma'am l have a question how will l receive this letter will it be through email or watsapp ?
12/3/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You will receive the offer letter from the university in your mail inbox and we will also share the offer letter with you here in the group.
12/3/24, 11:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/3/24, 11:24 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am
12/3/24, 11:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
12/3/24, 11:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/3/24, 11:25 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes ma'am we are
12/3/24, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
12/3/24, 11:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/3/24, 11:43 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Yes ma'am I have
12/3/24, 11:47 AM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am is the $650 the one we can clear with the EWYL program ?
12/3/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, you can pay the amount of $650 with the help of the credits you will earn in your EWYL program. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/3/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/3/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Owk ma'am so let's say l am done paying my fees for that year d l continue with the program or l'll be done for that year
12/3/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263785156440 I didn't understand your query here, could you please let me know what is your query ?
12/3/24, 9:48 PM - +263 78 515 6440: Ok ma'am l meant after l have cleared my fees for that year do l continue with the EWYL program that year?
