I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the holiday season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 325 2317: Okay

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.

29/2/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 589 5789: I have always wanted to be a physiotherapist....having that eagerness of how you can make someone feel better after being in a terrible condition.... actually my passion for being a physiotherapist was driven to higher grounds when my grandfather needed it, but didn't get it in time since the sessions were expensive also there were just a few options of physiotherapistd to choose from
29/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 71 589 5789: So I just thought being one of those physiotherapists, adding to their number would help the world at large....would make those in need of the physiotherapy get it....because it was soo painful losing a loved one because of something that could have been corrected
