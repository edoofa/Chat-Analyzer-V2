11/3/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/3/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

11/3/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/3/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
11/3/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

11/3/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/3/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
12/3/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 117 3528: To sum up the 4 videos ,I have understood that the co -founders of Edoofa have set up these four videos for us Edoofians to answer those dying questions or the curiosities we were having .For instance which University are we going to be enrolled to , accommodation,The Earn While You Learn Program together with accreditations we get if we work twice as hard .They also emphasized about the way the Edoofa Scholarship Program goes about in the sense it focuses on both quality affordable education and a hands on approach on the courses that we will be doing .Which is an essential skill on the 24th century.Us Edoofians we need both equally theoretical knowledge and also practical knowledge which will help us in the next 5 to 10 years .To add on they talked about Holi a festive of colours that takes place in India which unites people .It also enable Edoofians to work as a collective rather than working alone .Also  international students are given a privilege to be apart of something that’s beautiful and also other Edoofians will be telling or explaining to other new Edoofians about how the Holi festival goes about .I loved that part about the Holi festival .I love culture and I understand the importance of culture as my guardians they always tell me to respect cultural festives and even if its not my culture I should respect it .If I can be honest I can not wait to also be a part of the Holi festivals.Circling back to what I understood from the co-founders they also mentioned that they have allocated mentors throughout the whole scholarship process and I have seen it so far starting from my counselor Mr Keshav ,Mrs Guneet and now you my administration officer and Iam pleased about that and I admire that a lot . <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me, I am glad to see your understanding here. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
12/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
12/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 117 3528: Yess I agree with everything and I have a better understanding of the 4videos
12/3/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 117 3528: Yes we are on the same page
12/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 117 3528: Yes we can move forward
12/3/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
12/3/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
