24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
24/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
24/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 837 6846: I understand
24/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 837 6846: So I should start preparing the SOP now?
24/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788376846 Dear, I will help you in preparing the SOP, Kindly don't worry
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay ma'am
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes it's very clear
24/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/1/24, 4:07 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
24/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/1/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
24/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Absolutely
24/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay for now my network if poor, so if I manage to download them I will let you know ma'am.
24/1/24, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Once you have gone through the videos please do let me know.
24/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay ma'am
24/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 78 837 6846: I watched the vedios and I have to come to Understand as an Edoofian to earn maximum scholarships one have to put a maximum effort by following instructions, and also having best qualities. Also the EDOOFA programme has a paved a path for us to fulfil our careers, in the sense that they produce graduates with skills and knowledge on how to deliver what they have been studying. It also offer good resources to research and have practical skills. They also work in hand with best universities so the EDOOFA program helps students to get a place to study at top universities and colleges where there are a plenty of resources and all educational necessities. Also through doing tasks in the EWYL program one can earn maximum credits to make the educational expenses more affordable for the students. The SOP together with the qualifications help to convince the university about why one is eligible for that scholarship, expressing your personal traits, your skills and why you want to study a certain program that you have applied for.
24/1/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that the insights you have shared with us, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/1/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/1/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/1/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/1/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
24/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes Ma'am
24/1/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
24/1/24, 7:01 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

25/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
25/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay ma'am
25/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (30-Jan-2024).
25/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/FscxQsGrXiuGnUr0dvmJPY
25/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Eutria Mapfumo, and my EWYL group name is Eutria EWYL23E1217. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (30-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
25/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
25/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay noted
25/1/24, 12:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
25/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 21st February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
25/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay
25/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay, I will ask my father about that
25/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Physiotherapy* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes that is correct ma'am
25/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes, So you will be helping me to choose the best one.
25/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
25/1/24, 12:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes ma'am
25/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
25/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes it's quite clear
25/1/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
25/1/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay
25/1/24, 1:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay
25/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay for the admission process, I have to pay an amount of $500 to $1000 and for my education, the fees will be ranging from $1200 to $1800 depending on the university
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263788376846
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
25/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 837 6846: This is actually great.
25/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263788376846 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
25/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes ma'am
25/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
25/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 837 6846: No, can you share the solution with me.
25/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I understand, that will work better.
25/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 837 6846: I don't have any queries for now, but it's quite unfortunate that my father is not reachable for moment maybe he have some questions.
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 837 6846: For the admission process it's $500 to $1000 and for higher education it's $1200 to $1800
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem my dear, I am always here for you and your family. If he has any query, I will more than happy to assist him.
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I will try to contact him.
25/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

29/2/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 837 6846: On the 19th of February I went to the meet and greet Session and it was a great moment where I have come to know more about Edoofa program. During the session I have learnt a lot about the program and this program aims to provide quality education to all students irregardless of their backgrounds. We watched the vedios, and I saw the best life one will live in India as an Edoofian. As an Edoofian, one will get the opportunity to meet some of the people  who are running big companies and be able to get skills in running business and also learn to be a best employee as well as an employer after completing your studies. I was very thrilled and from that day I'm now eager to go to India for best and quality education and also I will get a chance to interact with people from different cultures and some of Indian festivals. I attended the summit with my Uncle and from the session he was also assured that this program aims to provide light to Africa students
29/2/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear about your positive experience at the meet and greet session where you learned more about the Edoofa program. It's great that you are excited about the opportunity to pursue quality education in India through this program. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 837 6846: No
29/2/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes, I wasn't able to meet the team personally because of time, my Uncle was in a hurry, I  finished writing the exam but he told me that he is behind time, he was supposed to have a long journey that same day so it wasn't safe for me to be left behind that why I left jus after the session
29/2/24, 11:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. I would like to share some pictures with you of the event so that you can share it with your family and friends. I am sure you must be excited to see them as well, right ?

1/3/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, May I know if you have gone through the offer letter ?

1/3/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
1/3/24, 12:55 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Thank  you
1/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
1/3/24, 1:10 PM - +27 71 995 6221: I got it i was asking  just  to clear about the payments thank you
1/3/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27719956221 Please don't worry, I will be assisting with the payment plan in our discussion, In the meantime please share your response for the above questions please
1/3/24, 1:19 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Ok thank you
1/3/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Please share your response
1/3/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 837 6846: 1)$350
2)$0
3)$1600
4)$125
5)$1000
1/3/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
1/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes this is so great
1/3/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
1/3/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
1/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay noted
1/3/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
1/3/24, 3:13 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay the list is quite clear,
1/3/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
1/3/24, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
1/3/24, 4:12 PM - +27 71 995 6221: 100% clear
1/3/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
1/3/24, 4:18 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Its quiet clear
1/3/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
1/3/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
1/3/24, 4:26 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Clear
1/3/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as March 14th, 2024*.
1/3/24, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
1/3/24, 4:29 PM - +27 71 995 6221: So is it possible  for me to pay it via mama money  again
1/3/24, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I will share the payment method with you in a while, For now should I share the payment plan with you ?
1/3/24, 4:33 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Wil let you know  very soon
1/3/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I would like to share the payment plan with you please, The $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 14th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $500  before the second deadline date of *April 14th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
1/3/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 14th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
1/3/24, 4:40 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Yes can go to 1 and 2 500 this month and finish up my balance  Before  the 14th of April
1/3/24, 4:44 PM - +27 71 995 6221: This message was deleted
1/3/24, 4:45 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Its affordable
1/3/24, 4:47 PM - +27 71 995 6221: 1 and 2
1/3/24, 4:48 PM - +27 71 995 6221: hw much  is 500 dollars IN  randS
1/3/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, You can go ahead with the payment plan
1/3/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It would be around 9610 rands
1/3/24, 4:50 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Ok cool will l make  it  before  the date
1/3/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
1/3/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
1/3/24, 4:53 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Clear
1/3/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
1/3/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC
Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004
Swift Code: FBCPZWHA
Sort Code: 8127
1/3/24, 4:56 PM - +27 71 995 6221: Thank u my daughter is in Harare  i think  i wil send the money  to her and make  the  payments
1/3/24, 5:26 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Admission officer can you please send my results for the ESAT
2/3/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Eutria, I hope you are doing well!
2/3/24, 11:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, your results will be shared soon.
2/3/24, 11:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As we were discussion the payment modes with you, Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
2/3/24, 11:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
2/3/24, 11:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
2/3/24, 11:06 AM - +27 71 995 6221: Good morning
2/3/24, 11:07 AM - +27 71 995 6221: Noted

To provide further assurance, I will reshare the same. In the attached video, you will see Mr. Mukund from our team, dedicated to student welfare. The Department of Student Welfare ensures that all students are well-settled at the university, working to enhance their skills. They engage with students individually, address any challenges they may face, and guide them in building strong communities.

11/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
11/3/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 837 6846: How are you Admission officer? If I may ask, how do you rank universities in India because we have been arguing with my relatives after researching and we have come to see that MVN in the top 800.I don't know if we get the  correct information,
11/3/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am doing well thank you for asking, Before I assistt you with your query I would like to know what information have you received from your relatives about the MVN University, Could you please let me know ?
11/3/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I have come across an newspaper article which have list of some Universities which were said to be no longer accredited in Zimbabwe, So I just decided to make some researches on MVN. Country rank and also world rank
11/3/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, May I know what have gathered from your research please ?
11/3/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 837 6846: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 837 6846: <Media omitted>
11/3/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 837 6846: These are the researches I made
11/3/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching MVN. 

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourelf is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
11/3/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you must be aware that in May 2024, Edoofa would be completing 15 years, these years we have associated with 250+ universities where the degrees are recognized all over the world. Moreover, We have recommended your application at MVN University because the education quality is exceptional as only the student who have performed well in their academic gets the admission there. We believe that starting your higher education journey in such a fruitful environment will set you on the path to success.
11/3/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 837 6846: So can I have the reliable sources to really see the quality of the education provided. Of course India is known to have best universities with highly recognised degrees. But if we come across such rankings of certain universities will be demotivated because we are really expecting something much better from our universities in Zimbabwe. Of course we maybe be treated well in these institutions but we have to put the recognition of that institute before going any further. Like you said that EDOOFA is aimed to offer education from highly recognised institutions, how do we consider a University of such ranking? I need your help, we are here to make bold decisions together.
11/3/24, 3:40 PM - +263 78 837 6846: I'm not yet convinced with this University
11/3/24, 8:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, Please don't worry we will be assisting your doubts tomorrow as my operational hours are over for today. We will connect tomorrow at 2:00 Pm, I hope you will be tomorrow for the discussion. Kindly be assured I am all here to assist you ahead. Have a good night ahead!
11/3/24, 8:32 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay thank you
12/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eutria, Wishing you a good day! <This message was edited>
12/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our yesterday's discussion, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion ?
12/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 837 6846: How are you?
12/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Yes
12/3/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 837 6846: I'm ready
12/3/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking.
12/3/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the concern you shared with me yesterday, I would like to guide you here. While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
12/3/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's worth noting that we have been working in the education sector for over 14 years, ensuring that all the universities we are associated with maintain a high standard of education for our students. The message you shared seems to question the quality of education and directly counters the recommendation made by the academic board. With that in mind, I would like to understand your perspective more comprehensively to address this matter effectively. Could you please share your thoughts here?
12/3/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay. I was thinking that it is good if we apply for another university. When I started the application process I was told that one can apply to different universities. Maybe I have got only one choice.
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
12/3/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
12/3/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 837 6846: Okay I think we have to wait for other universities, as for this one I have just shared my honest insight.
12/3/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?

12/3/24, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
12/3/24, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
