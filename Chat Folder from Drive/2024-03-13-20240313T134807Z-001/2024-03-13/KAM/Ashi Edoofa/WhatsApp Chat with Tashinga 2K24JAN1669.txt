For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
7/2/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we can
7/2/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 013 3757: I have gone through it
7/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
7/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
7/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
7/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
7/2/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 013 3757: They are, thank you
7/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
7/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
7/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
7/2/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
7/2/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yeah,,,we can continue
7/2/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
7/2/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
7/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
7/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
7/2/24, 1:22 PM - +263 78 013 3757: This message was deleted
7/2/24, 1:24 PM - +263 78 013 3757: After the registration fee,,,,,,,, do I also pay the remaining tuition fee whilst I am still  here or I pay when I arrive in India
7/2/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The tuition fees can be paid before your arrival or after your arrivel dear
7/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Thank you
7/2/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 013 3757: All clear now
7/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we can start
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
7/2/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
7/2/24, 1:32 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes you can
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let me share the videos with you. I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
7/2/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 013 3757: I can go through them in the next 30 minutes
7/2/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Please do let me know once you have gone through the videos
7/2/24, 3:03 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes I am almost done
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 013 3757: I am done
7/2/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
7/2/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok ,,,on these first videos they emphasized that edoofians should be be open minded with the ability to come up with new ideas and be innovative. They also highlighted the significance of adhering to instructions which is a crucial aspect in being an edoofian
7/2/24, 3:27 PM - +263 78 013 3757: On this video they explained the other hidden point that EWYL program is also meant to prepare the edoofians for the real society and to be self dependant. A scholarship is not all about having fully funding and getting affordable fess but also being mentored throughout the whole journey is also a vital role in which edoofa offers to all proud edoofians
7/2/24, 3:41 PM - +263 78 013 3757: On this one,,,,the emphasized how the SOO is supposed to be written and it's importance of getting a university place. The edoofa recommendation also plays a critical role in the university application. They write a recommendation based on my participation in application and they also make sure that I get accepted
7/2/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to add?
7/2/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok, I They also assured their capability of helping me choose a good university due to their experience with the best universities and colleges
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Tashinga, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
7/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
7/2/24, 3:53 PM - +263 78 013 3757: All clear now,,,,,,,thank you very much
7/2/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
7/2/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Dry mount is when a specimen is placed on a slide with or without a cover slip on it and is often used on dry specimens like hair and pollen. Wet mount is when a specimen is placed on a slide with a coverslip placed over it and is often used for viewing samples
8/2/24, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, Have you submitted this form as well ?
8/2/24, 4:24 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Can I submit this one a bit later I'm having internet problems

8/2/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

9/2/24, 12:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tashinga, I hope you find this message in good health and high spirit!
9/2/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our yesterday conversation, May I kindly know if you have completed the SOP form ?
9/2/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes I'm done still trying to submit
9/2/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, I am looking forward for your response regarding the form, May I know by when you will be able to submit the form ?
9/2/24, 6:02 PM - +263 78 013 3757: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 6:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above screenshot with us. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
9/2/24, 6:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22nd February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
9/2/24, 6:08 PM - +263 78 013 3757: This message was deleted
9/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
9/2/24, 6:09 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes
9/2/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma in Medical Lab. Technology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
9/2/24, 6:10 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Its accurate
9/2/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
9/2/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
9/2/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
9/2/24, 6:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
9/2/24, 6:15 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes
9/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
9/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/2/24, 6:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/2/24, 6:19 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes,he did
9/2/24, 6:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
9/2/24, 6:20 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we are
9/2/24, 6:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
9/2/24, 6:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
9/2/24, 6:23 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes
9/2/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
9/2/24, 6:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
9/2/24, 6:28 PM - +263 78 013 3757: I'm following
9/2/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
9/2/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
9/2/24, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
9/2/24, 6:30 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok, following
9/2/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Clearly understood
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/2/24, 6:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/2/24, 6:36 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Impressive
9/2/24, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/2/24, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
9/2/24, 6:44 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes
9/2/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
9/2/24, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
9/2/24, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
9/2/24, 6:48 PM - +263 78 013 3757: No
9/2/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
9/2/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/2/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/2/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Well understand
9/2/24, 8:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/2/24, 8:54 PM - +263 78 013 3757: No
9/2/24, 8:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/2/24, 8:56 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes I am
9/2/24, 8:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
9/2/24, 8:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
10/2/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 013 3757: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 13 February fro 8.30am to 9.30 am

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Ok , firstly I want to thank the edoofa team for hosting such a wonderful event. We were able to connect with the whole ediofa team who was there and was also able to speak with Mr Angad the founder in person . The session really impressed us and also inspired us and now I am  looking forward to be a successful edoofian.
28/2/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, I am glad to know that you were impressed with the session. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
28/2/24, 4:54 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes over 600 if I'm not mistaken
28/2/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780133757, There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
28/2/24, 6:10 PM - +263 78 013 3757: I just spoke with Mr Angad outside randomly and it was not a recorded session. This is because my parents were not available because they were busy with something and the team instructed that parents should come n meet for questions
28/2/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. I would like to share some pictures with you of the event so that you can share it with your family and friends. I am sure you must be excited to see them as well, right ?

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
12/3/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
12/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Thank you once again,,,, I am well ready for the discussion
12/3/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
12/3/24, 1:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
12/3/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes we can proceed
12/3/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
12/3/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
12/3/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 013 3757: 1) my seemester tuition fee is 975

2) The standard duration for the course is 3 years

3) admission processing fee is 200

4) registration fee is 700
12/3/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
12/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes it is
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
12/3/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
12/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Well understood
12/3/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
12/3/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
12/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Well clear
12/3/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
12/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes well clear
12/3/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  March 25th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
12/3/24, 3:48 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Is it not 30 days
12/3/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
12/3/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 013 3757: U mean this one?
12/3/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes you can explain
12/3/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, According to the payment plan, you can pay the amount of $700 for your registration fees in installment, This $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $375 before the first deadline date of *March 25th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $375 before the second deadline date of *April 25th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
12/3/24, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $700 within 15 working days, before March 25th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
12/3/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes it's clear now
12/3/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
12/3/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
12/3/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 013 3757: Yes I'm in harare
12/3/24, 5:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would love to start our discussion today however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
