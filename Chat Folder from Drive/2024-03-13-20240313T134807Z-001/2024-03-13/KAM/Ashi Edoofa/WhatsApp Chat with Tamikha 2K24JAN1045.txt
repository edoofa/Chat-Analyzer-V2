I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes,we may start
19/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 214 7249: You may explain!
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Very clear!
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay noted
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l am
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 214 7249: l am very clear
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes you may

19/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263712147249 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 214 7249: My network is a little bad so l will inform you once lm done
19/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263712147249, I will be looking forward for your response.
19/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
20/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 71 214 7249: Greetings!
My understanding on those four videos was that the students should be following instructions as given and also the students need to be teachable and should be open minded as they are being taught.Edoofa helps the students to focus and also increase their capacity for success.With the help of Edoofa,students become more responsible and more independent.As for the Founders,they encourage students to follow instructions of the institutions.The statement of purpose is an important document which students should be prompt in taking action and be able to fill the forms.
20/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tamikha, I hope you are doing well.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with us regarding the videos. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Thank you
This has been noted and understood!
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

22/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 2.From my understanding, UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) are two interdependent terms, UI generally deals with the interaction between users and computer systems, software and applications whilist UX deals more generally with a user's overall experience with a brand, product or service.UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app or other electronic devices whilist UX refers to the entire interaction you have with a product.User interface and User experience are intertwined elements coherently existing to define the usability and functionality of a digital product.Both UI and UX design are essential for creating successful websites or mobile applications that meets the needs of the user and provides a positive experience.UI and UX design play a pivotal role in ensuring a product offers solutions to a user's problems and, most importantly, provides an exciting and hassle-free experience. They also increase the usability and functionality of the software.It improves product quality,it literally makes digital products more useable and  it can also benefit customer satisfaction, long-term engagement, employee productivity, brand loyalty, time to market, conversion metrics and brand equity.
22/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 3.The Open Systems Interconnection model is a framework in network communication designed to simplify complex network interactions into a structured format. This architecture has seven layers. All the seven layers work together to create a robust and efficient network communication system.
Starting with layer 1 :The Physical Layer deals with the physical aspects of data transmission, including cable types, electrical signals and data rates.It involves hardware components like cables, switches and network interface cards, forming the foundation of network communication.

Layer 2:The Data Link Layer frames data into packets. It handles physical addressing through MAC addresses, ensuring that data is directed to the correct hardware.This layer is also involved in error detection and handling, improving overall data transmission reliability.

Layer 3:This is the Network Layer,this layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing data packets across different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.The Internet Protocol , fundamental for internet data exchange, operates at this layer.

Layer 4:The Transport Layer is crucial for segmenting data into smaller packets. It ensures end-to-end data integrity and delivery, managing flow control, error correction and sequencing.TCP is an example of the main protocols in this layer

Layer 5:The Session Layer coordinates communication between systems, managing dialogues and synchronizing data exchange.

Layer 6:The Presentation Layer acts as a translator, converting data formats from the application layer into a network-compatible format and vice versa. It ensures that data sent from one system is readable by another.

Layer 7:The Application Layer is the closest to the end user. It facilitates user interaction with networked systems, providing interfaces and protocols for web browsers, email clients and other applications.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 4.Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that instruct a computer how to perform a task.Programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions in a computer, application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform.There are three types of programming languages which are machine language, assembly language and high-level language.As far as web and software development goes Python,JavaScript,  are among the most popular programming languages in today's market.They are mostly used because they act as a means for humans to communicate instructions to computers and create software solutions.Programming languages to translate directions into binary code that devices can follow as apps, websites, and software programs.Also,programming languages to translate directions into binary code that devices can follow as apps, websites, and software programs.Also,VBA is a version of Visual Basic that can be used to program Microsoft Office apps, such as Excel and PowerPoint.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 5.The differnces between an interpreter and a compiler are that the interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language,without converting it into machine code whilist a compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.An interpreter translates one statement of the program at a time into machine code whilist the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster execution since no translation is needed during runtime and the  interpreter translates code line by line during execution, making it easier to detect errors but potentially slowing down the program.Memory requirement is more on the compilers whilist memory requirement is less on interpreters.
22/1/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for the academic questions, May I know if you have completed the SOP form as well ?

22/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue with our discussion ?
22/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 214 7249: lm not yet done with the ewyl group but we can continue
22/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
22/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fees. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
thank you for the reminder
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 214 7249: the fees is yet to be paid anytime this week
22/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, I have taken a note of the update. In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes, thats very correct
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
22/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l agree
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay, well understood
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes,correct!
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l did
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Good day
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Its clear
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay noted
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
noted
22/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: noted
22/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 214 7249: No queries
We may continue
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes we are, thank you very much!
22/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Pkay,This is nice
22/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
22/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
22/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes, l woukd like to hear the news
22/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
22/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
22/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 214 7249: For the registration? lm not sure
l only know about the EWYL.
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Oh l understand
22/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 214 7249: I have no queries
22/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
22/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes l am
22/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
22/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, @263712147249 . I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
29/2/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 214 7249: We did not make it to go to Harare.
1/3/24, 8:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263712147249, I hope you are doing well!
1/3/24, 8:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable Name. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

3/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
3/3/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 214 7249: We may continue
3/3/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well. <This message was edited>
3/3/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

3/3/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263712147249 Please go through the above message again, I have change the message please
3/3/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay

2.$0
3.$1600
4.Both are  $125
5.$1000
3/3/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
3/3/24, 2:27 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes, thats a fantastic opportunity!
3/3/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
3/3/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
3/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes, well clarified
3/3/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
3/3/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
3/3/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 214 7249: l have gone through this!
3/3/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
3/3/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
3/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Very Clear
3/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
3/3/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
3/3/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes it does
3/3/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
3/3/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
3/3/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 214 7249: You are very clear
3/3/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as March 16th, 2024*.
3/3/24, 4:36 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay, l get that
3/3/24, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
3/3/24, 4:42 PM - +263 71 214 7249: You may explain please
3/3/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the payment plan. The $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 16th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $500 before the second deadline date of *April 16th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
3/3/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 16th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
3/3/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay sure
3/3/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 214 7249: May l have a few contacts of students from MVN.
3/3/24, 4:46 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay, well noted
3/3/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I will share the contact detail of one of the student with you in the next session
3/3/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
3/3/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
3/3/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay thank you
3/3/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 214 7249: l stay in Zvishavane
3/3/24, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
3/3/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC

3/3/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay thank you
3/3/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
3/3/24, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

3/3/24, 5:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

3/3/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
3/3/24, 6:14 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Good day Ashi,

I hope to find you well. I want to thank Edoofa for the processes being done  so that my child gets the best education in India.I am also glad she was offered a 90% shcholarship.

I have a special request to make if possible,i would prefer my child to be at LUP one of the Universities in the top rank according to the reserch i have done and where most of her school collegues are .

I hope to get a favourable response.
3/3/24, 10:08 PM - +263 71 214 7249: LPU**
4/3/24, 8:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tamikha, I hope you are doing well!
4/3/24, 8:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have shared your response late in the night, I was not able to assist you as my operational hours were concluded. Although, I would like to assist your doubts today, May I kindly know what is your query please ?
4/3/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 261 0514: Good morning,please note that  its not a query but a request IF POSSIBLE.
4/3/24, 9:47 AM - +263 78 261 0514: I have also highlighted the reason on yesterday's  communication.
4/3/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
4/3/24, 12:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them.
4/3/24, 12:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
4/3/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Noted ,thank you so much.
4/3/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
4/3/24, 5:38 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Kindly advise ,is it possible for us to make payment to MVN whilst we await response from LPU ,if it is successful then we can get a refund
4/3/24, 5:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 5:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
4/3/24, 5:48 PM - +263 78 261 0514: I think ita clear now, i can proceed with the payment then .Thank yoy
4/3/24, 5:48 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Thank you**
