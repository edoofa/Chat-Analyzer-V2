16/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kuvimbanashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

3/3/24, 6:55 PM - +263 77 238 0731: Greetings. Can you kindly share with us the status of the Offer letter. When the Edoofa team came to Zimbabwe, we had the opportunity to interact with them at their N1 hotel residence and were told that we were to receive the LPU offer letter the following week. We will appreciate if you can enlighten us as to when we can expect the offer letter.
3/3/24, 6:57 PM - +263 77 238 0731: Thank you for the update

4/3/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 238 0731: Good morning. Thank you for your response. We are now worried if ever LPU is going to respond, we were told the application to LPU was done on 1 December 2023 and we are now in March 2024 without a response. When we paid a visit to the N1 hotel residence to meet the Edoofa team, including the Founder, we went there to share our concern regarding the offer letter and we were assured that it was going to come the following week.  Kindly check for us please, we are sure it is within your powers to make a follow up on our behalf so that we plan our finances in a way that will not choke us.
4/3/24, 9:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your worries here dear, please don't worry I am here to make a follow up with the officials.
12/3/24, 6:47 PM - +263 77 228 2821: Good evening, Head of Counsellings. I have a question. For example if one is no longer interested in proceeding/going through this, if they want to withdraw what are the chances of getting a refund.
12/3/24, 6:47 PM - +263 77 228 2821: I missed that part
