16/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
18/1/24, 8:11 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Okay sir Lordwell will share the results with you for now he is not around and the network problems in our area .The results are not pleasing and we are still in shock of what really took place .The results are as follows

22/1/24, 1:29 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lordwell. Thank you for reaching out to me and sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in two subjects. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
22/1/24, 1:30 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
22/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 238 3956: Ok Ma'am thank you
22/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 238 3956: He is willing to take the carrier path mam.
Here we all know what he is capable of but we really don't know what happened. We are hoping that he should go to the next stage!

Thank you for being there for him👏
22/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 71 238 3956: Indeed mam you are correct.
23/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 621 5516: that's true mam l would like to continue

29/2/24, 8:10 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell

This is Ms. Vilsha and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. Please, how are you and your family doing today?
29/2/24, 8:12 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Good morning mam how are you
29/2/24, 8:29 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am doing well Lordwell, thank you for asking. I was recently having a discussion with Mr. Jyotishman - Director of Admissions at Edoofa and he mentioned that you wish to complete your remaining admission formalities early so that you can clear your first year university fee and ensure that you are all set for your arrival in August 2024. Is my understanding correct here?
29/2/24, 8:31 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Yes mam that's true ,your understanding is correct.
29/2/24, 8:32 AM - +263 78 621 5516: you are welcome!
29/2/24, 8:35 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are on the same page Lordwell. If I may ask, may I know if you recall what were the next steps in the completion of your admission journey and what all you need to be prepared with?
29/2/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 621 5516: After paying my admission fee ,Mr Shivjeet said l have received some offer letter from LPU so he said he will let us know the next stages on the 20th of January so we were waiting .
29/2/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 621 5516: We were yet to be told the next steps
29/2/24, 8:48 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: That is partially correct, Lordwell. As you are aware, we were in Harare last week for a seminar exclusively tailored for students who have completed the first step of their admission journey. During the seminar, we discussed the process forward. Let me provide you with a recap of our discussions:
29/2/24, 8:49 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've been diligently working on your scholarship application to assist you in securing offer letters from various universities in India, providing you with multiple options to choose from all while cross checking your eligibility for the course offered based on your A Level Results. Currently, you have received an offer letter from Galgotias University, and by the 15th of March, you were to expect to receive the remaining offer letters as well.
29/2/24, 8:50 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you receive the offer letters, you will have the privilege of comparing them and selecting the university that aligns best with your educational goals. Should you decide to change your university choice, you can do so with the transfer option, and any registration fees you've already paid will be adjusted accordingly.
29/2/24, 8:51 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Following the university selection, the next step will be to commence your visa application process, which will take place in April 2024. Our Department of Student Welfare will be in touch with you to guide you through this process. In the meantime, as a student, it's essential to focus on your EWYL Program and ensure you stay connected with your mentor to upskill yourself. I hope you recall these updates from the seminar?
29/2/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 621 5516: okkay thank you mam
29/2/24, 8:54 AM - +263 78 621 5516: well understood mam 👏
29/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Yes mam l recall them👏
29/2/24, 9:02 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Lordwell. As you are aware, Mr. Jyotishman has been strongly advocating for your application, and thanks to his hard work, we've been able to expedite your application process.
29/2/24, 9:03 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: We ensured that your result evaluation was completed at the earliest, and your offer letters have been obtained. With the grace of God, both Galgotias University and Lovely Professional University have accepted your application for the Diploma in Civil Engineering course and have issued the offer letters as well. These letters are currently being reviewed by the admissions team, and once that process is completed, we will share the letters with you in your admission group. You can expect to receive the letters by the end of today.
29/2/24, 9:03 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Meanwhile, during the evaluation of your results, the team noted that you were only able to pass one subject in your A Levels, which contributed to the delay in result evaluation. Could you please provide insight into what happened? Were you facing any challenges that prevented you from achieving your expected results?
29/2/24, 9:09 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Okkay mam firstly ,l was not facing any challenges but there were some family issues and as for me they strongly contributed to the outcome . There were some situations which popped out towards my final examination,that's the main reason!
29/2/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Okkay thank you so much mam for yours and Mr Jyotishman's efforts , l really appreciate👏
29/2/24, 9:23 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I can understand Lordwell. Encountering challenges is an inherent part of life, but what truly matters is how we confront and overcome them. I am glad to see that you're aware of the difficulties you've faced and recognize the importance of adaptability in the face of future challenges.
29/2/24, 9:23 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: You have to remember, you're at the beginning of your career journey, and while your A Level results may pose a temporary setback, they do not hinder your long-term career aspirations of becoming a civil engineer. You have to stay focused on your goals and continue to strive for excellence despite any obstacles you may encounter along the way.
29/2/24, 9:23 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, once the offer letters for the Diploma in Civil Engineering program are vetted by the team, I will share them with you here in your admission group. This will allow you to compare the offers and finalize your university choice. After that, we will guide you through the admission acceptance process and assist you in clearing your first-semester fees as per your request. Rest assured, we're here to support you every step of the way.
29/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 621 5516: That's true mam ,l learned how to remain focused nomatter how the situation is!
29/2/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Thank you for this life building advice mam👏
29/2/24, 9:26 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Lordwell. Let us conclude our conversation for now. We will reconvene later in the evening once your offer letters are all sorted out. In the meantime, if you have any queries or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. I will be available to reconnect with you and provide assistance as needed. Take care, and speak to you soon.
29/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 621 5516: Okkay thank you mam ,indeed we will reconnect in the evening,for any queries l will absolutely get in touch with you👏
1/3/24, 9:41 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Lordwell,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Following our discussion yesterday, I wanted to provide you with an update regarding your offer letter from Lovely Professional University.

With the grace of God, your offer letter has been approved by the academic board and university officials. Please find the letter attached below for your reference. 

After you are done reviewing the offer letter, kindly let me know so that we can reconnect and assist you in understanding the same letter better. This would ensure that we are able to finalise the choice of university for your education in India. God Bless you!
1/3/24, 9:42 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 10:59 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Greetings can you please explain did it change from degree to diploma thank you
1/3/24, 11:02 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263712383956, that is absolutely correct. As I was discussing with Lordwell yesterday, the course has been changed to Diploma in Civil Engineering based on his performance in A Level results. May I ask if you were able to go through the discussion we had yesterday with him so as to ensure all of us are together?
1/3/24, 11:26 AM - +263 71 238 3956: yes l went through the discussion ,l just wanted to understand !
1/3/24, 11:27 AM - +263 71 238 3956: So after the diploma will he be able to do a degree under Edoofa and how many years will it take after that?
1/3/24, 11:29 AM - +263 71 238 3956: l wanted to get more understanding because during the interviews you did not highlight that it will deviate to a diploma incase the A level results are not that good!
1/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 238 3956: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 71 238 3956: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 11:32 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Even here in your letters were not informed that it will get to this,anyways thank you now we know!
1/3/24, 11:33 AM - +263 71 238 3956: So can you further explain the offer letter to us ,thank you!
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in responding, @263712383956. I was occupied with a meeting and couldn't check your messages earlier. I'm glad to hear that you were able to go through the previous messages and find the clarity you needed. However, to ensure we're on the same page, let me address the concern you had:
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: When Lordwell enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, he initially enrolled for the course Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering. Therefore, to pursue this program, he was expected to clear all A-level subjects. The offer letter he secured from Galgotias University was for the same course, with the condition that his A-level results were pending and would be confirmed later.
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Unfortunately, Lordwell didn't perform well in his A-level exams and only secured one A-level pass. As a result, he is not eligible to pursue his bachelor's degree, not only in India but anywhere in the world. Understanding his situation, Mr. Jyotishman personally advocated to process the application early for the Diploma in Civil Engineering course. This ensures that Lordwell's career goals are not affected, and he can pursue his bachelor's degree after completing his diploma.
1/3/24, 1:39 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Therefore, Lordwell will be starting his Diploma in Civil Engineering in August 2024. After completing his diploma, if he wishes to further his education for a bachelor's degree, the Edoofa team will be here to assist him in that endeavor. You can rest assured of our support.
2/3/24, 5:11 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Ok thank you Ma'am
2/3/24, 5:27 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Ok Ma'am I have read the offer letter but his surname is not correct it's Mtikani not Mikani can you please correct it
2/3/24, 5:38 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Since we have paid the enrollment and registration fee what are we now supposed to do and can you explain more on the fees I am not understanding and accommodation
6/3/24, 4:32 AM - +263 71 238 3956: Greetings
9/3/24, 3:20 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you for the past couple of days. As you are aware, it has been a really busy month, with over 2700 students & parents meeting with us in Harare, and since we only have 300 scholarship spots left for this year, I have been working hard to make sure everyone has a fair chance to get into the university.
9/3/24, 3:24 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: As the Head of Admissions, ensuring every student secures their promised scholarship spots is my top priority. With that in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have updated Lovely Professional University and Galgotias University about the status of your scholarship application.
9/3/24, 3:24 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, regarding the concerns you raised about the name discrepancy, I have made a note of it. It appears to be a clerical error, and we have already discussed it with the university this week to ensure it is corrected.

In the meantime, I would also like to help you understand about the way further - now that you have received another offer letter from Lovely Professional University, it's time for your family to decide which university you wish to attend. Any registration fees you have already paid will be adjusted accordingly, so you won't have to pay any additional money if you decide to change your college.
9/3/24, 3:26 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: To ensure you fully understand the offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I have arranged for Ms. Ashi from our team to connect with you. She will reach out to you this afternoon to discuss the fee breakdown and timelines in detail. Ms. Ashi will assist you in making an informed decision regarding your higher education options.

If you have any questions or concerns at any point, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Wishing you all the best, and may God bless you on this journey!
9/3/24, 8:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lordwell, I hope you are doing well!
