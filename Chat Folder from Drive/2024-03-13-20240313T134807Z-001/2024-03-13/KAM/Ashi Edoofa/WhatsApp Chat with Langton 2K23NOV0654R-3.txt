20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer

20/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you very much for the time we spend together  wish you well through your working career
26/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Langton ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we are ready we can continue
26/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you every much we are all waiting for that opportunity to receive the offer letter
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's nice we'll organised
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's good to hear hope the journey  will go as planned  and have a chance to live my dreams
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263771184986, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we have received them we can proceed
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's great news to hear
26/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well detailed and noted
26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 77 118 4986: That's fair enough
26/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
26/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Noted and well detailed
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 4:44 PM - +263 77 118 4986: We can continue it's well detailed
26/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 4:51 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes can u please highlight me on that
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure  let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Noted
26/12/23, 5:01 PM - +263 77 118 4986: What if the students  already wrote their A Level
26/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771184986 May I know if you have the results for your A level dear?
26/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I have the results and I have shared them with Shivjeet
26/12/23, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263771184986
26/12/23, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 77 118 4986: No more queries we can proceed
26/12/23, 5:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 5:39 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can proceed
26/12/23, 5:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

26/12/23, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263771184986
30/12/23, 6:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Langton ,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you we can proceed
6/1/24, 1:01 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Sorry my network connection was down

6/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted we can proceed
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 77 118 4986: 1. Annum tuition fee is $350
2. accommodation fee is$0
3. Annual fee is $1600
4. Sport and music fee is $125
5. Admission  fee is $1000
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 77 118 4986: It is really a great offer and much appreciated
6/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that @263771184986 . As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well explained  and well noted
6/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up.

2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund

8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
6/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted
6/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 118 4986: My question is on the admission fee how it is going to be paid and the period
6/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, I will be assisting you regarding the same soon.
6/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
6/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes it is very clear
6/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 118 4986: This clearly show how one can benefit from EWYL programe
6/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
6/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 118 4986: This is also noted
6/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted and how can this fee be paid
6/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 118 4986: In term of period  and installments
6/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 19th, 2024*.
6/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes you can explain in detail
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 118 4986: We noted and clearly understood
6/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 118 4986: I'm in Bulawayo
6/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you I will make sure someone on my behalf will meet him
6/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes please you can provide mewith it
6/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
6/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 118 4986: OK thank you
6/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 118 4986: Wanted to ask about the due date is it very strict  and won't change
6/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, As these deadlines are shared by the university hence it's important to complete the process by the given time
