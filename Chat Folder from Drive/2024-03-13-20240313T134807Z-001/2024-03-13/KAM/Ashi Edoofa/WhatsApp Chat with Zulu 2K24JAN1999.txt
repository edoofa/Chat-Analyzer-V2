1/2/24, 3:01 PM - +260 96 8635206: Good Afternoon 
And Yes i have watched them. From my point of view in Summation the Edoofa Co Founders were explaining that they are in good connection with universities that do not just have owners that make schools for business but have the vision to develop their students together with their community. Then on the part of the student two things were majorly emphasised that these students should be open minded with their decisions pertaining to their surroundings and must follows instructions given by the Edoofan Co founder or universities link to. From my part this is how I can summarise my understanding. 
And Well sir, I guess you may now discuss them firther.
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with me. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
1/2/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
1/2/24, 3:07 PM - +260 96 8635206: I solely agree and understand
1/2/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
1/2/24, 3:08 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes sir we are
1/2/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
1/2/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

1/2/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/2/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
1/2/24, 3:12 PM - +260 96 8635206: I must submit today?
1/2/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You can take your time and submit them by tomorrow
1/2/24, 3:15 PM - +260 96 8635206: Thank you sir and for these questions I must submit the answer in this group isn't it inclusive of the audio messages
1/2/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, You need to write your response in the group and for the first question you can share your voice response
1/2/24, 3:19 PM - +260 96 8635206: That is in the group too isn't it
1/2/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, In the group
1/2/24, 3:25 PM - +260 96 8635206: Alright sir
2/2/24, 11:15 AM - +260 96 8635206: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 11:45 AM - +260 96 8635206: 2. Zambia, with its abundant natural resources and diverse economy, stands at the threshold of significant development. The nation's growth potential lies in harnessing its resources effectively, particularly in the realm of infrastructure and energy. As an aspiring electrical engineer, my role in Zambia's development is pivotal.

Contributing to Zambia's progress involves engaging in projects that address the country's energy challenges. With a focus on renewable energy, i can propel Zambia towards a sustainable future.

By collaborating with local entities, adhering to sustainable practices, and staying abreast of technological advancements, i can carve a path that not only aligns with my career aspirations but also catalyzes Zambia's journey towards comprehensive and inclusive development.

3. Toyota stands as my dream company, driven by its commitment to innovation, sustainability, and quality. I am drawn to Toyota's legacy of pioneering automotive advancements, epitomized by the iconic Toyota Production System and their leadership in hybrid technology with models like the Prius. The company's emphasis on environmental consciousness and dedication to creating products that enhance society aligns with my values. Toyota's global presence provides an opportunity for diverse experiences and a chance to contribute to a brand synonymous with reliability and efficiency. The collaborative and inclusive work culture at Toyota, coupled with its focus on continuous improvement, resonates with my professional aspirations. Working for Toyota would not just be a job; it would be a chance to contribute to a company that has a profound impact on the automotive industry and a commitment to shaping a sustainable future.

4. Electronics and electrical systems are related fields but differ in their focus and application. Electrical systems deal with the generation, transmission, distribution, and use of electrical power. It involves large-scale systems like power plants, transformers, and the electrical grid. Electrical engineering encompasses the study of electromagnetism, power generation, and the overall infrastructure for delivering electricity.

On the other hand, electronics is a branch of electrical engineering that concentrates on small-scale electronic circuits and components. It involves the design and application of devices like transistors, integrated circuits, and microcontrollers. Electronics is more concerned with the manipulation of electrical signals for tasks such as amplification, processing, and transmission of information. It plays a crucial role in creating technologies like computers, smartphones, and various electronic gadgets.

In essence, electrical systems deal with the broader aspects of power generation and distribution, while electronics focuses on smaller-scale electronic components and their applications in creating functional devices.

5. A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy temporarily. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, electrons gather on one plate, creating a negative charge, while the other plate becomes positively charged. This charge separation creates an electric field between the plates.

The dielectric prevents the flow of direct current (DC) between the plates but allows alternating current (AC) or changes in voltage to pass through. When the voltage source is removed, the capacitor retains the stored charge. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic circuits for various purposes, such as smoothing out power supplies, filtering signals, and storing energy for quick release. They play a vital role in regulating electrical signals and ensuring the stability of electronic devices.
2/2/24, 12:18 PM - +260 96 8635206: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zulu, I hope you are doing well!
2/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
2/2/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are ready for today's session ?
2/2/24, 12:32 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes sir
2/2/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (09-Feb-2024). <This message was edited>
2/2/24, 12:37 PM - +260 96 8635206: That is correct
2/2/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/IF5q0eBSWhg6ftVxucJF4l
2/2/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
2/2/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
2/2/24, 12:41 PM - +260 96 8635206: Noted
2/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
2/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 28th February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
2/2/24, 12:45 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes the payment will be ready on the specified date
2/2/24, 12:45 PM - +260 96 8635206: I have sent the message to the EWYL mentor
2/2/24, 12:45 PM - +260 97 7635206: We have put that in mind and we will oblige to that due date
2/2/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
2/2/24, 12:47 PM - +260 96 8635206: Noted
2/2/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Electronics and Electrical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/2/24, 12:48 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes
2/2/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/2/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/2/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/2/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/2/24, 12:51 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes
2/2/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/2/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/2/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/2/24, 12:54 PM - +260 96 8635206: And this fee is Inclusive of the University fee isnt it
2/2/24, 12:54 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes he did
2/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear
2/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/2/24, 12:56 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes we are Sir
2/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
2/2/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
2/2/24, 12:58 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes sir
2/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/2/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/2/24, 1:00 PM - +260 96 8635206: Wow interesting
2/2/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/2/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/2/24, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - +260 96 8635206: Interesting
2/2/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 1:07 PM - +260 96 8635206: So quick question sir... The fees solely depend on the type of scholarship you've received ranging 50%-100% isn't it
2/2/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @260968635206
2/2/24, 1:12 PM - +260 96 8635206: Interesting so the example you've given its biased on what percentage?
2/2/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please note that the above example is based on the experience we have  with the universities.
2/2/24, 1:13 PM - +260 96 8635206: Oh okay noted
2/2/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/2/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
2/2/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/2/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/2/24, 1:16 PM - +260 96 8635206: Gladly sir
2/2/24, 1:16 PM - +260 96 8635206: Wow
2/2/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
2/2/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
2/2/24, 1:18 PM - +260 96 8635206: Very much! Sir
2/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
2/2/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
2/2/24, 1:19 PM - +260 96 8635206: Yes sir
2/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
2/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/2/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/2/24, 1:21 PM - +260 96 8635206: I'm following sir
2/2/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/2/24, 1:24 PM - +260 96 8635206: No queries what so ever
2/2/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright,  are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/2/24, 1:42 PM - +260 96 8635206: Very much
2/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
2/2/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
10/3/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
10/3/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

11/3/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Zulu,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
11/3/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
11/3/24, 12:49 PM - +260 97 7635206: Yes we went through the letter and have some concerns which need clarifications
11/3/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
11/3/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
11/3/24, 1:06 PM - +260 97 7635206: Understood and thanks
11/3/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
11/3/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
11/3/24, 1:29 PM - +260 97 7635206: (1)  1000
(2)  4 yrs 
(3)  300
(4)  750
11/3/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000* 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - +260 97 7635206: Yes
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
11/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2250 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2750 and this includes the food cost as well. <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 1:56 PM - +260 97 7635206: Ok
11/3/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
11/3/24, 1:58 PM - +260 97 7635206: Is this part of scholarship or it's us to pay
11/3/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
11/3/24, 2:04 PM - +260 97 7635206: Clarify more on this one. Is Edoofa going to cater for accommodation and feeding
11/3/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260977635206, The scholarship is provided for your over cost of education
11/3/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
11/3/24, 2:11 PM - +260 97 7635206: I get you now. Was worried about the cost of accommodation and feeding. This means when he comes that side that's when accommodation will be sorted out upon choosing the option
11/3/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry @260977635206, We are all here if you have any doubts, let me guide you that regarding the accommodation you will be assisted before arrival so that everything is sorted. I hope that's clear ?
11/3/24, 2:22 PM - +260 97 7635206: Thank you
11/3/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome @260977635206,  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
11/3/24, 2:25 PM - +260 97 7635206: Yes we are clear
11/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
11/3/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on March 24th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
11/3/24, 2:34 PM - +260 97 7635206: Ok and the 300 falls within 750?
11/3/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No @260977635206, As mentioned above $300 is waived off which means you don't have to pay this amount. This is an advantage of being a Proud Edoofian. Shall we proceed ?
11/3/24, 2:41 PM - +260 97 7635206: Noted and thanks. About the registration fee is it suppose to be paid at once or in two instalments
11/3/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/3/24, 2:45 PM - +260 97 7635206: Infact that was what i was trying to refer to. I noticed that the date line fo paying 750 is 24th march
11/3/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the payment plan for the registration fee. This $750 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$375 before the first deadline date of 24th March, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$375  before the second deadline date of 24th April, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date) <This message was edited>
11/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $750 within 15 working days, before *March 24th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/3/24, 2:48 PM - +260 97 7635206: Very much agreeable
11/3/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/3/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/3/24, 2:50 PM - +260 97 7635206: We are in Zambia
11/3/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
11/3/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

11/3/24, 3:35 PM - +260 97 7635206: Thanks
11/3/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome,  now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000+ $200 + $800 = $3000
11/3/24, 3:41 PM - +260 97 7635206: Noted.
11/3/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/3/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
11/3/24, 3:47 PM - +260 97 7635206: Yes understood
11/3/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
11/3/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
11/3/24, 3:49 PM - +260 97 7635206: Yes
11/3/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
11/3/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to inquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
11/3/24, 3:54 PM - +260 97 7635206: Though we haven't yet gotten the offer letter but only using the one you shared
