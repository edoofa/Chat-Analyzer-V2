6/3/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
6/3/24, 1:10 PM - +263 77 443 9965: Clear

6/3/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps - <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/3/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

6/3/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 443 9965: I have understood that l should be teachable and open minded and l should also follow instructions. I also learnt that Edoofa is cheap and a reliable scholarship program for example the story of the boy from Ghana who was scammed. I understood that l can be independent under the scholarship credits .Edoofa's vision is not just affordable, quality education and makingstudents employable through the SEELS but also increasing my capacity to success and to be more responsible and independent. I understood that I should think outside the box for example the calculator guy that approached the HP owner.Edoofa also surveyed the best schools ,colleges and universities for more than a decade which is impressive. Lastly l understood that the SOP is an important document that should highlight why l should be admitted and should highlight my achievements ,unique point, my vision, academic progress among other factors .
6/3/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 443 9965: That's my understanding
6/3/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding with me, I am glad to see that you have gone through the videos well. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
6/3/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
6/3/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
6/3/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
6/3/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission. <This message was edited>
6/3/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
6/3/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 443 9965: I agree
6/3/24, 4:04 PM - +263 77 443 9965: I understood the above from the videos
6/3/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
6/3/24, 4:07 PM - +263 77 443 9965: We are on the same page
6/3/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

 Entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of innovation. They develop new products, services, and technologies that can drive economic growth. This innovation can lead to increased productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, contributing to economic development.

Successful entrepreneurs can accumulate wealth through their ventures. This wealth creation not only benefits the entrepreneurs themselves but also has a trickle-down effect, stimulating economic activity and contributing to increased standards of living for a broader segment of the population.

Entrepreneurial activities contribute to a country's ability to compete on a global scale. By fostering a culture of innovation and adaptability, a nation can position itself as a player in the global marketplace, attracting investments and boosting economic development. 

Entrepreneurship has the potential to address societal challenges by providing solutions to problems, creating social enterprises, and contributing to community development. 

In summary, entrepreneurship is a driving force behind economic development, fostering innovation, creating jobs, and contributing to the overall growth and prosperity of a nation or region.

GAAP, which stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, refers to a set of standardized accounting principles, standards, and procedures that companies use to compile their financial statements. GAAP provides a common language for financial reporting, ensuring consistency, comparability, and transparency in financial statements. Here are key aspects of GAAP and its importance:

GAAP establishes uniform guidelines for financial reporting, enabling consistency in how companies record and report financial transactions. This consistency is crucial for stakeholders, such as investors and creditors, who rely on financial statements to make informed decisions. It also facilitates the comparability of financial information across different entities and industries.

 GAAP aims to ensure the reliability of financial information by providing a framework for accurate and faithful representation of a company's financial position. It also emphasizes the relevance of financial statements by requiring timely and meaningful disclosure of information that can impact users' decisions.

 GAAP-compliant financial statements provide valuable information for decision-making. Investors, creditors, and other users can analyze financial reports to assess a company's performance, financial health, and potential risks. GAAP helps ensure that the information presented in financial statements is relevant and reliable for decision-making purposes.
7/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 443 9965: 4. Accounting standards are a set of guidelines and rules established by accounting regulatory bodies that dictate how financial statements should be prepared and presented. These standards ensure consistency and comparability in financial reporting, allowing investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Accounting standards are mandatory because they help promote transparency, accuracy, and reliability in financial reporting. By adhering to these standards, companies can provide a clear and accurate picture of their financial performance and position, which in turn helps build trust and confidence among investors and other users of financial information.

Furthermore, mandatory accounting standards help prevent fraud, manipulation, and misrepresentation of financial information. By following these standards, companies are required to disclose relevant information in a consistent manner, making it easier to detect any discrepancies or irregularities.

Overall, accounting standards are essential for maintaining the integrity and credibility of financial reporting, and their mandatory nature ensures that companies comply with best practices and principles in their financial reporting processes.
7/3/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 443 9965: 5. Accounting and auditing are closely related fields within the broader domain of financial management, but they serve distinct purposes and involve different activities. Here's a differentiation between accounting and auditing:

 Accounting is the systematic process of recording, summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting financial transactions of a business. It involves the preparation of financial statements, such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

 The primary purpose of accounting is to provide accurate and timely financial information that helps businesses and stakeholders make informed decisions. Accounting helps in measuring and communicating the financial performance and position of an entity.

Whereas , auditing is the systematic examination of financial information, records, and statements to provide an independent opinion on their fairness and compliance with accounting standards. Auditors assess the reliability and accuracy of financial information.

 The primary purpose of auditing is to provide assurance to stakeholders, such as investors and regulators, that the financial statements are free from material misstatements and are presented in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

In summary, accounting is the broader process of recording, summarizing, and analyzing financial transactions, while auditing is a specialized activity within accounting that involves an independent examination of financial accounting.

12/3/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotebda, Wishing you a wonderful day!
12/3/24, 10:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
12/3/24, 10:08 AM - +263 77 443 9965: I'm available
12/3/24, 10:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response,  As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/3/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/3/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/3/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/3/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 443 9965: Noted
12/3/24, 10:28 AM - +263 77 443 9965: Yes
12/3/24, 10:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/3/24, 10:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/3/24, 10:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

12/3/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/3/24, 10:53 AM - +263 77 443 9965: We are on the same page
12/3/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
12/3/24, 10:54 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?

12/3/24, 10:59 AM - +263 77 443 9965: So is this still valid
12/3/24, 11:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263774439965 The above fees break up I have shared is an example for the range of education cost shared with you in the acceptance letter right ?
12/3/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 443 9965: Yes
12/3/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/3/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

12/3/24, 11:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/3/24, 11:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/3/24, 11:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
12/3/24, 11:33 AM - +263 77 443 9965: I'm excited 😊
12/3/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
12/3/24, 11:34 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
12/3/24, 11:35 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
12/3/24, 11:53 AM - +263 77 443 9965: No
12/3/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
12/3/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
