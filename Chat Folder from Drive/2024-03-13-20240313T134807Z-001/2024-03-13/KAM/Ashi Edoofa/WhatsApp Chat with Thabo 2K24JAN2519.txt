Checking soil fertility involves assessing these factors to understand the soil's health and its capacity to support plant growth.
One common method to check soil fertility is through soil testing.soil samples are collected from different areas and sent to a laboratory for analysis.The results provide information about the nutrients levels, pH and recommendations for any necessary amendments.
To improve soil fertility, several strategies can be employed.adding organic matter such as compost or manure enriches the soil with essential nutrients and improves its structure . Crop rotation helps prevent nutrients depletion and reduces the risk of pests and disease. Using cover crops can also enhance soil fertility by preventing erosion, increasing organic matter and fixing nitrogen.
Applying fertilizers based on soil test recommendations ensures that plants receives the necessary nutrients. It is important to use fertilizers judiciously and follow recommended application rates to avoid nutrients imbalances or environmental pollution.
Conversation practices like mulching, terracing and contour plowing help conserve soil moisture, prevent erosion and maintenan soil fertility. And additionally practicing sub stainable agriculture techniques like  crop diversification, integrated pest management and water management contribution to long term soil fertility.
By implementing these practices, soil fertility can be improved, leading to healthier plants, increased crop yields, and substainal agriculture systems.

To kick start the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
10/3/24, 2:48 PM - +260 97 7418333: Good afternoon
11/3/24, 9:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Thabo, I hope you had a good weekend! 

I am pleased to connect with you today to move ahead with your admission journey, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
11/3/24, 9:55 AM - +260 97 4333579: Yes
11/3/24, 10:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are ready for the discussion Thabo, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Agriculture)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/3/24, 11:05 AM - +260 97 4333579: Yes
11/3/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/3/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/3/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/3/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/3/24, 11:49 AM - +260 97 7418333: Yes
11/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/3/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I have been looking forward for your response to move ahead with your admission journey, As my operational hours are over for today. We will connect tomorrow at 10:00 am, I hope you will be available for the discussion
11/3/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
12/3/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Thabo, Wishing you a wonderful day
12/3/24, 10:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
12/3/24, 12:43 PM - +260 97 4333579: I'm particularly available today cause of the celebration. It's youth day
12/3/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Happy Youth day @260974333579 !!
12/3/24, 2:38 PM - +260 97 4333579: Thank you very much. It means a lot to me
12/3/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcom dear, Please do let me know when you would like to start our session.
12/3/24, 2:45 PM - +260 97 4333579: It can start now I'm home
12/3/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, May I know if you have gone through my above messages ?
12/3/24, 2:55 PM - +260 97 4333579: Yes
12/3/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
