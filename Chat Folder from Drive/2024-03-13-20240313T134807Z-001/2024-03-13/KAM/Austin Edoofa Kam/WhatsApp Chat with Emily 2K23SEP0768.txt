16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emily

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings dear parents and Emily
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence, I request you to come online at *12:00 pm CAT today* and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.
24/1/24, 12:21 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings to you all!
I am here to guide you through the further proceedings of the program and guide you ahead

Are you available to begin?
24/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Yes we may
24/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Emily! 

How is your day progressing?
25/1/24, 6:21 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

31/1/24, 2:37 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Afternoon Emily!
How is your day progressing?
31/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 293 4866: My day is good
31/1/24, 2:38 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This message was deleted

31/1/24, 2:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  So, are you available for the same?
31/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
31/1/24, 2:59 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to know, At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

31/1/24, 2:59 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
31/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 293 4866: We are currently having troubles in looking for the money required to pursue my education further
31/1/24, 3:31 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand, Emily!

31/1/24, 3:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 71 293 4866: I don't know them
31/1/24, 4:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is alright and I will help you connect to Edoofians after our sessions
31/1/24, 4:04 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
31/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 293 4866: I don't know why
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 4:07 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
31/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
31/1/24, 4:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
31/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Yes it is
31/1/24, 4:27 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
31/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 71 293 4866: I don't think I still remember can you please remind me
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with an understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as I will be recommending your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on the same. Now, let us assume,
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
31/1/24, 4:34 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
31/1/24, 5:12 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Yes I am
31/1/24, 5:15 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me please?

29/2/24, 1:35 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Absolutely, we have a dedicated *Department of Student Welfare* who will be guiding you throughout your journey in India starting from your arrival at the airport
29/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 293 4866: So they will be the ones guiding us

29/2/24, 2:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: No please, it will be a part of the cost of education which means, you are supposed to pay only the remaining once you are here in India. Basically, you are going to pay part of the first year fee itself
29/2/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Okay thank you
29/2/24, 2:54 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask me please?
29/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 293 4866: Nothing for now
29/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 293 4866: So what is the total amount needed from tuition to traveling expenses
29/2/24, 3:01 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you step by step!
In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 293 4866: 1.$350
2.0
3.$1 600
4.$250
5.$1000
29/2/24, 3:50 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Work, Emily!
29/2/24, 3:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University.
29/2/24, 3:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
