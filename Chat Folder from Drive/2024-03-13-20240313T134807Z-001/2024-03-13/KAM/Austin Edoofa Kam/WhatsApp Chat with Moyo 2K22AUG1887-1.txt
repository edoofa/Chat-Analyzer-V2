16/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moyo,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

16/1/24, 11:06 AM - +27 64 128 8442: Good morning
16/1/24, 9:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 9:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Sahil, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 9:12 PM - +27 64 128 8442: Okay

24/1/24, 8:47 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 10:34 AM - +27 64 128 8442: Good morning sir
After receiving the university letter we sat down and we discussed, the issue is that I'm the only one working and paying fees for children and supporting them financially and my salary is +-R4500 so it is not enough for me to take Nokwakha to India.
24/1/24, 10:35 AM - +27 64 128 8442: She will study in Zimbabwe but I'm not yet sure which university am I going to afford
24/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand your situation, and I appreciate your openness in discussing it. Considering the financial constraints, have you had a chance to research the cost of studying locally in Zimbabwe?
24/1/24, 10:40 AM - +27 64 128 8442: Nokwakha did some of the research
24/1/24, 10:43 AM - +27 64 128 8442: So we are hoping that so far India failed we will manage MSU, unless if you have another way of helping her
24/1/24, 10:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 1:42 PM - +27 64 128 8442: What was received from India became too much for me because the monthly rental fees for accommodation was $2000 of which it's my 10 months salary so thas why I had to ask if I get back the the registration fee maybe it could help me
24/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know what monthly budget have you allocated for your child's tertiary education ?

27/2/24, 2:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
27/2/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 497 1593: Okay Sir
27/2/24, 4:21 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: By when can you share please?
27/2/24, 8:05 PM - +263 78 497 1593: 1 tuition after scholarahip- $900
2  starndard duration of the course -5years
3 Admission and procedure fee -$300
4 Registration fee -$750

I think thats how I understood it Sir
28/2/24, 12:11 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
28/2/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir it does, thank you
29/2/24, 9:03 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/2/24, 9:03 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

* You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

* If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 497 1593: Okay Sir thank you so much
I understand verywell
29/2/24, 9:19 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
29/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir loud and clear
I really appreciate them because they give us a chance to choose an accomodation that we afford
29/2/24, 9:23 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
29/2/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir I noticed that
Thank you
29/2/24, 9:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on 29 FEB 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
29/2/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir
So since I havent paid anything it means I will hve to go to India nextyear?
29/2/24, 12:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How much amount can you pay in next 7 days ?

2/3/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to know, In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
2/3/24, 12:10 PM - +27 64 128 8442: Tuition fee $350
Accommodation fee $0
Annual fee $1600 
Sports fee $125
Admission fee $575
2/3/24, 12:33 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The Sports and Misc fees add upto $250 and Admissions fee is $1000
2/3/24, 12:35 PM - +27 64 128 8442: Okay I understand
2/3/24, 12:37 PM - +27 64 128 8442: So I have to pay $1000 within 15 days?
2/3/24, 12:37 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University.
2/3/24, 12:38 PM - +27 64 128 8442: This is great
2/3/24, 12:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
2/3/24, 12:40 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you? <This message was edited>
2/3/24, 12:45 PM - +27 64 128 8442: So as of this year it's $R1800 excluding the administration fee, if we add the administration fee it becomes $2800
2/3/24, 12:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: No please, the Registration fee is a part of the mentioned cost of education itself. It is not an addition
2/3/24, 12:51 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India.
2/3/24, 12:52 PM - +27 64 128 8442: Meaning I have to pay 1800
2/3/24, 12:52 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct!
2/3/24, 12:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The total fee for the first year would be $1850, there was a calculation error here which has been rectfied
2/3/24, 12:53 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This cost is inclusive of the registration fee
2/3/24, 12:58 PM - +27 64 128 8442: Will they allow me to be paying any amount that I get so that I can secure her place, so far I don't have any servings I lost my job towards the end of last year
2/3/24, 1:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I can understand and how much are you planning to pay towards the registration fee initially?
2/3/24, 1:33 PM - +27 64 128 8442: As I'm speaking now I only have R2000
4/3/24, 8:31 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Morning to you @27641288442 !
