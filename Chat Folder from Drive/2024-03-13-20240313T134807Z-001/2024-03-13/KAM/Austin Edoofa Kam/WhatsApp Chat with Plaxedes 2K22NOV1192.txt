16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Plaxedes ,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:31 PM - +263 77 690 6202: How are you Mr Millan
She will send results soon
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 679 8904: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Austin, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parent and Plaxedes @263776798904 @263772214487 ,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead. <This message was edited>

She will get in touch @11:30
23/1/24, 11:47 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day dear parent and Plaxedes
Hope you are doing well

As informed yesterday, I am here to guide you further in your university registration process. 

Are you ready to begin?
23/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Sorry lm late
23/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes let's begin
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good to hear from you, Plaxedes!
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 12:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: *Congratulations on your good A-level results* At the same time, I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.

May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you Mr Austin lm.very glad to have this conversation  with you so the reason why  l wasn't able to complete with the university registration  process is because my parents  could not afford the $700 which was required
As far as l remember  the last time l.had the conversation  with him he was not pleased with the idea of me learning abroad but   he is trying to fix something he will.respond once  he is online

Thank you sir
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I really understand the challenges,Plaxedes
We are associated with more than 300 schools in Zimbabwe, with 2500+ beneficiaries and their happy families which means we are aware of the economic constraints, challenges and hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and I have decided to assist you in person to guide you through most affordable opportunities!
23/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: At the same time, do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for the Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities in Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

*I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 679 8904: I will get back to you once l.talk with my parents
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Sure Plaxedes, by when can I expect your feedback as I have been planning to recommend your application for a 100% scholarship on tuition and even a sponsorship on Accommodation thereby even self-financing your education through the EWYL program. The 100% scholarship seats are very limited and we are overwhelmed with applicants!
23/1/24, 3:44 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, I am expecting a feedback at the earliest so that I can guide you through the best possible opportunities
23/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Oky sir
23/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 679 8904: My parents said you can go ahead with the process sir
23/1/24, 4:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Plaxedes!
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Oky thank you

23/1/24, 4:46 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Plaxedes
23/1/24, 4:47 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yah l.know sir
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Great!
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Therefore, It is important to know the facts of Edoofa's guidance and uniqueness compared to the normal University approach.

1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:-* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:-* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

23/1/24, 5:25 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: These are aspects that no other organization or University possesses as of now, I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
24/1/24, 6:07 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I have been looking forward to hearing from you yesterday.

24/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes lam sir
24/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Woow this was great

I'm inspired
24/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes sir
24/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Sorry sir lm.late can we begin
24/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Welcome to the session, Plaxedes!
24/1/24, 12:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand
24/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you sir
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
24/1/24, 1:23 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes its accurate
24/1/24, 1:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
24/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Mmm l can't  remember can you enlighten me sir
24/1/24, 1:38 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
24/1/24, 1:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
24/1/24, 1:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
24/1/24, 1:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be subtracted from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.
24/1/24, 1:39 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
24/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 679 8904: It's clear but you said you will.help.me yo acquire 100% scholarship
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Indeed Plaxedes, Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition and even sponsorship on Accommodation.
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: You will further have the Earn While You Learn Program to reduce the costs and even self finance your higher education
25/1/24, 6:22 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I have been looking forward to hearing from you, Plaxedes
25/1/24, 6:23 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 8:09 AM - +263 77 679 8904: Oky

25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I am doing well, Plaxedes!
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Are you clear with the same?
25/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Yes
25/1/24, 1:16 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
25/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 679 8904: For.the mean time they don't have the money
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I understand Plaxedes and by when is your family planning to be prepared towards the registration fees?
25/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 679 8904: I'm.not yet sure
25/1/24, 3:58 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Plaxedes, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize the challenges and your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?

11/3/24, 11:52 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1640

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are three components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee, the Misc. Fee and Medical Insurance. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1640 (tuition) + $250 (fees) +$50(uniform)= $1940

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1640. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

11/3/24, 12:45 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1940 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $940 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
11/3/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 679 8904: So if l.pay $1000 l will only be left with $940?
11/3/24, 1:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is correct, Plaxedes!
11/3/24, 1:26 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
11/3/24, 1:27 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: However, based on my discussions and assessment of your application, it was ensured to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
11/3/24, 2:02 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose
11/3/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 679 8904: Noted sir
