I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students and through the Edoofa Scholarship, you have a sponsorship on *On-Campus Accommodation*. Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community

6. Water Bill

12/3/24, 11:09 AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $1000 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $1000 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining tuition fee that you will be required to pay after Stacey arrives in India will be 0 because you would have already paid and will be left with the Exam fee, ERP, Uniform, and Miscellaneous as mentioned in the letter. The cost of food will be around $250 per year. <This message was edited>
