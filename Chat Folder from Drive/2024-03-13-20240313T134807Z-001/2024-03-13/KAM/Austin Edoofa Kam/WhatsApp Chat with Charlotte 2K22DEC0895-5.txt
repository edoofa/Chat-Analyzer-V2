8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

Also, you are talking to *Miss Siddhi*. I believe you must have mistakenly addressed me as sir.
8/1/24, 3:01 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Your message in fact made me think about the opportunities and improvements one can make with the start of a new year. The new year is indeed a blessing, it may not bring immediate transformation, yet it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves.

This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 187 1838: My apologies mam .
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is completely alright, dear. It was an honest mistake. I believe you were also able to go through my 2nd message regarding the resolutions you have for this year? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 187 1838: I haven't really decided yet but after Friday the 12th this week when my results are out l will choose the right path to take
8/1/24, 4:32 PM - +263 77 187 1838: But l  have also added my education by engaging in free courses offered by the united Nations it is really an amazing journey
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that, dear. Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 5:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 77 187 1838: Mam l reached the admission officer  early August  but they responded in early September
8/1/24, 5:39 PM - +263 77 187 1838: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 8:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I see, dear. There must have been some misunderstanding due to which we were unable go forward with your admission process. However, I am relieved that we are connected now and we can proceed with your university application process to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat with the best university for your education. May I know if now is a good to go ahead with it? <This message was edited>

9/1/24, 8:32 AM - +263 77 187 1838: Yes it is mam
9/1/24, 9:18 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward, Charlotte.

According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
16/1/24, 8:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Charlotte,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 8:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
22/1/24, 2:30 PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day, dear parents and Charlotte,
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*

Hence I request you to come online at the earliest and notify me so that I can guide you ahead.
