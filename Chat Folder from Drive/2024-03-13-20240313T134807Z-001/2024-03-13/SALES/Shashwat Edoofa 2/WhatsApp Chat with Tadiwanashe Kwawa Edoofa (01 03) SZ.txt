12/03/24, 5:50 pm - +263 71 475 1076: Well first of all my name is Tadiwanashe Kwawa. I'm a passionate young man whos dream is to be a doctor. I came from a poor background of 5 members. Three children and two parents. My parents worked hard to get me through secondary and high school but now they are unemployed due to unforseen circumstances. I did my O'level at Mufakose High 2 where l did ten subjects and my results are as follows:
Mathematics - A
Biology - B
Chemistry - B
Physics - C
Combimed Science - A
History -A
Heritage - A
English - A
Shona - A
Geography - C
I was happy with the results l had at O'Level. I then did my A'level at Mufakose high 1 where l specialised in sciences namely Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry. When results came out i had an A ,A and a B respectively. During my time at Mufakose high 1 I was a chessplayer, vice captain to be precise and a quiz participant. I enyoyed the two activities because they were refreshing and mind-puzzling. Now my passion lies in studying medicine and becoming a doctor ,a surgeon to be much precise. This has been my dream and ambition and l intend to make it a reality for the love and compassion i have towards the sick and needy is indescribable. As l mentioned earlier , l came from a poor background such that we could not afford medicine but rather tend to natural herbs which inturn was risky as we did not know the correct procedures. My parents are wishing the best for me. At the moment they are unemployed. My mothers highest qualification is her experience as a sale's person whereas my fathers highest profession is his' experience as a sale's manager. In a nutshell this is who l am and what l aspire to be
