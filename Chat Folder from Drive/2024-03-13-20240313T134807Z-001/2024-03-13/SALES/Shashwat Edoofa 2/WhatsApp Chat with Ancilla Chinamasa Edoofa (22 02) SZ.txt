Are you ready?
29/02/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 066 7377: Yes
29/02/24, 9:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ancilla!
29/02/24, 9:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read the information provided in the document, please?
29/02/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 066 7377: Yes sir
29/02/24, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly provide me with a comprehensive overview of your understanding of the document, please?
29/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 066 7377: Ok
01/03/24, 9:30 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Sir there is a problem of network right here sorry for late response let me give you the summary of that document
01/03/24, 9:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 9:50 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Thank you Sir.Have a blessed weekend
05/03/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Goodafternoon Sir from that document l understand that firstly,a fully funded scholarship is a scholarship in which a philanthropist/charitable organization or government body sponsors a student right from the application to education and living expenses.
05/03/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Moreover, not everyone can get a fully funded scholarship ,the reason is there are few genuine charitable/philanthropic organizations,also students cannot buy a scholarship nor can get it by showing that they are poor and needy .A scholarship can 9nly be earned on the basis of merit ,talent and attitude.
05/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Subsequently,students get to earn scholarship credits right from their first year in the university by being engaged in part-time online projects and tasks along with their degree program,this helps them to reduce their college fees as well as gaining a valuable experience.Edoofa helps to provide scholarships on tuition fee and the quantum of the scholarship depends on the student's performance in the interview with the program director as well as merit and academic background,statement of purpose etch
12/03/24, 8:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I sincerely hope this message finds you in good health. I regret to inform you that I faced a delay in reaching out to you due to the passing of my grandparent, and my focus was on attending to the necessary rituals during this challenging time. I would like to propose *reconnecting at 10:00 A.M. CAT* to resume our sessions. Your understanding and consideration in this matter are highly appreciated. Wishing you a blessed day ahead.
12/03/24, 8:16 am - +263 78 066 7377: Thank you Sir
12/03/24, 8:32 am - +27 84 373 4652: Morning sorry the loss of your grandparent

12/03/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 066 7377: *Experience a different culture*

One of my biggest motivation behind studying abroad is the chance to experience another culture that's entirely different from my own.This enriching experience will help me to see things in different perspective
12/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 066 7377: <Media omitted>

12/03/24, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Ancilla! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

12/03/24, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: While there isn't a distinct degree dedicated solely to 'Social Work,' it is primarily a profession or vocational pursuit. Aspiring social workers can embark on this path with a diverse range of academic backgrounds. Nevertheless, when considering the initial steps toward a career in social work, it is customary for students to opt for degrees in fields such as Sociology or Law. May I know what intrigues you more, please?
12/03/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 066 7377: Alright Sir
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 066 7377: My career aspirations are centered on constant growth and skill enhancement
