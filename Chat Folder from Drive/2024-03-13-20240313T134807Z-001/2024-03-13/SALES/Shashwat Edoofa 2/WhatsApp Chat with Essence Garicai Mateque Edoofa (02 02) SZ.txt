27/02/24, 1:28 pm - +258 85 603 1870: Becoming a neurosurgeon has been my dream since I was 5 years old because I used to have headaches and whenever I used to go to hospital the doctors would tell me that I need to see a neurosurgeon.

01/03/24, 10:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
01/03/24, 3:36 pm - +258 85 603 1870: Thank you sir I didn't know

I regret to inform you that I faced a delay in reaching out to you due to the passing of my grandparent, and my focus was on attending to the necessary rituals during this challenging time. I would like to propose *reconnecting at 10:00 A.M. CAT* to resume our sessions. Your understanding and consideration in this matter are highly appreciated. Wishing you a blessed day ahead.

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - +258 85 603 1870: No I am not familiar with it may you kindly tell me sir
12/03/24, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Essence! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/03/24, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/03/24, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 4:12 pm - +258 85 603 1870: I can say yes, since it can be reduced with EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM
12/03/24, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Essence. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/03/24, 4:17 pm - +258 85 603 1870: I don't  know, may you kindly tell me <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 6:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Essence. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/03/24, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
