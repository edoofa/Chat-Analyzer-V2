21/02/24, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
21/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 434 0855: That's wonderful,  thank you
21/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 434 0855: I'm a single mother of 3 wonderful boys, Simbarashe Chipendo, Makomborero Chipendo and Kupakwashe Chipendo with Simbarashe being my first born.

21/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 434 0855: What motivates me to support my son (all of my sons) is that I know the value of education in one's life. I want my kids to lead decent successful lives despite coming from a background of being raised by a single mum.
21/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 434 0855: Simbarashe is a hard working student and a well behaved young man who is very loving, caring and responsible. From a very early age, I noticed Simbarashe displaying some mature and responsible behavior in him. I can say one of Simbarashe's weaknesses is that of worry,  wanting to take up every little family responsibilities and every big family responsibilities all to himself, I believe he believes as the first born the family responsibilities lies on him, though I have been trying to explain to him that there is a time for everything and right now he needs to concentrate on his studies. <This message was edited>
21/02/24, 10:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am deeply impressed by your remarkable journey as a single mother, raising three wonderful boys – Simbarashe, Makomborero, and Kupakwashe, with Simbarashe being your firstborn. I want to express my utmost admiration and respect for you as a single mother. Your resilience and strength in navigating the challenges of parenthood on your own are truly commendable. The love and care you provide for your children, coupled with your unwavering dedication to their well-being and success, showcase your extraordinary commitment as a mother. Your ability to juggle responsibilities, make sacrifices, and create a nurturing environment for your family is nothing short of remarkable.

Currently they are all learning at Gutu High School as day scholars living with my parents. Gutu is my hometown.
21/02/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 434 0855: My parents going in their 80s now

21/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 434 0855: I wish they could both get scholarships so they can really focus on their education without any worries. My kids are all bright students I thank God for that.
21/02/24, 1:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Simbarashe's education abroad?
21/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 434 0855: I will do all I can to support my boy.
21/02/24, 1:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Joan. You are an extraordinary parent, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Simbarashe's well-being is truly admirable! <This message was edited>

21/02/24, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Ms. Joan! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
21/02/24, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Simbarashe Chipendo Edoofa (15/02) SZ" to "Simbarashe Chipendo Edoofa (15/02) SZ 2025"
21/02/24, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share his A-Level previous term results as well, please?
21/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 434 0855: That is very true
21/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 434 0855: That's alright let me try to organize that since he has his school report in Gutu
21/02/24, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Ms. Joan. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share the results in a textual format, please?
21/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 434 0855: I don't think it's a problem since today it's a national holiday in Zimbabwe he can  liaise with someone with a phone on whatsapp and send me for onwards submission to you
21/02/24, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Ms. Joan. Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please?

21/02/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 434 0855: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Kindly take note that the printed subjects on school report does not reflect Crop Science henceforth his results recorded under Agriculture
21/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 434 0855: His combination is Crop Science, Geography and Biology
21/02/24, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Congratulations on Simbarashe's remarkable achievement of scoring straight A's in his exams! His dedication, hard work, and intellectual prowess have truly set him apart. Achieving such excellence requires not only intelligence but also resilience and a strong commitment to his studies. His academic success reflects not only his innate abilities but also the discipline and perseverance he has exhibited throughout his educational journey!
21/02/24, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding Simbarashe's career aspirations more vividly, please?
21/02/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Initially he grew up wanting to be a pilot😊 but circumstances kind of robbed him when he didn't do very well in his O level. However, when I spoke to him early last year, he pointed out to me that he is also interested in public health
21/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Thank you very much!
21/02/24, 10:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 8:47 am - +263 77 434 0855: Good morning! This is good
22/02/24, 9:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The expert in anything was once a beginner." - Helen Hayes*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
22/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 434 0855: You can start I will be available here and there as I'm working also but will definitely participate
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ms. Joan!
22/02/24, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates Simbarashe the most and the origins of his interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited his fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
22/02/24, 9:04 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Good evening! My apologies for responding late, I had an unexpected busy and long day. Simbarashe generally is a caring person so when he pointed out that he was interested in public health it didn't surprise me because he is someone who values human life, he loves taking care of his family and friends. My Mother is diabetic and at some point in time she experienced a  serious attack and he witnessed everything unfolding, being someone who is very much in love with his grandmother and living in rural areas where the health system is not good I could see it really disturbed him as he shared with me how he wished he could do something to improve the situation, promote health and change people's lives in the rural area. I feel He will take up the course in Public Healthy  passionately. It could have been good if he was able to be part of these sessions actively participating.
27/02/24, 12:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I sincerely apologize for not reaching out to you in a timely manner. Our office was closed from Friday to Monday, and I regret any inconvenience this may have caused. Additionally, I had sent a message on Thursday, but unfortunately, due to network issues, the message was not delivered. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated.
27/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Well understood, how are you
27/02/24, 1:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Simbarashe's interest in public health is not only commendable but also deeply reflective of his compassionate and caring nature. It comes as no surprise considering his values centered around human life and his genuine love for taking care of family and friends. Living in rural areas, where healthcare systems may face challenges, has only intensified his desire to make a positive difference. His expressed wish to contribute to improving the situation and promoting health in such environments underscores a selfless dedication to changing lives for the better. It's evident that his aspirations are rooted in a genuine desire to bring about meaningful impact and create positive transformations in the lives of those in need. Simbarashe's altruistic spirit and commitment to public health are truly praiseworthy!
27/02/24, 1:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Simbarashe's innate caring nature and genuine concern for human life, as evidenced by his interest in public health, make him a remarkable individual. His love for taking care of family and friends, coupled with his firsthand experience witnessing a serious health incident involving your diabetic mother, reflects a deep emotional connection to healthcare challenges in rural areas. It's evident that Simbarashe is genuinely disturbed by the limitations of the current health system and harbors a sincere desire to make a positive impact. Pursuing a course in Public Health, specifically BSc Cardiovascular Technology or Medical Laboratory Technology, would provide him with the knowledge and skills needed to actively contribute to healthcare improvements. These programs are designed to empower individuals to address real-world health challenges, aligning perfectly with Simbarashe's aspirations. His active participation in these sessions could be a transformative experience, allowing him to channel his passion for promoting health and changing lives in rural areas. Encouraging Simbarashe to pursue BSc CVT or MLT could not only align with his compassionate nature but also offer a meaningful pathway to making a tangible difference in the field of public health. May I know which course intrigues you more, please?
27/02/24, 4:45 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Good afternoon! My apologies for a late response, I was trying to get hold of Simbarashe and allow him to make his own independent choice as to which one excites him most between the 2 undergraduate programs. It is BSc. Cardiovascular Technology. In his own words "everything about a human body and a human life is connected to the heart Mama, so it's really important for me to study more on Cardiovascular Technology and promote healthy hearts and healthy lives Mama"

12/03/24, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The only source of knowledge is experience." - Albert Einstein*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 434 0855: Sure let's begin
12/03/24, 11:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly appreciate the sentiment, Ms. Joan🙏🏼🙏🏼
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
12/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 434 0855: You're most welcome
12/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 434 0855: Ooh yes I have
12/03/24, 12:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Simbarashe to India for his higher studies!
12/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Definitely
12/03/24, 12:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
12/03/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 434 0855: The cost for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship is just way too expensive, not affordable to ordinary people.
12/03/24, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ms. Joan! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 434 0855: That's great
12/03/24, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please? <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 434 0855: $2000-$3000 per year is reasonable especially with earn while you learn program
12/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Experiencing poor network
12/03/24, 2:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ms. Joan. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 434 0855: That is wonderful,  I am not so sure how that is done perhaps through engaging students in work-study related programs were an institution offers the student(s) work to do within the University and gain scholarship credits. So maybe if you can enlighten me there
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ms. Joan. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child? <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 434 0855: This is well understood
12/03/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 434 0855: Indeed this will be very beneficial to my child and thank you for offering Edoofians such awesome opportunities
12/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
12/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
12/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/03/24, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

12/03/24, 6:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
12/03/24, 6:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
