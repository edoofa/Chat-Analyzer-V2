I regret to inform you that I faced a delay in reaching out to you due to the passing of my grandparent, and my focus was on attending to the necessary rituals during this challenging time. I would like to propose *reconnecting at 10:00 A.M. CAT* to resume our sessions. Your understanding and consideration in this matter are highly appreciated. Wishing you a blessed day ahead.
12/03/24, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,
