I wish to enhance her career prospects in a global market and allow personal growth and independence. 

She will also have access to specialised programmes or expert faculty and get an indepth cultural immersion and understanding. 

Most importantly, l wish her to build and expand her international networks and connections with other students and professionals..

She will complete her advanced level after this year's ZIMSEC Examinations.

I will send you her O level results soon after I collected them from her previous high school.

01/03/24, 10:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Ekem! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
