28/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Yes sir lets start the session
28/02/24, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your daughter is, what are her strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
28/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Let me draft that sir
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 391 3186: I'm  a man born in the remote rural areas of Beitbridge.  I have completed my Ordinary level form 4 and did a Pastoring coarse. 
Tsivhudzo is the daughter of my young brother who has disappeared and left the wife with three children. 
We don't know about his  whereabouts its been about 15years now we have not heard about him.
She was helped to complete her A level education by CAMFED donor since 2018 doing form one upto Alevel.
CAMFED organisation is now not clear about assisting her further in her education.
Tsivhudzo has passed her Alevel with 10 points.She has approved the potential to achieve great goals.
She is a hardworker who is not lazy in reading books and facing new challenges.
I therefore feel and trust her potential to achieve great goals in her life.
I am sure she can be the future best assert for the family ,community and the country.

Tsivhudzo's weaknesses are that ,like someone who grew up in rural remote areas ,she may fail to mix well with foreigners ,however l believe she can still cope up as time goes .She is also someone who is very quite and reserved.


Her mother Gloria Ncube being the biological parent left to look after the three children ,she has nothing to get them educated.She is not working and in terms of learning she ended at Form 3.She didn't manage to reach Olevel .
28/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Tsivhudzo is now staying with me trying to assist her on how she can go ahead with her education and achieve her goals.
28/02/24, 1:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I extend my sincere condolences and sympathies to you and your family during this challenging time. The disappearance of your young brother, leaving his wife with three children, is undoubtedly a distressing situation. The absence of information regarding his whereabouts for the past 15 years adds a layer of uncertainty and concern. In formalizing support, it is crucial to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. If deemed appropriate, seeking professional advice or assistance may offer valuable insights, Mr. Oria.
28/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Really its distressful
28/02/24, 1:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Tsivhudzo's academic achievements, securing 10 points in her A-levels, reflect not only her dedication but also her tremendous potential for future success. Her commendable work ethic, demonstrated through her diligence in reading and facing challenges, positions her as a proactive and determined individual. Your trust in her ability to achieve great goals is well-placed, and her aspirations to become an invaluable asset to family, community, and country are truly inspiring. Despite any challenges, her commitment shines through. Understanding her background, growing up in rural areas, and being reserved in nature, only adds to the testament of her resilience. It is heartening to see the support you provide, stepping in to assist in her education and goal attainment, particularly considering Mrs. Gloria's challenges. Could you kindly shed light on the profession you pertain to, please?
28/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 391 3186: The children are just left with one parent and lonely without help. Just depending on being hired to work for other locals and given food in return
28/02/24, 1:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I express sincere concern and sympathy for the plight of the children, who find themselves in the difficult circumstance of being left with a single parent and experiencing feelings of loneliness. The reliance on occasional work for other locals in exchange for sustenance highlights a poignant reality that warrants attention and support. Observing such challenges is disheartening, and I trust that appropriate assistance and interventions can be facilitated to create a more stable and nurturing environment for the children, Mr. Oria. May I know who is financially supporting Tsivhudzo with her education, please?
28/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 391 3186: A donor called CAMFED standing for campaign for female education had helped her since form 1 till A level but now it is not showing up to help her on further education
28/02/24, 1:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Tsivhudzo's education abroad?
28/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 391 3186: She has noone to support her financial but mental and with advise including corrections I will stand with her
28/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Financial I have a bigger family to look after also I may not be able to
28/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Maybe we also to know the amounts involved
28/02/24, 3:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Tsivhudzo has expressed her aspiration to pursue her tertiary education abroad, and I truly commend her decision, as it's a pivotal step towards enhancing her employability. I would respectfully suggest that you engage in a thoughtful conversation with your family about the financial aspects of this endeavor. Once you've had the opportunity to do so, please feel free to reach out to me. I will be eagerly awaiting your response.
28/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 391 3186: Its fine let me do so
28/02/24, 7:53 pm - +263 77 391 3186: There are not many people to talk to besides her mother and my wife.  When we discussed the issue we failed to see how we can assist her. Unless maybe if she gets a piece job or her mother gets a job and try to raise the money for her. However we failed to know where or what type of job she could get. 
This made us feel the pain of being what we are because a potential child like Tsivhudzo was lucky to get assistance unfortunately we are failing to meet the least requirements for her to successfully use the opportunity. 
Well we can't blame anyone for our failures  though the girl had the ability and potential.  We don't know if you know of any other chance please don't forget us.
