So shall we start the session?
12/03/24, 10:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 698 4970: I understand that you have so many school institutions which are in partner with .
12/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 698 4970: I also did my own research and l have come to find out that most students who enroll for the Edoofian scholar  come to a situation where they fund themselves paying for their own tuition for the next semester  or team . Instead of the program paying for their fees and everything.
12/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 698 4970: So l would like to ask how far true is that.
12/03/24, 12:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on your concerns, please?
12/03/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Oky let me clarify on what l understand . Please answer yes or no
12/03/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Is it true that  you offer scholarships that are fully funded.  Am asking in terms of paying for the students fees throughout their whole learning experience
12/03/24, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what is your understanding of the term "Fully Funded Scholarship", please?
12/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Fully funded meaning everything is paid for usually including accomodation
12/03/24, 12:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/03/24, 12:47 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Oky now l understand
12/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 698 4970: I guess we can start
12/03/24, 1:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That's the spirit! Now being your Counselor, I would like to know you better as a student so please tell me more about yourself. Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
12/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Okay my name is Emma Jose and l am a Upper 6 student at  Eveline High School which is in the Bulawayo District
12/03/24, 1:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly answer the other questions as well, please?

I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!

12/03/24, 1:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether Mrs. Sibusisiwe is associated with any school, please?
12/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 698 4970: Yes she is
12/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 698 4970: I would like to kept it confidential
12/03/24, 1:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Emma. However, I would like to gently bring to your attention the importance of the information provided, especially during the VISA processing, where accuracy holds paramount significance. Your cooperation in ensuring the precision of details is immensely valuable for the smooth facilitation of the international education process. Moreover, given our extensive association with over 250 schools, there exists the potential for the school where she teaches to be affiliated with us, allowing for certain benefits to be availed. I am here to guide you through this process, and your collaboration is greatly appreciated.
