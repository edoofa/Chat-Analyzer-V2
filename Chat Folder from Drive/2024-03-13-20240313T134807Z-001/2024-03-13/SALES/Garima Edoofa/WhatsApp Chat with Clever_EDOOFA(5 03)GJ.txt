11/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 217 0176: Understood 🤝
11/03/24, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @263772170176 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
11/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 217 0176: I don't have any.
11/03/24, 12:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

11/03/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for you and your family?
11/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 217 0176: I only heard about it by my friend who's there doing law.
11/03/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 217 0176: Umm we can't afford that's too much.
11/03/24, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772170176 I would like to tell you every course has a different fee structure.
11/03/24, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges you are facing?
11/03/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 217 0176: My father's salary can't match the amount needed.
11/03/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 217 0176: How much per semester for my course
11/03/24, 8:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
