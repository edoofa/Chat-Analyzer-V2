02/03/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 388 8648: In my own opinion, to southern african countires like mine which is zimbabwe death toll is on the peak all because of idle minds.
(1) drug abuse is one of the major causes of deaths in zimbabwe
(2)crime rate is up by a 6-8% from the last two years since a lot of people have lost their jobs post COVID 19 era. And 58 percent is unemployed.

So to cape it all i think the introduction of this programme is an aide to
(1) curb  unemployment , 
(2) reduce crime rate,
(3)improve our standard of living.

#NB all this at ceteris, the idea also improve relations between the two countries involved. My OPINION.

04/03/24, 4:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Jonathan, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

06/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 388 8648: Sorry for late response have been busy untill now
06/03/24, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @263773888648 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
06/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 388 8648: No they don't know
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
06/03/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 388 8648: No
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know why?
06/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 388 8648: we can't afford that kind of money si
06/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 388 8648: As you know Zimbabwe
06/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 388 8648: Workers are not paid enough money and Zimbabwean currency doesn't buy anything because of the rate
06/03/24, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, but considering that you have applied for the scholarship for your higher education, I believe your parents must have done some financial preparation beforehand for your higher education?
06/03/24, 5:36 pm - +263 77 388 8648: Yes
06/03/24, 7:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

11/03/24, 8:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
12/03/24, 8:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263773888648 @263772388902 @263773899331 , Hope you are doing well.

12/03/24, 8:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
12/03/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 388 8648: Hello
12/03/24, 8:47 pm - +263 77 388 8648: I have been having network problem here,I am very sorry about failure to respond
