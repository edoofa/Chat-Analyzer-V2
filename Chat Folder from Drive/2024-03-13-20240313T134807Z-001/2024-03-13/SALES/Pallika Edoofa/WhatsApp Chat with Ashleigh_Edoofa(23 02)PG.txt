This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

06/03/24, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Ms. Tendai, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
06/03/24, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!

*BDesign Graphic Design*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
07/03/24, 3:48 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I have an idea thanks
07/03/24, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
07/03/24, 3:52 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes you may explain the course further
07/03/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
07/03/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor of Design [B.Des]* in Communication Design is a 4-year full time undergraduate course. The programme is divided into 8 semesters of six months each.

Graphic Design is a specialised branch of communication design, and candidates wishing to specialise in this need to start out with a degree in communication design, which would allow them to specialise in graphic design after second year.
The course is best suited for those who are interested in seeking a career in anything from marketing companies to government agencies.

Having a bachelors in communication design opens the gateway to being a graphic artist, merchandiser, creative director or website designer. One may work in industries including media, public relations, communications, education and business.

Projects in this line of work include customized web-design for various merchandisers, creating advertisements for small businesses, developing magazine layouts or graphic designing for video games among other things. Some standard skills required for the aforementioned careers include creativity, knowledge of design techniques, familiarity with various multimedia and other relevant technical skills. Any design course fundamentally caters to those creatively inclined and left-brain oriented, equipping them with the necessary skills to make a career out of essentially thinking outside the box.

*What is it about?*

The program has been designed to offer the eligible students a course that concentrates on the conceptualisation, ‘design’, and execution of an idea. It can range from an advertisement to a movie, anything at all which needs to be graphically designed, the technology and software’s associated with it. The study of the course includes subjects like typography, colour theory, and layout theory. A B.Des degree in Graphic introduces a student to the industry of graphic design, understanding its history and its future, and to the technology and equipment required to design something. It focuses on the principles of design such as balance, contrast, movement and rhythm, etc., on typography, creating images for web and print, editing images, and ultimately leadership skills required to lead a team with your idea in this industry.  

This line of design is growing relevance in contemporary times. Everything today from education to markets of all types have now gained either a secondary digital presence, or operate solely in the digital space. Not only has digitization allowed producers to find wider markets but also allowed niche producers to find consumers that fit their specific demographic. Digitisation has eliminated, in various cases, costs associated with commute and thus made web-designing and digital branding critical to commerce today. Thus graduates in graphic design definitely are fit for the current ‘virtual market’ age. In fact, they have become quite indispensable in almost all industries today.

To sustain in this field one must be equipped with exceptional analytical skills and consumer insight to cater designs to consumer sensibility as well as the client’s brand image. Their artistic ability must undoubtedly be of a high grade and they should have the computer skills to translate their art into a graphic design, with a strong sense of creativity. They must be able communicators so they can understand the client’s needs and communicate his or her vision, as well as be good at time management since in this field an employee is required to work on multiple projects at the same time.

*Career Prospects*

Bachelors of Design in Communication Design graduates may have job opportunities both in the private and the government sector due to changing nature of the economy in this digital age. Today everything is seen through a web interface, exists solely on a web interface, or expands through a web interface. Furthermore, advertising campaigns and branding have become exceedingly digitized and much more intricate in design. Thus graduates in this course have a plethora of job opportunities on offer. Manufacturing units, marketing agencies, fashion media, boutiques, hotels, etc. are examples of the various private sector enterprises that hire graphic design graduates.
Job profiles for both these sectors includes graphic designers that are concerned with the conceptualization, sketching, and creation of designs keeping in mind the needs of the clients and consumer susceptibility. Similarly Web designers are occupied with the creation of websites, and more specialized job profiles in this field include interaction designers, communications designers, service designers, and etc.  

The market today is perfect for a graphic design graduate considering their need across multiple industries. Most business and enterprises today, as well as government agencies require designers in order to make them accessible in this age of marketing and digitization.

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
08/03/24, 12:28 pm - +27 63 427 2451: India has a diverse education system that includes both public and private schools and universities. The education system in India is overseen by the Ministry of Education, and it is divided into different levels, including primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. India has a large number of universities and colleges offering various courses in different fields, including engineering, medicine, humanities, and social sciences. Additionally, Indian education culture emphasizes the importance of rote learning, memorization, and academic excellence.
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ashleigh, India indeed boasts a diverse education system overseen by the Ministry of Education, encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Its numerous universities and colleges offer a wide array of courses spanning engineering, medicine, humanities, and social sciences. Notably, India's education culture emphasizes rote learning, memorization, and academic prowess.
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/03/24, 12:37 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I might not be familiar but I can definitely help with that. To estimate the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship, I can consider factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, and other related costs. Tuition fees for international students can vary widely depending on the country and specific institution. Additionally, living expenses such as accommodation, food, transportation, and other personal costs should also be taken into account. It's important to research specific universities and their respective cost estimates to obtain a more accurate picture of the total expenses involved.
08/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:04 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes I believe so
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse the delay as I was having my lunch.
08/03/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/03/24, 3:03 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I don't think I know, please explain further
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
09/03/24, 10:41 am - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
09/03/24, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well
09/03/24, 11:22 am - +27 63 427 2451: We are, hope you are too.
09/03/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Indeed, I am!
09/03/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 11:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
09/03/24, 11:30 am - +27 63 427 2451: I fully understand the concept now, thank you very much.
09/03/24, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
09/03/24, 12:21 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Number 2
09/03/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures

09/03/24, 12:39 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I had discussed this with my parents prior
09/03/24, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, you will get a chance to discuss the same with your parents
09/03/24, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: at the end of the session!
09/03/24, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad? <This message was edited>
09/03/24, 7:37 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Ohk thanks



They were a bit skeptical at first as it will be my first time traveling alone, if I'm accepted, bu they are now comfortable with it. They support the decision
09/03/24, 8:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great to hear! Having the support of your loved ones can make all the difference when embarking on new adventures. Traveling alone for the first time can be both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, but it's also an incredible opportunity for personal growth and discovery.
09/03/24, 8:20 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes indeed!
09/03/24, 8:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
09/03/24, 8:25 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Please explain further about the other requirements
09/03/24, 8:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, please
09/03/24, 8:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, you see, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/03/24, 8:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 8:28 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes please
09/03/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
09/03/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
09/03/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
09/03/24, 8:36 pm - +27 63 427 2451: And that's if I'm eligible? So I have to wait to be accepted first? <This message was edited>
09/03/24, 8:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, After we end our today's session, your further process will take place as your eligibility check test and the interview.
09/03/24, 8:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 8:41 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Till 3 <This message was edited>
09/03/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
09/03/24, 8:54 pm - +27 73 941 4995: As parent, when my daughter decides to study abroad, I experience a mix of emotions.On one hand, I would feel proud and excited for her to embark on this new adventure and explore different cultures and perspectives.l also recognize the opportunities that studying abroad can offer her in terms of personal growth, independent, and academic development.
I also feel a sense of worry and concern for her well being.Being away from home and living in a foreign country can bring about challenges and uncertainties.i naturally be concerned about her safety, health and ability to adapt to a new environment
At the same time,I feel a sense of longing and missing her presence.It would be significant change to have her physically distant, and I miss the day to day interaction, conversation and shared experiences that we have as a family

Overall as parent my emotions would range from excitement, pride, worry, concern and a sense of missing her. I Support her decision and trust in her ability to navigate this new chapter in her life when ever she needs guidance and support from afar
09/03/24, 8:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Tendai, Your feelings as a parent are completely understandable and natural. It's normal to experience a mix of emotions when your child decides to study abroad. Your support and trust in her abilities will undoubtedly provide her with the strength and confidence to navigate this new chapter in her life. Keep communication open and know that your love and support will be felt across the distance.
09/03/24, 8:55 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes maam
09/03/24, 8:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/03/24, 8:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
09/03/24, 9:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected?
09/03/24, 9:06 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
11/03/24, 9:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I hope that you are doing well and hope that you had a great weekend,

11/03/24, 10:49 am - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
11/03/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ashleigh, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*

11/03/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, have a great day
12/03/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Ashleigh, and Dear Parents,

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
12/03/24, 10:51 am - +27 63 427 2451: Yes
12/03/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ashleigh,
I hope you are doing well
12/03/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
12/03/24, 11:09 am - +27 63 427 2451: Yes I did, and they understood it
12/03/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
12/03/24, 2:06 pm - +27 63 427 2451: They were a bit skeptical at first as it will be my first time traveling alone, if I'm accepted, bu they are now comfortable with it. They support the decision
12/03/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand!
12/03/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

12/03/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
12/03/24, 3:33 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Certainly. My family's thoughts and opinions regarding the financial aspects of enrollment fees and cost of education are as follows:

They believe that education is a valuable investment for me future, but at the same time, they are concerned about the rising cost of education. They would like to ensure that they are getting the best value for their money, and that the education I'll receive will prepare me for a successful career.

They are also interested in exploring financial aid options, such as scholarships, grants, and loans. They understand that these options can be competitive, but they are willing to put in the effort to research and apply for me.

Overall, my family is committed to providing me with a quality education, but they are also conscious of the financial implications and want to make informed decisions.
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the concerns, but did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
12/03/24, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
12/03/24, 3:47 pm - +27 63 427 2451: I'm in South Africa, but I'll do so right away
12/03/24, 3:47 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes I am!
12/03/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this!
12/03/24, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career
12/03/24, 3:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ashleigh, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/03/24, 6:19 pm - +27 63 427 2451: Yes I am
12/03/24, 9:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address these
