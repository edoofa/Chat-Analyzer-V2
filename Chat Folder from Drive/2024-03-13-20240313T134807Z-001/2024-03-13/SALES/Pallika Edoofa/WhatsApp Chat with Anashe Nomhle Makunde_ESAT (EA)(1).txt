I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Piiyush, The head of Counseling, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application name for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
12/03/24, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
12/03/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 405 9910: Thank you. Greetings to you all
12/03/24, 12:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session!
12/03/24, 12:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Okay so Anashe, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/03/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 669 9710: I do
12/03/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright so Anashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
