11/03/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Eugene and, mr. Charles,
I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Piiyush, The head of Counseling, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application name for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
11/03/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 975 4249: good day, how are you, i am available.
11/03/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Okay so Lesley, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session!
11/03/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
