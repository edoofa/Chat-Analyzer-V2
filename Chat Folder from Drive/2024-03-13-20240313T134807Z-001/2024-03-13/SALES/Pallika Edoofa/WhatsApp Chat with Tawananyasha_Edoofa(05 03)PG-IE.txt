05/03/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*

06/03/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/03/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd.

06/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 828 5002: Oky noted with thanks.. So for one to have a fully funded scholarship, what are the requirements.
06/03/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship

06/03/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Please!

Shall we continue?
12/03/24, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Tawananyasha, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
