Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
08/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 449 2923: I'm a parent of seven children, 5 girls and 3 boys.I have served in many companies such as Nyaradzo,a funeral service in Zimbabwe a social worker in child protection and  currently I'm at a mission school called Usher high School serving as a security guard.I wrote my  exams in   1979 and acquired 2b's and 4 C's and that's when I went on to do social work.Out of all my children Mthulisi is the first one to finish Advanced level and I'm looking forward for him to acquire education so that he can take care of the family. I will be retiring next year in June and I don't think I will be able to finance him to proceed with his education so I had to push him to search for a scholarship
08/03/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to know more about you, Mr. Emmanuel, I am glad that you have a good vision for the career of your child and I believe it will come true if he is found eligible for the program

08/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 449 2923: Mthulisi sat for his Ordinary level in 2021 and proceeded to Advanced level in 2022-2023 doing Family and Religious Studies, History and Ndebele.He has always liked anything that has to do with media and when I asked him he had to say that loud that I want to do media studies .He spends much time playing music and during weekends he teaches some of his friends music, playing drums, keyboard,brass band and many more from which they appointed him the bandmaster.He is  passionate about everything he does at one point I almost advised him to be a teacher because he would be patient  person in teaching his friends.He has 3 elder sisters,2 young sisters and 2 twin little brothers.He sat for his O level and A level at Usher High school.I have been supporting him he paying $27 per term.Usher high is a girls high but I just had to send him there despite being a boy living with him in the cottage so that it wouldn't strain me financially because the his other two sisters are also at school and I need to take care of three households and my salary would not allow that.He finished his A level last year2023.He lives in Matebeleland.He is a person who can lead others because he was the headboy last year at Usher high School and a leader in some other church brigades.what I know is he is very short temperd but he will never show that out

11/03/24, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mr. Emmanuel, I would like to know that managing your other children school expenses, will you be able to manage Mthulsi's higher education abroad too?
11/03/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 449 2923: I alone I don't think so
11/03/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 449 2923: I will have to seek for help
11/03/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand Mr. Emmanuel, But did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
11/03/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
11/03/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
11/03/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 449 2923: Yes that's true
11/03/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 449 2923: Very much looking forward
11/03/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
11/03/24, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, I hope that you will manage the remaining expenses and the higher amount will be managed by Mthulisi.
11/03/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 449 2923: Ok
11/03/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 449 2923: So probably how much can it cost per annum talking about tuition fees
11/03/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding the same further!
11/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 449 2923: Ok
11/03/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Based on my evaluation, considering Mthulisi's subjects, interests, and passion, he is eligible to pursue


*Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)*

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/03/24, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 449 2923: Yeah that's a massive decrease but I'm afraid I've to hustle more because I'm retiring next year
11/03/24, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
11/03/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 01:10 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

11/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 449 2923: No problem
11/03/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for waiting,

Are you ready to continue?
11/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Yes Ma Pallika
11/03/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share this!
11/03/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/03/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/03/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
11/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 994 3409: I think I will have to do that
11/03/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 994 3409: So is it possible that one can learn on credit
11/03/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
11/03/24, 2:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Ok now I get it
11/03/24, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
11/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Not just one but everything is significant
11/03/24, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

11/03/24, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/03/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 994 3409: I see
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
11/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 994 3409: My father
11/03/24, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/03/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 994 3409: It's a dream come true because it has been their wish for me to study abroad
11/03/24, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
11/03/24, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
11/03/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 994 3409: When should I submit these
11/03/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Our Admissions Team will be guiding you for the same
11/03/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/03/24, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Yes when is it paid
11/03/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you! <This message was edited>
11/03/24, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
11/03/24, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
11/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Understandable
11/03/24, 3:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 994 3409: Are we not going to stage 2
11/03/24, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Mthulisi, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
11/03/24, 7:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 994 3409: Morning Ms Pallika
12/03/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 994 3409: May you please excuse me today for the session I need to visit my school today and get a recommendation letter
12/03/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 994 3409: Yes today I had planned to go my former school to get a recommendation letter.will it be problem if could excuse me today
12/03/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Oh I see, But your session will end in 5 minutes and after that your application will be forwarded to Stage 2
12/03/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 994 3409: Ok then let's do it
12/03/24, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
12/03/24, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
12/03/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 994 3409: Yes sir

12/03/24, 10:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mthulisi, we have come to the end of your counselling session.
