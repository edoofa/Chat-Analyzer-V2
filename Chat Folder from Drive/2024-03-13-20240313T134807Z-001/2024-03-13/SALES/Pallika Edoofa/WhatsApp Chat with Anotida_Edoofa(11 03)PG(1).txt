12/03/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Anotida, As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

How u pay half of the fees and also the fact that having an opportunity to learn abroad will make me get to know new things because of new environment and also socialize with new people having the same goes.
2.She told me that u pay half of the fees right. So l will have to take care of traveling costs. So l see it as a good thing. Um not so sure about shelter?
12/03/24, 10:36 am - +254 790 302252: My name is Forward Muchetu and I am a biological brother to Anotida Muchetu.

I am a holder of two bachelor degrees;Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Science in International Business Management.

What motivates me to support Anotida is the fact that education is paramount for skill development and we often refer education as a key to success.I believe that if Anotida gets an opportunity to study ,it will transform  his life and largely the community that he hails from. 

Thanks!

So my parents  joined this other group where they keep money as a group and the group consists of more than 5 to 6 people. So they put USD$10 every Friday.
