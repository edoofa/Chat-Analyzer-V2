28/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group.

28/02/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

28/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 73 347 1110: Ok thank you for your time I am looking forward for your response
28/02/24, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this!
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 73 347 1110: Ok thank you
28/02/24, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
28/02/24, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinashe, I would like to know what specific plans and preparations you and your parents have made for your tertiary education abroad?
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - +263 73 347 1110: At this particular moment we haven't made much as l have mentioned that I am still doing my A level studies and that is why  applied to Edoofa for help and way forward
28/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Tinashe!
28/02/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
28/02/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moreover, do you feel your family can be prepared for your higher education abroad just within a few months after your A level results?
28/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 73 347 1110: Yes they will be prepared
28/02/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

I have aslo understand that it has been entrusted with a total of $10 million from the Education fund . That is why they interview each of the student to so that they can offer to deserving student. Edoofa has recommended lndia because in India they use English as the intermidiate language unlike as it done in other countries.

11/03/24, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinashe, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
