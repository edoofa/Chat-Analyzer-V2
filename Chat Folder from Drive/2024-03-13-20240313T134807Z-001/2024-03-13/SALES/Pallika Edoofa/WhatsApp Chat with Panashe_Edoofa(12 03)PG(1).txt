This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.* <This message was edited>

12/03/24, 4:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, Moving forward, I would like to know that if you are interested in the medical field so why haven't you pursued Biology in your A level?
12/03/24, 5:10 pm - +263 78 083 0955: My A-level choices were driven by a desire to diversify my skills. While I didn't choose Biology, I selected subjects that offer a strong foundation for critical thinking, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary approaches, which are valuable in the medical field.This approach allows me to approach healthcare from multiple perspectives.
12/03/24, 5:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
12/03/24, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*

*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
