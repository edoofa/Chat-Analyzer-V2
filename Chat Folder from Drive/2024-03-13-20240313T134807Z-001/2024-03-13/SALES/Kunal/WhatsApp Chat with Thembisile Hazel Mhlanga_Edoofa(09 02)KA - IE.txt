*The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/02/24, 11:36 am - Kunal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than *200 schools in Zimbabwe*. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others*. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few *St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than *2500 Zimbabweans* who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

10/02/24, 11:42 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
*Mrs Tshuma* ,I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
10/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 742 7026: So for her to enter or to be accepted  she needs how many points
10/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 742 7026: Am 30 years of age ...am unemployed  my highest education is form 2 because  I dd not  get a chance to finish my grades so tts wats motivated me a lot tt my child to finish her education because she seems to be a dedicated  child and she knows wats she wants and I want  the best for her
10/02/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about yourself
 I am glad that you have a good vision for the career of your child and I believe it will come true if your child is found eligible for the program
10/02/24, 11:50 am - Kunal: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship.
