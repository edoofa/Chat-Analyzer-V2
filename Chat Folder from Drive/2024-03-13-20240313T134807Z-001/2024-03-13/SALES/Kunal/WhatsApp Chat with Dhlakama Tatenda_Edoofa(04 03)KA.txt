How are you doing?

I am expecting to hear from you
09/03/24, 10:02 am - Kunal: Greetings to you

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Please Note by *Tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
09/03/24, 8:27 pm - +263 78 107 3758: l am sorry for not responding to you soon, somehow my parents managed save some money for me to study at a local university here in Zimbabwe.
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How was your weekend?
11/03/24, 9:40 am - Kunal: I understand
As per your understanding, may I know what is the total cost included while studying in a local university?
11/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 107 3758: Morning how are you sir.
11/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 107 3758: The total cost for a year is US$2,800
11/03/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
11/03/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: Let me give you a clear picture
11/03/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand the living and cost of education in Zimbabwe, 

1. UZ's fee for 2024 intake is $650-$750 a semester, meaning $1300-$1500 a year for tuition.
2. Cost of accommodation is around $80-$100 a month, meaning $1000-$1200 a year.
3. Cost of food, even if you consider a simple meal of sadza and chicken curry that costs $1, so $1 a meal and 3 meals a day that is $3 a day, which means almost $1200 a year.
4. Miscellaneous expenses such as travel, internet easily cost $40-$50 a month meaning $600 a year.

All in all cost of studying at locally in Zimbabwe is be around $4000-$4800 a year!
11/03/24, 11:18 am - Kunal: Now through the Edoofa program the cost is much lower and there are specific courses where a child can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship. 
Apart from this, we have the Earn While You Learn program where students can self-finance and reduce the cost of education even more affordable based on their efforts and efficiency
11/03/24, 1:11 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:15 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
