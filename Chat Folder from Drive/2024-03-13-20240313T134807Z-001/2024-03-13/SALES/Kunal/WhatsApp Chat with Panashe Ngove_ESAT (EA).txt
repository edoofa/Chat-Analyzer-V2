02/03/24, 1:41 pm - Kunal: May I know how are you related to Mr Ngove?
02/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 108 0244: He is my brother
02/03/24, 1:46 pm - +27 68 594 3877: Hi good day, I'm sorry I wanted to know about how much will be the 10% which a student needs to pay as part of school fees. Thank you
02/03/24, 1:47 pm - Kunal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 1:51 pm - +27 68 594 3877: I'm referring to a specific student Panashe Ngove, on what percentage is he so that we can be aware of how much will need to be paid annually
02/03/24, 1:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 9:29 am - +263 77 108 0244: 9:30 is right. We can proceed with the session by that time if possible.
04/03/24, 10:20 am - Kunal: Good morning everyone
How are you doing?
04/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 108 0244: I am doing well and you sir
04/03/24, 10:23 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
04/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 108 0244: You are welcome
04/03/24, 10:24 am - Kunal: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
04/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 108 0244: So, what should we do firstly.
04/03/24, 10:54 am - Kunal: Okay so Panashe, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 108 0244: Yes sir, l have A level and other previous results. I also have 62/100 marks of the previous ESAT exam
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Kunal: Alright so Panashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/03/24, 11:19 am - +27 68 594 3877: Thank you so much, this is really understandable and very clear, we will start with the enrollment pavements as soon as possible
04/03/24, 11:20 am - Kunal: I am glad to know that

04/03/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 108 0244: To begin with, my name is Panashe Ngove.l am the citizen of Zimbabwe. I am the fourth born of Mr and Mrs Ngove. I was born in a polygamous family and our home is located in remote areas in Chipinge District, in Manicaland province. I  began my academic life at Mabee Primary School under the sponsorship of BEAM. I passed my primary level and continue with education at Mabee Secondary School under community support. Fortunately, I passed my O level and decided to go with my education. My Headmaster, Mr Muhlahlayazi of Mabee Secondary School discussed with Mr Anthony of Mutandahwe High School about my financial issue and agreed that l was going to do some duties on School project for my A level finances. In 2022, l began my A level at Mutandahwe High School upto 2023 and passed with 14 points where I got the following results:
COMPUTER SCIENCE A
PURE MATHEMATICS B
ECONOMICS A
. During my academic life at A level, l was the headboy of the school. At the same time, the Junior Member of Parliament of Chipinge South constituent and l was excited to archive my goals in controlling issues like drug abuse and disobedience of learners. I also moved around different communities, looking for children who dropped out of school due to lack of finances and directed  them to the school committee so, that can get help through sponsorships like BEAM. My father is a disabled, unemployed man and mother is a subsistence farmer together with other wives just to earn a living
04/03/24, 12:08 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about yourself and your family honestly, Panshe

04/03/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Software Engineering why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
04/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 108 0244: There was no physical science at Mutandahwe High School, even chemistry and biology wasn't there.
04/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 108 0244: We were very few. It was a small class of A level students during our time and there was no teachers of those subjects
04/03/24, 2:31 pm - Kunal: I understand
Since you are not having Physics, you are not eligible for the field of Engineering
At the same time based on your previous results and evaluation of ESAT percentile, accessing your strengths and weaknesses I foresee you doing a Degree in *Bachelor of Computer Application* So now shall I brief you about *COURSE*?
04/03/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Yes sir, you can give a brief description .
04/03/24, 2:37 pm - Kunal: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course.

04/03/24, 3:02 pm - Kunal: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*

04/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 108 0244: So what will be the annual fee after the cholarship percentage
04/03/24, 3:10 pm - +27 68 594 3877: Thank you so much for guiding him out, the job profile still good
04/03/24, 3:30 pm - Kunal: In simple words NAME what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/03/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 108 0244: So what will be the annual payment after the percentage?
04/03/24, 3:48 pm - Kunal: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
04/03/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 108 0244: It's okay sir l understand
04/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 108 0244: So what to do next
04/03/24, 4:15 pm - Kunal: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
04/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Yes, it shows that we are talking about the real things.
04/03/24, 4:28 pm - Kunal: Alright Panashe, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/03/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Yes, I remember and discussed with them. So, what will be the way forward.
04/03/24, 5:07 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Yes I am ready
04/03/24, 5:28 pm - Kunal: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*

04/03/24, 5:29 pm - +263 77 108 0244: I understand sir
04/03/24, 5:32 pm - Kunal: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 5:32 pm - Kunal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
04/03/24, 5:32 pm - Kunal: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.
04/03/24, 5:33 pm - Kunal: Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
04/03/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Thanks sir, l really appreciate your offer
04/03/24, 5:35 pm - Kunal: However Panashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 5:35 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Thanks for that. So this means l am now supposed to pay 300?
04/03/24, 5:37 pm - Kunal: That is right
04/03/24, 5:37 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
04/03/24, 5:38 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Yaa l can see that's an affordable payment plan sir
04/03/24, 5:39 pm - Kunal: Glad to hear that
Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/03/24, 5:40 pm - +263 77 108 0244: I am not familiar with that, you can give a brief
04/03/24, 5:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:41 pm - Kunal: Alright Panashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 5:41 pm - Kunal: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 5:42 pm - +263 77 108 0244: This message was deleted
04/03/24, 5:43 pm - +263 77 108 0244: I understand the steps and we are at step 1
04/03/24, 5:43 pm - Kunal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 5:43 pm - Kunal: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 5:44 pm - Kunal: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 5:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:46 pm - +263 77 108 0244: That's good sir. So for now, when do l am expected to pay the enrollment fee.
04/03/24, 5:49 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee comes into play after you have cleared the next stage which is the eligibility check stage
Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
04/03/24, 5:49 pm - Kunal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/03/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 108 0244: It's okay sir. I am going to discuss with them. So, after the discussion what would l do.
04/03/24, 5:53 pm - +263 77 108 0244: I understand the picture and l can see that I am now going to step 2
04/03/24, 6:06 pm - +263 77 108 0244: So, when am I going to proceed to the step 2 ?
04/03/24, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Also, I am sharing some pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program

05/03/24, 10:06 am - Kunal: Please address this
05/03/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 108 0244: After the discussion with my family we have realised that Edoofa is so helpful and affordable for my academic life. My family would be happy for me if I become a selected student in Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I am always dreaming of studying abroad through this helpful scholarship.
We can see that edoofa is affordable especially after looking at the fees of  universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from 650 to $750 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2300 per year. So this shows edoofa is so helpful and affordable. At the same time it makes it easier to be employed after completing the course in India.
They were also happy about the carrier that you have guided me to. They are saying it is good and going to be helpful. They really appreciated your effort.
They also said they will help me with some finances if l found eligible and they will pay according to the given affordable payment plan
05/03/24, 10:25 am - Kunal: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
05/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 108 0244: Let's hear from my brother maybe he wants to ask something bt others understood very well and they have nothing to ask maybe as time goes.
05/03/24, 10:34 am - +27 68 594 3877: For now I don't have any questions as he explained we really discussed everything and understood all the processes needs be gone through.
05/03/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 108 0244: They don't have questions sir.

09/03/24, 12:38 pm - Kunal: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself.

09/03/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Thank you sir. So, does it means it will add up to 344 as we subtract offered $50 for my enrollment fee?

09/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 108 0244: So you have discussed with him right
09/03/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 108 0244: Exactly, this is Mr Maposa.
09/03/24, 1:53 pm - Kunal: That is right, Panashe
11/03/24, 9:08 am - Kunal: Good morning, Panashe

11/03/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 108 0244: I am so much better sir and how are you doing that side?
11/03/24, 9:51 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
11/03/24, 9:51 am - Kunal: May I know if you are clear with the process?
11/03/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 108 0244: Not yet sir but I am going to see Mr Maposa for the enrollment fee payment before 15th of this month
11/03/24, 10:30 am - Kunal: That is fine, Panashe
May I know why do you wish to meet Mr Maposa?
11/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 108 0244: To handle him cash for that enrollment payment since you said l can pay through his account
11/03/24, 10:32 am - Kunal: Alright Panashe
If you wish you to pay through his account, you can go to any FBC bank near and you can pay in his account with the cash you are having
11/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 108 0244: It's okay sir. We will see what to do before 15th
11/03/24, 10:36 am - +27 68 594 3877: Good morning, i think its  okay for Panashe to go pay cash at Mr Maposa as Panashe will be on his way to Chipinge so he will pass and pay.
11/03/24, 10:43 am - Kunal: I understand the same

Based on your conversation with Mr. Maposa, who mentioned that they will not be able to accept cash, I would advise you, as your counselor, to deposit the enrollment fee into his FBC account and take the receipt with you when you are going to meet them
11/03/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 108 0244: It's okay sir. So, this means we can deposit the enrollment fee in his account and handle him a copy of the receipt of payment?
11/03/24, 10:49 am - Kunal: That is right, Panashe
12/03/24, 10:05 am - Kunal: *Get ready to witness the heartwarming testimonials of our proud Edoofians!* They're glad to share their remarkable journey, filled with excitement, joy, invaluable learnings, and unforgettable experiences in India.
