11/03/24, 9:38 am - Kunal: Greetings to you

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Please Note by *Tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
12/03/24, 8:25 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all
I hope you are doing well

We have been eagerly anticipating your response in this group, and unfortunately, due to your lack of response, we are regrettably closing your application formally. You are welcome to re-apply when you are ready to pursue higher education in India.

In the meantime, if you happen to encounter friends or family members interested in studying abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them for their consideration. If they express interest in applying for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, feel free to share my contact information with them. They can then fill out the application form and share it with me directly. 

Stay blessed
