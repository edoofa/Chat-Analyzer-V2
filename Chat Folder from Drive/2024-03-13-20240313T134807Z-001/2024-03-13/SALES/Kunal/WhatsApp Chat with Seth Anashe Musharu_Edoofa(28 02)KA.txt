Shall I explain the course in depth?
11/03/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 500 5700: You explained before. He got informatics program at Nust so he prefares informatics
11/03/24, 11:15 am - Kunal: Let me tell you, earlier I explained *Bachelor of Computer Application* for you not Bsc Computer Science
11/03/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: Have you considered the rate of employability for your child after completing a degree at a local university?
11/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 500 5700: Will ask him if he would prefer BSc Computer Science
11/03/24, 12:07 pm - Kunal: That is fine
Do you wish me to explain the course?
11/03/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 346 9586: Yes
11/03/24, 12:34 pm - Kunal: *B.Sc.

11/03/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
11/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 346 9586: It's alright we may proceed
11/03/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: Have you gone through this course?
11/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 346 9586: Yes l dd
11/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 346 9586: Think it's much better than computer applications, which is much centered on basic IT
11/03/24, 3:42 pm - Kunal: That is amazing, 
*Moving forawrd by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
11/03/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 346 9586: Have no idea mayb if you can highlight on that
11/03/24, 3:50 pm - Kunal: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/03/24, 3:50 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 346 9586: OK quite interesting
11/03/24, 4:12 pm - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
12/03/24, 8:23 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
I am expecting to hear from you
12/03/24, 6:03 pm - Kunal: *Let us connect at 9:30 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session

Stay Blessed!
