12/03/24, 8:21 am - +27 79 868 2243: Had a very busy day yesterday couldn't manage to keep my promise due to exhaustion
12/03/24, 8:38 am - +27 79 868 2243: Anyhow on a lighter note,i haven't spent a lot of time with my kids as am hustling in South Africa and my kids are in Zimbabwe
Siphesihle is a well reserved person who takes education serious
The corona pandemic did derail her progress a bit
The only weakness I can see on her is being short tempered when she sees that she's been short changed
She did her Ordinary level and came out with good results,we were aiming to take her to a good school for her Advanced level but due to financial constraints we couldn't manage
She has represented her school and province in lots of educational trips eg she came tops last year in the provincial competition organized by the president of the country,she had the privilege of meeting and lunching with the president
Presently she's staying with her aunt where she is attending her Advanced level,which she is going to write this year
Me and her mum are the one's helping her with her educational needs
Due to the financial difficulty she saw on her parents,i think thats the major reasons she needs this scholarship as she feels she wants more about her education
12/03/24, 9:51 am - Kunal: Good morning
I hope you are doing fine

Shall we proceed with the session?
12/03/24, 9:55 am - +27 79 868 2243: Morning to you too

12/03/24, 10:00 am - Kunal: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
12/03/24, 10:07 am - +27 79 868 2243: To be honest with you,my finances were eroded last year because I spent 3/4 of the year not working,this was due to ill health
So far am in debt,but this industry am in(transport)is very lucrative
12/03/24, 10:11 am - Kunal: I understand your situation, Mr Mfiselwa

As you're aware, the Edoofa Scholarship Program provides scholarships ranging from 50% to 100% on tuition fees. However, there are additional costs for living expenses and transportation that must be covered by the student's family. If you are deemed eligible for the program, are you able to manage these remaining expenses?
12/03/24, 10:43 am - +27 79 868 2243: We as parents will definitely go the extra mile to cover some of the expensis
Maybe in shorts,u can briefly highlight us the approximations of some of the expensis as this is the first time we get this opportunities for our kids
12/03/24, 10:51 am - Kunal: I would like to provide you with an informative FAQ document about the Edoofa program. I encourage you to carefully review the details, and after discussing it with your family, kindly share your thoughts and any questions you may have.
