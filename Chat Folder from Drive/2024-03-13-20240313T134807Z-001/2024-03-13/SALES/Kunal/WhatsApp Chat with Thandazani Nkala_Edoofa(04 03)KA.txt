I hope you're all doing well. My sincere apologies for the delay; unfortunately, I wasn't feeling well.

Are we ready to proceed?
07/03/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 103 8294: Okay okay good morning
07/03/24, 12:02 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you

07/03/24, 12:07 pm - Kunal: Good to know that
07/03/24, 12:09 pm - Kunal: Since you are concerned about these aspects, have you researched about the cost involved in the same?
07/03/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 103 8294: I haven't but actually i had no one to cover them... May you help me with the estimate cost..
07/03/24, 12:51 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
07/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 103 8294: Okay i really get you..
07/03/24, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Do you have any questions?

12/03/24, 8:24 am - Kunal: Greetings to you

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Please Note by *Tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
