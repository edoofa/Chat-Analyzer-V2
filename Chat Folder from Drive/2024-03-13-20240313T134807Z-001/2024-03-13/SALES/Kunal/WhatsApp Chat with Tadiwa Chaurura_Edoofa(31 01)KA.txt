31/01/24, 6:26 pm - Kunal: Good evening
Shall we proceed?
31/01/24, 6:26 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
31/01/24, 6:26 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Yes we can proceed
31/01/24, 6:28 pm - Kunal: You can address this
31/01/24, 6:42 pm - +263 77 661 4382: I know of some who pay between 3,500EUR - 12,000EURO or more  per study programme per year
31/01/24, 6:42 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 6:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 6:42 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 6:46 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Waaal this is very affordable i can't wait to get such an opportunity to study abroad at such low affordable cost
31/01/24, 6:47 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 6:47 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:

If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
31/01/24, 7:03 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 7:11 pm - +263 77 661 4382: This is fantastic ,lm inspired by Miriam ,l want to aim higher,
31/01/24, 7:31 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
31/01/24, 7:59 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Earning while you Learn is the most important to me because it helps reduce cost of studying to my family while it exposes me to real working experience getting me ready to tackle the world with all the knowledge from my Edoofa studies.
31/01/24, 8:00 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

31/01/24, 8:00 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 77 661 4382: My brother fully pays for my needs and he has committed that until I am able to be independent on my needs. He is on this group
31/01/24, 8:04 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 8:07 pm - +263 77 661 4382: For my family it will be a dream come true because they always wanted me to be exposed to the world, getting quality skills from good institutions abroad especially India which is offering affordable opportunities to study abroad whilst getting the best exposure and experience with diversity
31/01/24, 8:10 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 8:10 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 8:29 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
31/01/24, 8:35 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Sorry l was distracted by power cut, May you give me just 5 minutes then we proceed,
31/01/24, 8:36 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Tadiwa
31/01/24, 8:36 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 8:37 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 8:38 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Yes
👇🏻
4. Minimum qualifications required 

5. Upfront admission and tuition fees  

6. Visa feasibility check and traveling documents availability required at the eliminatory stages/beginning of the interviews to cement eligibility of applicants
31/01/24, 8:41 pm - Kunal: Indeed Tadiwa
31/01/24, 8:41 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
31/01/24, 8:44 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Yes you can inform me
31/01/24, 8:44 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
31/01/24, 8:44 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
31/01/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Fantastic!Thank you so much
31/01/24, 8:47 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 661 4382: I think stage 2
31/01/24, 8:55 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
31/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Yes please thank you
31/01/24, 8:57 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
31/01/24, 8:57 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
31/01/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Very clear now
31/01/24, 9:01 pm - Kunal: Alright Tadiwa
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
31/01/24, 9:02 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

31/01/24, 9:05 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Thank you so much
31/01/24, 9:14 pm - +263 77 661 4382: That is spot-on and crystal clearly elaborated. Thank you Sir Kunal.
01/02/24, 12:08 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
01/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Good morning Sir Kunal
Yes we can proceed, thank you
01/02/24, 12:13 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
01/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Greetings sir. Thank you for going through with Tadiwa on 1st stage successfully we appreciate so much. We are ready for the eligibility check stage
01/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 293 1063: I m Tadiwa's brother and guardian Enock
01/02/24, 12:17 pm - Kunal: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 293 1063: This is a very good programme especially for students our country most of which can't afford the cost of international universities. As family we also liked the Earn While You Learn scheme which further reduces the cost of studying and also giving an opportunity for the students to engage on extracurricular activities preparing them for the world
01/02/24, 12:26 pm - Kunal: I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform Tadiwa's career!
Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 293 1063: The few questions I have are just ordinary questions relating to authenticity of the Scholarship Program because there are other bogus platforms out there who sometimes appear to assist while they do human trafficking and then sometimes victims end up being abused in some countries some being discriminated because of culture and race especially those from African countries. Do you have strong policies which protect students against these potential challenges?
01/02/24, 12:31 pm - Kunal: Being a gaurdian, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

01/02/24, 12:36 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that
May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Thank you. Tadiwa explained to me and I also went through the 1st stage and picked that the enrollment fees and eventually the cost of education becomes very reasonably affordable we are happy with your Earn While You Learn program as it further makes the cost reduced as the students earns more scholarship credits. I was inspired by some students' certificates showing monthly credits. That's excellent!
01/02/24, 12:45 pm - Kunal: I appreciate your willingness to invest in Tadiwa's career

05/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 293 1063: We are very excited by this good news. Once again thank you very much sir
05/02/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: You are most welcome, we are really glad that Tadiwa qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We look forward to your Brother as a proud Edoofian fulfilling his career goals through this opportunity.

Have you gone through the Acceptance Letter?
05/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Yes I have gone through it and I will settle the the enrollment fee this week
05/02/24, 12:15 pm - Kunal: Thank you for informing
Do you have any questions regarding the Acceptance letter?
05/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 661 4382: Thank you so much Sir Kunal.lm really excited.I thank you for all the effort.My family and l appreciate your effort.Once again thank you.
05/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Not as of now. I understood I can pay the fee through Mr Charles Jerera here in Zimbabwe. I will contact him today I was talking to him about Edoofa last week and I will advise him of this achievement. I also understand after enrollment fee Tadiwa will be given list of Universities to pick from is that so?
05/02/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: We are confident that this opportunity will play a pivotal role in propelling you towards the achievement of your career goals. Congratulations!
05/02/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: That is Alright
Do you want me to explain the mode of paying the enrollment fee in depth?
05/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 293 1063: I will appreciate that so much
05/02/24, 12:24 pm - Kunal: Alright, you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
05/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Mode number 2 is most convenient for me
05/02/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student range between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
05/02/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
05/02/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

05/02/24, 12:54 pm - Kunal: That is absolutely fine
Do you have any other questions for me?
05/02/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Not at the moment sir if any I will contact you. Thank you so much sir
05/02/24, 2:24 pm - Kunal: *Get ready to witness the heartwarming testimonials of our proud Edoofians!* They're glad to share their remarkable journey, filled with excitement, joy, invaluable learnings, and unforgettable experiences in India. While you aspire to join this amazing family of achievers Take a moment to listen to these inspiring stories that our Edoofian seniors have for their juniors.

08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon to you all
How are you doing?
08/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Afternoon Sir. We are very fine
08/02/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
08/02/24, 2:23 pm - Kunal: May I know how is everything going?
08/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 293 1063: I am going to do a deposit tomorrow for the enrollment fee. I could have done it a day ago but i travelled more than 200km away for family bereavement but i am travelling back to Harare today
08/02/24, 2:26 pm - Kunal: I understand
You see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities. 

So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?
08/02/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 293 1063: Fantastic i can have those details as well. They are more convenient to us
08/02/24, 2:30 pm - Kunal: *Ecocash/Mukuru Details of Mrs Jerera*
