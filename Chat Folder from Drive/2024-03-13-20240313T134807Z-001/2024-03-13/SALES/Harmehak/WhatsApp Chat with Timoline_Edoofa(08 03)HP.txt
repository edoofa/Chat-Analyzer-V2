12/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/03/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Timoline?
12/03/24, 10:30 am - +27 84 222 4718: A fully funded scholarship is a type of financial aid that covers the full cost of a student's education, including tuition, fees, books, and living expenses. It is a generous and life-changing opportunity that can open doors to a lot of possibilities.
12/03/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/03/24, 10:35 am - +27 84 222 4718: Ohhh  I understand thank you
12/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 383 2043: Thank you for the detailed explanation, it enlightens.
12/03/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome.
12/03/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Well received, Timoline, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/03/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

12/03/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright Timoline, where all have you been accepted?
12/03/24, 1:11 pm - +27 84 222 4718: ..Bindura University 
…NUST
12/03/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
12/03/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: You see,Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance.
12/03/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the same?
12/03/24, 1:21 pm - +27 84 222 4718: I did agree with them not many that have attended Universities in Zimbabwe have found employment hence my father has taken a step in wanting me to study abroad. I sorely believe that Edoofa would be a life changing opportunity
12/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement for the same.
12/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to enter medical field, Timoline?
12/03/24, 2:11 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Well, to be honest, there are a few different things that motivate me to pursue a career in the medical field. First and foremost, I have always had a passion for helping others. I find fulfillment in being able to make a positive impact on someone's life, and I know that a career in medicine will allow me to do just that. Secondly, I am fascinated by the animal body and how it functions. I am drawn to the challenge of understanding the complex workings of the body and using that knowledge to help others.
12/03/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Timoline!

So did you also happen to research about your desired fields?
12/03/24, 3:02 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Yes I did
12/03/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

I can see you didn't purse you Physics in your A level, 

I believe it's a crucial science subject and what is your take on the same, Timoline?
12/03/24, 3:25 pm - +27 84 222 4718: It is a crucial subject but it was either I did physics or biology so I opted for biology scince it is a requirement for the program of my choice <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
12/03/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/03/24, 3:33 pm - +27 84 222 4718: I see
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
12/03/24, 3:35 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Following
12/03/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: So far, what all did you understand, Timoline?
12/03/24, 3:41 pm - +27 84 222 4718: I understood that since my study subjects were per Zimbabwe’s requirements my options are limited to the above listed programs
12/03/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright.
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Biotechnology is closely connected to a Bachelor of Science in Veterinary Sciences or Technology through various overlapping areas of study and research. Here's how these two fields are interconnected:

Biomedical Research: Biotechnology involves the application of biological principles and techniques to develop products and technologies for various sectors, including medicine and healthcare. Veterinary Sciences also encompass research areas related to animal health, disease prevention, and treatment. Biotechnological research plays a significant role in advancing veterinary medicine by developing vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics for animal diseases.

Genetic Engineering: Both Biotechnology and Veterinary Sciences involve the study of genetics and genetic engineering techniques. Biotechnologists work on genetic modification and manipulation of organisms to enhance desirable traits, such as disease resistance or productivity. In Veterinary Sciences, genetic engineering techniques are used to breed animals with desired traits or to develop genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for various agricultural and biomedical purposes.

Animal Biotechnology: Animal Biotechnology is a specialized branch of biotechnology focused on the genetic improvement, health, and welfare of animals. It encompasses areas such as animal cloning, transgenic animal production, stem cell research, and reproductive biotechnologies. These advancements contribute to veterinary medicine by offering new tools and techniques for disease management, breeding programs, and biopharmaceutical production.

One Health Approach: Both Biotechnology and Veterinary Sciences align with the One Health concept, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Biotechnological innovations in vaccine development, disease diagnostics, and antimicrobial resistance research benefit both human and animal health, promoting a holistic approach to healthcare and disease prevention.

Biopharmaceuticals and Veterinary Medicine: Biotechnology plays a crucial role in the production of biopharmaceuticals, including vaccines, antibodies, and recombinant proteins, which are used in both human and veterinary medicine. Biotechnological methods are employed to produce veterinary vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of animal diseases.

Overall, a strong foundation in Biotechnology provides valuable insights and skills that are applicable to various aspects of Veterinary Sciences or Technology, particularly in areas related to biomedical research, genetic engineering, animal biotechnology, and biopharmaceutical production. Collaborations between professionals in these fields contribute to advancements in animal health, welfare, and veterinary medicine.

12/03/24, 5:44 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Wow 🔥
12/03/24, 5:44 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Followed through
12/03/24, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - +27 84 222 4718: No, we are not aware
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/03/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 5:54 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Kindly break down the cost to semester cost per year.
12/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Peter, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/03/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
12/03/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Exciting, she is listening. I'm sure she will rise to the occasion.😊
12/03/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same!
12/03/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/03/24, 6:08 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Following
12/03/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Timoline, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/03/24, 6:11 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Yes I do agree quite accurate
12/03/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: So now comparing the costs in India and Zimbabwe along with other countries,

Are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Timoline?

*Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/03/24, 6:14 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Well understood.
12/03/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
12/03/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything please?
12/03/24, 6:19 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Yes please, well understood <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 6:20 pm - +27 84 222 4718: So far so good
12/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis

Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/03/24, 6:28 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Great Staff and am sure Timoline would love and enjoy working with these having done Computer Science and attaining a Hexco  Certificate while at Marchwood.
12/03/24, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Mr Peter.
12/03/24, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/03/24, 6:32 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Very Noble.
12/03/24, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/03/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
12/03/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Timoline.
12/03/24, 6:50 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Ohhh now I have seen n noticed how different Edoofa’s program is
12/03/24, 6:52 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Noted
12/03/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/03/24, 6:58 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Yes I’m now ready
12/03/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Timoline as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/03/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/03/24, 7:01 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Very inspiring and I have known Timoline as a hard worker doing extra duties at Marchwood, running the school tuckshop and doing lots of voluntary work for the Leo Club.
12/03/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful!
12/03/24, 7:02 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Approx 1 500minimum
12/03/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/03/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/03/24, 7:05 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Following
12/03/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Timoline, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/03/24, 7:07 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Yes, it indeed is
12/03/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/03/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/03/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/03/24, 7:10 pm - +263 77 383 2043: Well noted.
12/03/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
12/03/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/03/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.

12/03/24, 7:12 pm - +27 84 222 4718: Followed through
12/03/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/03/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/03/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

12/03/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

12/03/24, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “13-03-24” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
