03/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: *Meanwhile I would like to add that now we have five students who will be traveling to India from Mt Selinda High School for their higher education through the Edoofa Program in the August 2024 intake and one student for the August 2025 intake.*

1. Belinda Dube 
2. Tadiwanashe Marwa
3. Munashe Hlahla
4. Katsaura Vimbai Audrey
5. Chimbirimbiri Lenon
6. Trevor Kaiboni
03/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 385 6297: How many A level points do you consider for a student to qualify for entry into the university
03/02/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
03/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 385 6297: Iam confident prosper will score high points
03/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
03/02/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share Prosper's O level results and A level subject combination?
03/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 385 6297: A level subjects 

Animal science 
Biology 
Mathematics 
Geography
03/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 385 6297: O level results  

I will sent when l get to where they are
03/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 385 6297: But he passed all the subjects he wrote
03/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
03/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

So what would be like to pursue for his higher education in India, Mr Moffat?
03/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 77 385 6297: You would better advise me considering his subject combination. 

He wanted to do medicine but lam told that he was supposed to do chemestry to qualify
03/02/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Physics, Chemistry are crucial requirements!
03/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

Along with *Bachelor in Geography* as per his subject combination! <This message was edited>

03/02/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, so now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
03/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Thank you,  go ahead
03/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

03/02/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Wishing you all a blessed weekend!
03/02/24, 9:34 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes l was following.
03/02/24, 9:46 pm - +263 77 430 6871: Thank you  same to you
05/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 385 6297: Good Morning. Iam ready but some network challenges
05/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Thats great!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 385 6297: Iam not aware.
05/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Well thats fine .
05/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 385 6297: I hope you will approve my child's scholarship .I will be happy because l cannot afford  that much on my own
05/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Moffat, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
05/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: We accepted. Thank you
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs and affordability, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 385 6297: He can reduce his annual fees through the earn while you learn. If there is any balance, I will pay it
05/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 385 6297: It's fine
05/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Fine ,Iam following.
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 385 6297: No I don't have.
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Great!
05/02/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , I agree
05/02/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: So after going through the costs of education in India, Mr Moffat, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education Affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , Edoofa is making education affordable.
05/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: MR Moffat, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 385 6297: 1500=2500
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Mr Moffat?

You can also connect with Munashe Hlahla and her guardian as she is also a part of the program for 2025 intake as Munashe is currently in Upper 6 with Prosper.
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Do you have their contact no
05/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Let me check with Mrs Magret first!
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with Mrs Ruth, Mr Moffat?
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Yes , she said that she come back to me in the evening
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
05/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be connecting you with Mrs Magret too once she is online.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Iam reading through.
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Ok ok. We can proceed to step 2 .
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

08/02/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

08/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 385 6297: I've gone through.
08/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Were you able to connect with Mrs Magret?
08/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
08/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Great!
08/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: So, Mr Moffat, now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/02/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 385 6297: 1)Bachelor of science in medical laboratory 

2)India 

3)us$6000 =$8000

4)$1200

5)$350 

7) 7days

8) yes
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Excellent, I am glad you thoroughly followed the entire discussion, Mr Moffat!
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 385 6297: You are welcome
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Moffat, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Prosper's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 385 6297: It's OK
08/02/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Could you please acknowledge using a voice note if you are willing to support Prosper?
08/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 385 6297: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
09/02/24, 8:25 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Dear parents!

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to engage in a discussion!
09/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 385 6297: Morning
09/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, did you follow the same?
09/02/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 385 6297: Yes
09/02/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?* <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 385 6297: Iam willing but we have to agree when the 7days counting will start
09/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 385 6297: Option 1
09/02/24, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Are you financially prepared for the same?

Please acknowledge using a voice note.
09/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 385 6297: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Duly noted!
09/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: I do appreciate your support for Prosper,

So the available slot for the video call interview with the Program Director for today is 12:30 PM CAT.

While you would have a short video call of 5-10 minutes with the Director, later on you can also share queries using voice notes!
09/02/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any question for me?
09/02/24, 11:24 am - Harmehak: . <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 385 6297: Do you have any restrictions on religion as the students go to college
09/02/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: There are no restrictions on religion. Students are free to practice their faith, and we encourage a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone can express their religious beliefs freely. 

Many students visit church every sunday, reflecting the rich cultural and religious diversity found in India. 

We respect and celebrate each individual's right to follow the religion of their choice.
09/02/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Is there anything else that you would like to ask?
09/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 385 6297: Normally, how many semesters are in a year and in which month does the first semester start
09/02/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: There are two semesters every year,

The intakes start in August.
09/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 385 6297: Does it mean, if approved, prosper will start in August
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Prosper will start in Augsut 2025 along with other students from Mt Selinda like Munashe!
09/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 385 6297: Ok.
09/02/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
09/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 385 6297: What are the total traveling expenses from Zimb to  India by air
09/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
09/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Understood
09/02/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.
2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3. Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
09/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 385 6297: As the student will be doing EWYL , what kind of work will he be doing? Is the work related to the program he will be studying at college
09/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, like we were discussing on Monday, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Iam a bit confused.  When does a student start EWYL?
09/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

17/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: That's great
17/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account (Mr Needmore Maposa, principal of Chibuwe High school) over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
17/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 385 6297: I need direct bank
17/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 385 6297: 1
17/02/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: You see, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
17/02/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: For your knowledge shall I brief you about option 2 as well?

Since every parent from Mt Selinda opted for the same as it was more convenient. <This message was edited>
21/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Mr Moffat!

How are you doing today?
21/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moffat, I would like to hear from you regarding the preparations for the fee formalities,

Since the deadline is of day after tomorrow, by when are you expecting to complete the same?
21/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 385 6297: Friday.
21/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

Which mode will you be opting for please?
22/02/24, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Good morning, Mr Moffat!

Shall I also brief you about the payment mode using FBC of Mr Needmore Maposa, Principal of Chibuwe High school?
22/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 385 6297: Morning.  Yes brief me
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Sure please.
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
22/02/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare
