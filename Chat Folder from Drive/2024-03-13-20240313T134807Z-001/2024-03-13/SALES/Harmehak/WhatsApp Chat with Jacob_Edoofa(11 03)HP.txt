Your hardwork assisted you thoroughly.
11/03/24, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parent and Jacob, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 650 2655: Yeah
11/03/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Jacob, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 650 2655: Yup
11/03/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Jacob, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
11/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 650 2655: Well, I wrote my A levels last year and got 2 A's and a B. I'd like to study bachelors in chemical engineering or pharmaceutical. I'm passionate about chemistry hence the choice in studying chemical engineering. Weakness, I'm a bit impatient with people 😅. Hobbies, I like reading and I used to play rugby and chess in school.
11/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Well received please!

I await the response to the other half of the question.
11/03/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: A detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?
