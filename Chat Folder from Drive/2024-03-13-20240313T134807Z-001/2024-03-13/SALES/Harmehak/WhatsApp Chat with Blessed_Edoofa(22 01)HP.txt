25/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Oh yes
25/01/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
25/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Definitely confident
25/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

25/01/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the same, Mr Gilbert?
25/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes
25/01/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: I am glad,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
25/01/24, 6:46 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes  without assistant can't afford without scholarship
25/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please.
25/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes I follow India is affordable
25/01/24, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Gilbert, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
25/01/24, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if they are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, they would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
25/01/24, 6:54 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok
25/01/24, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Mr Gilbert?
25/01/24, 6:57 pm - +263 77 546 1488: I wish them good results as you are saying
25/01/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
25/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
25/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok understood
25/01/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Great, now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you as well as your children, Mr Gilbert.
25/01/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/01/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
25/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok
25/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

25/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/01/24, 7:37 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Mr Gilbert?
25/01/24, 7:40 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes I did
25/01/24, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
25/01/24, 7:43 pm - +263 77 546 1488: So far so good not knowing when is the approval
25/01/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: I will guide you with that as well.
25/01/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/01/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok
25/01/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well.

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
25/01/24, 8:10 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes
25/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
25/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/01/24, 8:13 pm - +263 77 546 1488: $1500-$2250
25/01/24, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/01/24, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
25/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok
25/01/24, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/01/24, 8:24 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ya  it is
25/01/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/01/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
25/01/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
25/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/01/24, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: Kindly acknowledge if you have followed the process, Mr Gilbert. <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes I followed
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
25/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
25/01/24, 9:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Mr Gilbert?
26/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Mr Gilbert, I hope you are doing well.

I believe you have followed the discussion so far?
26/01/24, 9:25 pm - +263 77 546 1488: I'm fine good good evening
26/01/24, 9:25 pm - Harmehak: That's good.
26/01/24, 9:26 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
26/01/24, 9:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 9:26 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
26/01/24, 9:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

28/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

29/01/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
29/01/24, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

Mr Gilbert, now that you are aware of the entire finances involved and the process for both your children,

Are you willing to support them financially as well mentally?
31/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes I will

01/02/24, 11:31 am - +263 77 546 1488: Morning
01/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
01/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

02/02/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: I understand please!

That's very correct!
02/02/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: So Mr Gilbert now the application will be submitted for the further evaluation where a video call interview will be scheduled with the Program Director!

It will be a call for 10-15 minutes itself!

02/02/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: @263775461488 

Are we connected?
02/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 546 1488: No let me ask for help
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Slot me 1 pm
02/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
02/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure you are in a stable network for the interview.
02/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
02/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
02/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
02/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same please, Mr Gilbert?
02/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Yes
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Kindly initiate the interview in that case please.
02/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation in the interview please!
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Ok
02/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Kindly respond in the interview group.
02/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 546 1488: But network problem
02/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: You can communicate with Mrs Guneet using voice notes now in that case.
02/02/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Mr Gilbert?
02/02/24, 9:38 pm - Harmehak: Good evening, I hope you are doing well!

05/02/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Alright, Mr Gilbert!

In that case, may I know what all would you like to ask from the Letter of Acceptance?

*I believe you must have seen that Blessed was offered a higher quantum of scholarship as well!*
05/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Good day so far so good .yes I ve seen he was offered
05/02/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Thank you so much
05/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please, Mr Gilbert!
05/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account (Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School) over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
05/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 546 1488: I wish to use number one Parent Company 's  account
05/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
05/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: For your convenience shall I brief you about second mode as well?
05/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 546 1488: Brief me second mode
05/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
05/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore

ACC NUMBER: 5290638027654065

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664
