I learn at Lower Gwelo Adventist High School (also known as LOGAHS) and currently I'm doing my A'Level, as I'm looking forward to write my finals this year November. Our institution fees, termly is USD$150. I wish to study agricultural sciences so that we can improve the sector of agriculture. I like crop science which enhance our knowledge and skills on  how to produce adequate food for the people which comes forth with a balanced diet and so on. I've got challenges on some new concepts of some areas of study but i'm trying to grasp them. I love reading books, magazines or anything that talks about health and researching more on that because l'm a vegan. I also like nature, just seeing the wonders of God with my young sisters playing soft songs while enjoying ourselves. Briefly, that's all about me.

08/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 321 3292: Ok, i understand that Ma'am.
08/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 321 3292: Thank you so much
08/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Great!
08/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well Kelly now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 321 3292: Yes l do. Studying abroad makes you know different aspects of life i.e cultural, social, economical and so forth. It helps in implementing new skills and knowledge in a particular place to make life better for everyone. This leads to a good knowledge of life. It's also good for pleasure, adventurer, entertainment. greener pastures etc
08/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 321 3292: adventure*
08/03/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: That's well put across!

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/03/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 321 3292: Also good for educational purposes, I think so
08/03/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Kelly, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 321 3292: By God's Grace i'm prepared
08/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/03/24, 11:15 am - +263 78 321 3292: Yes I agree. My parents are willing to support me
08/03/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/03/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 321 3292: Alright Ma'am, I got it. Thank you, I promise to do so.
08/03/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Great, so, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
08/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 321 3292: Do you need a screenshot? Unfortunately now I don't have, the documents are home and i'm at school
08/03/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: I do understand!

Kindly share them later.
08/03/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 321 3292: Ummm, I had asked Mom take a pic for me
08/03/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

You can add your mother in the group as well.

12/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 321 3292: It was a substitution for Maths. My Olevel grade for Maths wasn't good for me to opt for A'level Maths
12/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 321 3292: 😁😁😁
12/03/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: I do understand!

You opted for Geography in A level as well, may I know more about the same?
12/03/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 321 3292: And furthermore, for us to improve the agriculture sector, we should analyse processed data, gathered and illustrated so that we predict future plans
12/03/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 321 3292: Actually, I had chose biology but the school administration discouraged me because they said I had passed Geography than biology, but anyway it's still good for the combination because it corresponds with crop science on location, land, pedology and so forth
12/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
12/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, let me brief you about Geography and how it would resemble to your aspirations itself!
12/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 321 3292: Ok, thanks
12/03/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
12/03/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.
12/03/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 321 3292: Got it
12/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 321 3292: That's true,, it goes hand in glove with agriculture. I strongly agree
12/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Also corresponding to population studies, food production in different geographical location [eg LEDCs and MEDCs]
12/03/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same!
12/03/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Now that you have a better clarity, shall I brief you about Bachelors in Geography?
12/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Great
12/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes Ma'am
12/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Can I ask Ma'am?
12/03/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
12/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 321 3292: From my combination, which other careers can I choose
12/03/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: While your subject combination has different subjects,

You can pursue arts and commercials for your higher education along with the same you can pursue Bachelor in Economics for your fondness for Statistics.

However for your interests in crop science and Geography, Bachelor of arts honors in Geography would cater for your interests. <This message was edited>

12/03/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Now I'll encourage my friends, colleagues to hold on to Geo even though it seems to be tough
12/03/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Kelly!
12/03/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: So far would you like to ask anything?
12/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ma'am, you know what? I just wanna improve pomology and olericulture for our health, floriculture for eg the beauty of our homes etc, plantation crops, spices and condiments etc
12/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ummm, no. I can hear from you
12/03/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know of your kind motives, Kelly.
12/03/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright Kelly, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/03/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Some people they say they can't afford buying common fruits frequently eg apples, oranges, bananas etc in supermarkets so I just wanna be of help that each family should have a small garden that will have these. They also say herbs, spices, condiments for cooking, relishes, baking and so forth,,,, all the kitchen products are too expensive to purchase.
I think helping them to grow some in their gardens will help.
I don't know if my thoughts are of good help and of a quality to apply to our day to day lives
12/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I think in the next 5years I'll be a great community lecturer who will teach people mainly on their health, ie adding much of their vegetables and fruits to their diets, meals, food, as well as how to produce those plants so that everyone won't be crying of expensiveness of such basic/common products in supermarkets
12/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Joining the Edoofa program will enable me , mainly, to have more education, gaining more knowledge and techniques on how to carry out my plans, thoughts.That's what I think
12/03/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I'm now going for lunch Ma'am, if possible kindly asking to be back later
12/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 321 3292: They may purchase some, but some taking from their own home, own produce i.e gardens
12/03/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 321 3292: For a common example,, it's better to take cabbage and tomatoes in the garden then purchase salt and cooking oil from the supermarket. I think that balances family budgets. 

To others, it will be difficult to purchase cabbage, tomatoes, the salt and cooking oil from markets all at once
12/03/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Kindly analyse my thoughts
12/03/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
12/03/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Kelly, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

You have managed to express your thoughts well,

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I'm done
12/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 321 3292: The reason is I wanna learn new skills that'll I'll implement here
12/03/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Kelly,

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ummmm,, to be honest I don't know much about India but I believe it's enjoyable.

A little knowledge I have is that India has a higher quality of education in teaching about medicine
12/03/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 321 3292: And if not mistaken, India uses massive quantities of spices, herbs, condiments, ointments for various purposes, meaning they have the knowledge on how to produce such
12/03/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 321 3292: And I also learn a little from watching Indian movies,, were they express they're culture, way of living etc
12/03/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the knowledge you have, Kelly.

12/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I can even see the CEOs of different businesses and programs,, all the wonders and prestige of your Country 🫡
12/03/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Kelly.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/03/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ummm,, I don't have any idea
12/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Here in Zimbabwe, the cost ranges from USD$700 to USD$1000+  per semester in most universities
12/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Especially for Sciences
12/03/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That's true

The tuition fee is around $700-800 per semester there in Zimbabwe.
12/03/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yeah
12/03/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/03/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/03/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 321 3292: 🥺😳😳😳
12/03/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
12/03/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok Ma'am
12/03/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/03/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Noted
12/03/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Studied the graph
12/03/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/03/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 321 3292: That's good to hear. It lightens the responsibly of parents to support us financially during academics. Furthermore, all what you do contributes the a small section of humans [parents]: their Health. Financial instability leads to stresses, depressions etc which is not good for our lives.
12/03/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.
12/03/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Kelly, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/03/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 321 3292: That's true,,now a plate of sadza costs $2 for 1 person currently 🤣🙌🏻🙌🏻. 
Even our staple food is now an expensive product to have.
12/03/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I strongly agree on that one. People are struggling just for food, before mentioning other basic needs you outlined above.
12/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please.
12/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Correct, Kelly!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes Ma'am
12/03/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/03/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/03/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/03/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Well received Ma'am.
I can see objectives of the program and outputs of it from students
12/03/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/03/24, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/03/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Umm Ma'am,,are u asking me to explain or...? Kindly clarify
12/03/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: I shared an example with you
12/03/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok ok I get it
12/03/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes Ma'am, I've understood better. Thank you
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: That's good
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 15 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
12/03/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Noted Ma'am.
Which projects and assignments we should carry out?
Kindly elaborate
12/03/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/03/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Alright
12/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/03/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 321 3292: So immaculate
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes, I've seen it
12/03/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared pictures and video as well, Kelly?
12/03/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes I did,, for now I'm watching this recent one while reading the article written just below
12/03/24, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/03/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes I am ma'am
12/03/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Kelly, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/03/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 321 3292: The student ends up spending $1500- $2250
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

12/03/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
12/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok noted Ma'am
12/03/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Noted
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok ok Ma'am. Thank you🙏.
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Kelly, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/03/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok I get. 
How do we make the transactions
12/03/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok Ma'am.
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
12/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 321 3292: I'm listening 👂
12/03/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Understood
12/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 321 3292: well taken
12/03/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any question for me?
12/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes Ma'am 
Are you the one who'll send the reservation letter?
12/03/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Which reservation letter are you referring to please, Kelly?
12/03/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Here Ma'am 👆🏻
12/03/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: It would be shared over Email by the Academic Board.
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Ok ok Ma'am. 
Thank you
12/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Yes Ma'am, clear now
12/03/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

12/03/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/03/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

12/03/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: So far, what all would you like to ask?
12/03/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 321 3292: Umm, for now there's nothing
12/03/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please

Your parents can participate moving forward as well when you won't be available.
12/03/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/03/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
