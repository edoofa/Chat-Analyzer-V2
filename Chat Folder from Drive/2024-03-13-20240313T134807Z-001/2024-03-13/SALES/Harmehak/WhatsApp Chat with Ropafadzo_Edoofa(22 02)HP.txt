23/02/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Mrs Tabeth, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
23/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 603 1331: Sure may you shade more light on that one
23/02/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

23/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 603 1331: Now l understand
23/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 603 1331: We are not familiar Ms Harhak?
23/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 603 1331: How much is it?
23/02/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/02/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Thank you so much for this information so how much do l pay per semester
23/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
23/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 603 1331: You said you pay 50 percent of the tuition how do you go about this
23/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Mrs Tabeth?
23/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Okey l see
23/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: So as of now do you have any queries?
23/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 603 1331: No thank you  do you offer jobs to the students after the completion of their courses or they have to find jobs on their own
23/02/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
23/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Waaaal wonderful
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
23/02/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tabeth, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 603 1331: At University of Zimbabwe it's $700 per semester and there are two semesters per year
23/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Correct, which makes $1400 just for the tuition fee!

Like I mentioned, the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year.

Cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time, This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food.

This make 1400+1100 that is $2500 just for tuition and food for UZ.
23/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: While cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and traveling end up another total of $1000 a year.
23/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 603 1331: I will find out
23/02/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Since you are already aware of the tuition fee,

Wouldn't you agree with the other costs like food and accommodation along with internet, travel for a year?

I believe you must be already aware of the same, isn't it?
23/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yes
23/02/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: So now you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the *Earn While You Learn Program*.
23/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yaa sure
23/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the Earn While You Learn Program, Mrs Tabeth?
23/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 603 1331: There is nothing bad about it let's hear from Ropafadzo
23/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Sure please Mrs Tabeth!

Once we conclude the discussion today I would provide you with more resources and also connect you with a parent who has daughters in India. <This message was edited>
23/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 603 1331: It's a good idea you can do so .l am eagerly waiting
23/02/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
23/02/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Thank you for shading more light
23/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
23/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 603 1331: It's a good program
23/02/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
23/02/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?
23/02/24, 5:10 pm - +263 77 603 1331: I am travelling l think in 30 minutes time l will be connected
23/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!
23/02/24, 6:23 pm - +263 77 603 1331: I am now ready Ms Harmehak
23/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tabeth as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/02/24, 6:28 pm - +263 77 603 1331: A lot of money
23/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 6:46 pm - +263 77 603 1331: It means if l fail to pay $350 before 29 February I will be paying $750 in March is that so?
23/02/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: No please,!

The fee is $350 for Ropafadzo if found eligible within February, after the same you pay her enrollment fee!
23/02/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tabeth, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
23/02/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/02/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/02/24, 6:53 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Okey l understand now but the challenge l am facing now l have to exam fee for my son who is writing his examinations this year so this month l cannot afford
23/02/24, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mrs Tabeth,

However the fee is paid in installments and after Ropafadzo is found eligible for the program and receives an acceptance letter.
23/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Thank you
23/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 77 603 1331: That way l can manage
23/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
23/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/02/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Mrs Tabeth?
23/02/24, 8:21 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yes l understand thank for the effort
23/02/24, 8:21 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Are you in India right now
23/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/02/24, 8:28 pm - +263 77 603 1331: May l have the contacts of some parents who have their students in India through this program
23/02/24, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/02/24, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

23/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: I believe you are already in touch with Munyaradzi as well please?
23/02/24, 8:42 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yes l am in touch with him and he is the one who gave us this information about Edoofa
23/02/24, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please,

Do connect with Munyaradzi to learn about his experience along with Mrs Ruth please.
23/02/24, 8:47 pm - +263 77 603 1331: I will do so thank you so much Ms Harmehak
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/02/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
24/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
24/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 603 1331: Good morning Ms Harmehak how are you this morning
24/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 603 1331: Yes you may proceed with my application
24/02/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please, thank you!
24/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: So how was the discussion as a family, Mrs Tabeth?

What all did you happen to discuss?
24/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 603 1331: The family is impressed about this program ,our only fear is that are we able to pay the fees given a chance when our daughter is selected
24/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, which fee are you referring to please?
24/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 603 1331: I heard you need about $1 500 for the whole process before she depart to India
24/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Is this so?
24/02/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Could you please rephrase which $1500 are you referring to please, Mrs Tabeth?
24/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Firstly you need $350 then $700 for flight and then the remaining l am not sure .May you help me to know how much exactly do you want so that we can make our budgets  accordingly
24/02/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tabeth, If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
24/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Flights start from the range $350-390 itself, the choice of airlines you choose increase the costs please.
24/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Thank you so much now l understand
24/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please!

24/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please, Mrs Tabeth!
24/02/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask please?
24/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Alright Ms Harmehak let's say Ropafadzo has been accepted into this program as a parent what can l prepare for her for example type of clothes ,blankets only to mention a few

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

To a greater extent it is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.Due to the rainfall patterns of the recent years the yields of many Africans are on the demise sometimes they will be low rainfall that cause the plants to die before they are yielded and to some points they might be high rainfall that destroys the plants before they are finally yielded that may cause the Africans to repeat the same diets .
Moving on due to inefficient ,Africans have poor diets , sometimes they do not have variety of plants to grow in their field that may cause them to repeat starch every meal that may result in this poor diets .To a lesser extent it's not true because of diffence in regions ,farmers in region 1 and 2 they experience enough rainfall and have good soils so they will not suffer from poor diets so to some extent it's false .Farming to Africans is the pillar because some farm and produces good yields they sell their produce and they have enough those farmers will never suffer from inefficient but how ever the statement is true to those living in region 5 or 6 they suffer from poor diets this places might include Dande valley ,Dotito to mention a few .

Section 6 
Confidence and high self- esteem was never my thing ,from my primary level what l would do was so awkward yes it was .

I did not have that voice to say things so sometimes l would use my body language to express things and the result would came up embrassing l still remember when my Grade 6 teacher asked if any one was able to pin the chart on the wall l did not lift my hand l just stood up took a bucket so that l will step to pin the chart on the wall by so doing l fall l was so embrassed yes so l pretended like l was hurt and started crying that cry was not not of hurt it was of  shame ,l lost my confidence from that moment . 

So ,when l attended my Secondary school ,l was so happy .On my first day l went to the classes as l was walking by the corridor l fall and there was a multitude of people there l was laughed at and that alone made me so miserable.
In class l did not want to raise my hand to give an answer ,even with my friend did not even raise a point because l was afraid to do that because of my past experiences.l reached Form 3 .that was the time when leaders at the church fellowship some may call it scripture union was being ordained l did not have any hopes that l will be part of that and rather was afraid to lead too because l thought l will always be embrassed .As names of the leaders were being called out then at last l heard my name ,at first was confused yes but later was filled with fear someone pushed me to go to the front ohh that made it more difficult for me and to turn around hearing shouts and the clapping of hands was another thing .

This was a new chapter indeed l would go in front of people to say church programs of the day ,that build me and sometimes l would hear people saying I wish l was Ropafadzo that made me believe in myself ,and also it build my confidence l was now a role model at this school from an awkward to a role model a superstar a leader or l might say a celebrity that is "My inspirational Story".
25/02/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Received please!

Let me submit the same for evaluation.
26/02/24, 4:17 am - +263 77 603 1331: Thanks
26/02/24, 8:57 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well please
26/02/24, 8:57 am - Harmehak: While I get the test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you to a few of my questions.

Mrs Tabeth, I wanted to ask that for the same, could you be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question? <This message was edited>
26/02/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 603 1331: Good morning Ms Harmehak l am available but Ropafadzo has gone to town and l understand her fon is down
26/02/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

Mrs Tabeth, now that you understood entire process and the details along with the finances,

I would like to know from you if as a parent you are willing to support Ropafadzo's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?
26/02/24, 11:41 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yes please
27/02/24, 7:22 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well.
27/02/24, 7:23 am - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
27/02/24, 7:23 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
27/02/24, 7:23 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
27/02/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 603 1331: Yes please
27/02/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
27/02/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
27/02/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/02/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th of March 2024 for $200 and the 6th or 7th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th of March 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

27/02/24, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
28/02/24, 5:22 am - +263 77 603 1331: I would opt for the first one of paying the first one around 7 March then the remaining in April 7th

04/03/24, 7:18 am - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
04/03/24, 7:18 am - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
