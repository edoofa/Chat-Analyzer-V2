08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you
08/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 314 2917: I'm so pleased with this Edoofa schoolarship program l wanted you to assist us on what's to be done
08/03/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Dear Parent and Peter, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 314 2917: Ok noted
08/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Okay so Peter, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 884 0645: Ok thank you, i think i have the qualifications to meet the desired standards

08/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you very much what a guide.
08/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, Peter!

I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
08/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Thank you with the information you provided above it is helpful and it is motivating me to pursue to continue my studies in acquiring a masters degree, the MBA which can open more opportunities and i also like the learning process mentioned above which involves presentations, quizzes and practical its so fascinating thank you with your guidance Ms Harmehak
08/03/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Peter!
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Ok noted
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Ok noted
08/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Ok noted we can try  our level best but as i have alluded prior into this is that zimbabwe we are experiencing  our hardest at the moment.
08/03/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

The details regarding the costs have been discussed with Peter already before he applied please.

However, currently he is being offered a higher quantum of scholarship where $1200-1800 includes his tuition fee, accomodation, food and basic university expenses.
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Ok noted  no problem
08/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 314 2917: I understand, It's a  reasonable amount thank you
08/03/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Did you inform your parents about the same earlier too, Peter?
08/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes i did
08/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
08/03/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Peter, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 314 2917: I agree with you
08/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thats true
08/03/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 270 2256: I agee with you.
08/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Thank you
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I believe now comparing the same with costs in Zimbabwe you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
08/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Yes  you offer affordable higher international studies .
08/03/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Yes it is
08/03/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
08/03/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So what all do you remember regarding the Earn While You Learn Program, Peter?
08/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 71 884 0645: This message was deleted
08/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I remember that in addition of experiencing high quality education a student is also able to earn money whilst studying, the apprenticeship help a student to raise money for extra use
08/03/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Ok thank you now i have better understanding
08/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/03/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/03/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I now know the importance of EWYL program and it is much helpful especially in lowering the annual school fees which is a great thing
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Peter!
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/03/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Wow so much students participating in the EWYL and the best part of the program is that there is no limitation on the student earnings, I'm highly motivated to participate in the program
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Peter, I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
08/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Everything was crystal clear and I'm also having this inner push in myself to be able to reach earnings like other students are earning
08/03/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that, Peter!

I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes my parents are the ones going to be supporting me for my higher education
08/03/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges up front, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/03/24, 2:21 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Yes im aware of the fee and you can assist me in understanding in how to make the application fee affordable
08/03/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Peter!
08/03/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
08/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 884 0645: OK i understand
08/03/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/03/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
08/03/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of USD 50 in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.*

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
08/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 270 2256: We are here to support  him thank you so much  Ms . Harmehak
08/03/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement please!
08/03/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Its a great opportunity indeed, i understand
08/03/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/03/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: However Peter, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Thank you for the payment plan
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/03/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/03/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I understand the cycle from step 1 to 5
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you, that is managable we can afford  to do that.
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/03/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 2:59 pm - +263 71 884 0645: Step 6 understood
08/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!
08/03/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Your parents can connect with Mrs Ruth as well.
08/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Ok let me connect with her
08/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 270 2256: Yes we will connect to her  thank you.
08/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Great!

So far, what all would you like to ask please?
08/03/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 884 0645: I think everything is clear i  understand
08/03/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/03/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/03/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

09/03/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
09/03/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: You cannot work in India on a student visa please.

09/03/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: That's a personal choice please.

Usually our students enjoy staying in India during holidays and explore the country.

However if they wish to visit back, they can do the same as well please.
09/03/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 314 2917: Ok l understand
09/03/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Have you all already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

09/03/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: It's good to know that you were able to have a thorough discussion, Peter.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

It is not true that many Africans have poor diets because of their farms stagnant and in efficient. At first chain costs and related issues are a major obstacle to the renaissance of African agriculture. Making food supply chains more efficient and profitable requires reliable and efficient delivery of upstream goods and services, as well as downstream delivery of the goods to market.
In these days Africa have improved their diet due to use of fertilizer and also the use of GMOs.
In some cases many Africans improve their soil fertility due to use of manures 
Some Africans are in wind wide side when they receive rainfall which is more than 2500mm.
The Government supplies offers subsidies so as to reduce food cost
From successful macro economic policies growth result in giving people land to that there project and they also help them to build green houses
However, low-fertility soils, environmental degradation, scant technology and poor infrastructure were thwarting Africa’s best efforts to develop the agricultural sector, he said.  Smallholder farmers, mostly women, who produced at least 90 per cent of the continent’s food supply, were particularly affected but lacked the money to make improvements.  “Unless that trend is reversed, Africa will not be able to feed its population,” he warned, stressing that realization of the Millennium Development Goals would remain elusive without outside support.


Echoing those concerns, Ethiopia’s representative said the agricultural sector, which had suffered years of neglect and under-investment, must be placed high on the international development agenda, with greater spending on agricultural production — be it through official development

MY INSPIRATIONATIONAL STORY

Growing up as a child i always have one dream and that is to make my parents happy. Putting a smile on their faces is my only goal, but it is not that easy and that it is why i have decided to take my studies seriously. My dream career is to become a Financial analyst in that way i feel my parents will be proud of me. Somewhere in life, we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt but there is always someone behind the ourselves who would aspire us to shine in doing enormous things. My parents are the ones who stand up with me and mend my words. Seeing my parents suffering while working too hard in the sun just to give me a brighter future inspires me. Because of their efforts and warmth love, im inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life. Having a debt of gratitude to them, make me to pay all their hard works by giving them a marvellous life someday. To the point where I am right now i have been studying hard not only for myself but for my family
09/03/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Received please!

Let me get it evaluated!
11/03/24, 8:25 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well.

I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
11/03/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 270 2256: Noted thank you
11/03/24, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Dear parent, now that you have followed the entire discussion and the process,

Given the finances and the details of the program, are you willing to support your child both mentally and financially?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.
11/03/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 270 2256: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: You see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
11/03/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
11/03/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
11/03/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 270 2256: Yes i am willing to support having considered the Edoofa program it gives me energy  to support  him to the fullest.
11/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/03/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th March 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th March 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 270 2256: Thank you me i will opt that first one but i am very confident  that i will bit the deadline of 17 or 18th of march.
