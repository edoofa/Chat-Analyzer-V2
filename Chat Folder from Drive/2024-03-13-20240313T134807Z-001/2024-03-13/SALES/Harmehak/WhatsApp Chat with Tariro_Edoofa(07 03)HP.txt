08/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you so much ma'am .I  do hope I could've have done better.
08/03/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome and I appreciate your positive attitude. <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parent and Tariro, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 3:54 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes we did and we appreciate what it is offering to students who want to attain a good education abroad but do not have the financial resources required
08/03/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate! <This message was edited>
08/03/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Tariro, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I believe I do have what it takes to meet the four significant metrics required to get a higher quantum of scholarship
08/03/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Tariro, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
08/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I'm Tariro Garikai. I'm 18 years of age. I was born on the twenty-first of August 2005.

 When I was in form two, I did not qualify to be in the science class hence I got into the commercial class. I took private science subject lessons and I managed to excel in my O level exams with 7 A's and 6 B's. I then chose to do maths, physics and computer science for my A level and I managed to excel with straight A's too. This  led me to want to study computer science and engineering at my tertiary level.

My biggest strength is that I'm a goal getter and I am a very hardworking person. I know what I want and I can face any given situation no matter what comes in my way. However one of my weaknesses is that I lack confidence when it comes to public speaking, which is something I am working towards my betterment. 

I would describe myself as a very outgoing person. I'm a good athlete and I enjoy participating in sporting activities like netball and girls soccer. 

I come from a family of 4 children with me being the first born. My mother is an account's clerk and she works for Zimra while my father is an independent small scale farmer.
08/03/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tariro, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your siblings?
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Well I'm a the first born of four. My younger sister, Talent Garikai, who takes after me is in form 4 and is sitting for her O level exams this year. The last borns are twins, Chipochashe and Chipochashe Garikai, and they are in grade seven.
08/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about them, Tariro!
08/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your results in a picture format with me?
08/03/24, 4:50 pm - +263 73 242 2020: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 4:50 pm - +263 73 242 2020: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Great results, Tariro!
08/03/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Received please.
08/03/24, 4:52 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: So now let me brief you about your desired course, Tariro!

08/03/24, 5:07 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you for the above information. I appreciate the help and such insight
08/03/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
08/03/24, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, Tariro!

I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/03/24, 5:21 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I am well aware ma'am
08/03/24, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Let me share something exciting!

As per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
08/03/24, 5:31 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Wow that's exciting indeed. I'm excited to learn what the reward for good performance has to offer. This will also help my parents financially and relieve them of the financial burdens that come with sending a child abroad for their education
08/03/24, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Tariro!
08/03/24, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Tariro, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/03/24, 5:42 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I agree. Life can be quite expensive in Zimbabwean
08/03/24, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Tariro!
08/03/24, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Now comparing the same with costs in India,

I believe you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
08/03/24, 5:49 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Edoofa is definitely making higher education affordable and accessible for international students. The Earn while you learn program is definitely the highlight of it all. It will allow me to help my parents in paying for my fees and this gives me hope that I can actually study abroad without stressing my parents much on how they will raise the money.
08/03/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across, Tariro.
08/03/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/03/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/03/24, 5:56 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Well noted ma'am. I'd really be excited if such an opportunity would be offered to me. The EWYL program comes with a lot of learning and advantages that I'd be really grateful for.
08/03/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Tariro.

And you definitely get that opportunity to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program and that too while you are still in Zimbabwe.
08/03/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/03/24, 6:04 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Well noted ma'am and thank you so much for clarifying that there is no limit anyhow on which a student can earn scholarship credits.
08/03/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Tariro!
08/03/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not, you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education, Tariro?
08/03/24, 6:11 pm - +263 73 242 2020: My parents will be the ones supporting me for my higher education. They'll be trying their level best to provide
08/03/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support efforts to support your higher education.
08/03/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: So, Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges up front, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/03/24, 6:14 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes ma'am, I'm ready
08/03/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
08/03/24, 6:18 pm - +263 73 242 2020: What does the slice con include
08/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Let me share more resources regarding the same once we conclude the discussion so that you can go through them thoroughly.
08/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
08/03/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: *Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of USD 50 in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund.*

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
08/03/24, 6:25 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I'm really honoured to be part of the few who have been offered this opportunity. Thank you so much
08/03/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Tariro.
08/03/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
08/03/24, 6:28 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Wow that's amazing. My parents would really appreciate the extension considering their current financial situation
08/03/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tariro.
08/03/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/03/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/03/24, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/03/24, 6:32 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I have ma'am and I'm eager to learn till the last step
08/03/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/03/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/03/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/03/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 6:33 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Well noted.
08/03/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/03/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/03/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 6:37 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you. I really appreciate this.
08/03/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
08/03/24, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/03/24, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/03/24, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

08/03/24, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Tariro.

I appreciate your kind words.
09/03/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
09/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 73 242 2020: Good morning ma'am. We discussed the points and we can proceed with the application now
09/03/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Alright Tariro!

So how was the discussion with your parents please?
09/03/24, 11:46 am - +263 73 242 2020: My parents seemed very eager and excited about this opportunity. A lot of doubts and mishaps were cleared in the process

09/03/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Have you all already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
09/03/24, 12:31 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Unfortunately my parents haven't yet contacted Mrs Ruth. But they will try to as soon as possible

Did you happen to connect, Tariro?

09/03/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tariro
09/03/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Section 5

Poor diets are one of the major causes of child deaths and a number of diseases such as kwashiorkor and scurvy in Africa. However, this is not due to African farms being stagnant and inefficient to a greater extent.

One of the leading causes of poor diets in Africa is poverty. Most families in Africa cannot afford to eat healthy balanced meals due to their financial situations. In most cases, the breadwinners can only afford to feed their families twice a day at most. This includes a light meal in the morning, usually porridge, which is considered as breakfast and a starchy meal at the end of the a busy day considered as supper.

Africa is well known for its fertile soils and vast forests. However, human activities such as deforestation have led to climate change. This has severe droughts throughout the continent and flooding in most parts as well. These droughts and floods have led to drastic reductions in the agricultural produce thus leading to poor unbalanced meals in most parts on the continent.

Unemployment is yet another growing issue leading to poor diets amongst most African communities. In the event that most pupils in Africa are afforded the opportunity to get an education, very few of them get employed in good reputable companies on completion of their education while many are left unemployed. The employers are few but the employees are many. This has led to a major imbalance in the socio-economic status's of many African countries. Unemployment leads to a lot of terrible inhuman situations and one of them is an unhealthy lifestyle, leading to a poor diet.

In addition to unemployment, lack of proper education is yet another cause of poor diets in Africa. As Nelson Mandela once said, "Education is the key to success", but sadly, it is a sad reality that only a few African children can be afforded a good education. Most African societies are still stuck up on the fact that onlyen should go to school while women stay at home and bear children. These young African mothers have little to no knowledge on how to raise a child and the required foods for a healthy balanced diet.

Lastly, overpopulation is  yet another cause of poor diets in most African communities. Most overpopulated communities survive on very few resources. This then leads to a lot of cases of malnutrition. Diseases like kwaah9, beriberi, goitre and scurvy are most rampant in the eastern parts of the continent and it is in these areas where overpopulation is an issue.

However to a lesser extent, in some parts of Africa, Africans have poor diets because their farms are indeed stagnant and inefficient. This is due to lack or farming resources in some cases. Corruption in most governments leads to most farmers being denied of their rights to receive adequate resource for their farming inputs.

Laziness is yet another reason why some African farms are stagnant and inefficient. Laziness is a powerful habit that it blinds people of the consequences of their actions. Some Africans would rather settle for poor diets than work hard for a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Section 6

Growing up as a sister of four, I knew I had to lead by example. Unlike most kids, my sister was more of a child than a sibling. From an early age, I knew I had to stand out, my worst fear being another mediocre statistic. The pressure to do more and be more was always there. I had to drive and push myself into becoming the young lady I am today.

It was sometime during my primary school days when we were watching the Diamond Legue as a family. I vividly remember Usain Bolt winning first place for the umpteenth time and my aunt telling my mom that one day it would be me they would be seeing on the television screen. It was not what she said at that moment that caught my attention, it was her faith in me. Unfortunately I could not persue my athletic dream for long because of an injury. I had a knee dislocation whilst participating in the 100m hurdles at my school. My athletic 
dream was crushed. But it was then that I knew God had bigger plans for me. I decided to persue my academic career.
After a lot of hard work and effort, I managed to pass my grade 7 exams with flying colours. The proud faces around me said it all. I had done my part but I still had a long way to go. It was now my parents role to make sure I got enrolled into  a good reputable high school. And once again, they proved they they were going to be there every step of the way supporting me.
I went to Regina Mundi High School and it was the start of a good thing, or so I believed. I lost myself in the process, forgetting a was just an average kid from a poor family in the end midst of children of big company owners. It took me getting into the wrong class, or so I thought, to realise what was at stake. Luckily for me, my parents were as supportive as always and I aced my O level exams, including my extra subjects.

Up until now my life has been nothing short of a testimony. I managed to get a place at Mukaro High school in Gutu for my A level. It was not the best place to be but I had to soldier on. I always found it funny when our Headmistress would tell us during assembly to be dogba lions. She always said it was their hardworking nature she envied. Little did I know that I had to be one to excel. Luckily I realised that on time and I worked my way up once again. Giving in to the teenage pressures and fantasies was just not an option for me. I knew if I wanted to excel then I would have to ignore them. I aced my A level exams once again but the issue now was how to fit in in the normal teenage world. My academic stresses were behind me and it was up to me to be a good respectful human being in the society. As the African saying goes, "munhu munhu nokuda kwavanhu", I knew I had a lot in store for me. Working hard academically was not going to cut in this time. And it is at this stage in life where I need to do more. Will I make it this time around. <This message was edited>
09/03/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Received please!

Let me get it evaluated!
11/03/24, 8:27 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well.

I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
11/03/24, 9:44 am - +263 73 242 2020: Good morning. My parents are unavailable at the moment due to work situations
11/03/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I do understand, 

Since the discussion is for around 20 minutes itself,

Kindly take an update from them.
11/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 73 242 2020: OK, let me try
11/03/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Sure please.
11/03/24, 10:44 am - +263 73 242 2020: I talked to my mom and she's free for the next 20 minutes
11/03/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Could you please request her to acknowledge the same in the group?
11/03/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 242 2162: Am available for the next 20 minutes only.
11/03/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Dear parent, now that you have followed the entire discussion and the process,

Given the finances and the details of the program, are you willing to support your child both mentally and financially?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.
11/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 242 2162: My network is a bit poor. I have done the voice note but its not sending through. We are prepared and willing to support Tariro both financially and mentally
11/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
11/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: You see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
11/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
11/03/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
11/03/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 242 2162: definitely am willing to support her through the journey
11/03/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/03/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/03/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India
