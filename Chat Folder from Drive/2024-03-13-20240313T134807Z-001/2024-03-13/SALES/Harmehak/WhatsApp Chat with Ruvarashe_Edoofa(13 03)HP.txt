*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Ruvarashe Fortune Nyamakope. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
