08/03/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/03/24, 9:59 am - +27 65 271 9279: Good morning,, do you have any offices in Zimbabwe
08/03/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/03/24, 10:17 am - +27 65 271 9279: What are your requirements for someone to get the scholarship? Is it 100 percent funded?
08/03/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/03/24, 10:25 am - +27 65 271 9279: How long does it take, for you to respond, after applying for the scholarship?
08/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, we are currently in the discussion for the same itself.

Right now after receiving the application, we begin with the counseling session, whereby I will brief you about all the details following a thorough process.
08/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Did Tadiwanashe happen to brief you about her application through her friend Munyaradzi, who is a part of the program?
08/03/24, 10:28 am - +27 65 271 9279: She did
08/03/24, 10:28 am - +27 65 271 9279: Okay
08/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Great!
08/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: So far, have you been able to follow the shared information?

If so, now may I know your understanding of a 100% funded scholarship?
08/03/24, 10:32 am - +27 65 271 9279: It's an all funded scholarship.. All expenses paid.. From tuition, stationery, accommodation and flights
08/03/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/03/24, 10:44 am - +27 65 271 9279: Okay,, thanks for the clarifying
08/03/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
08/03/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Tadiwanashe!
08/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Good afternoon
08/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Am Tadiwanashe D Khasha. I am a lady aged 20 years old .l was born on the 26th of December 2003.

08/03/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, since the results have been out.

Didn't she happen to apply to other institutes as of yet?
08/03/24, 4:30 pm - +27 65 271 9279: She did apply,, but we were hoping she would get a scholarship,, because of our financial problems...
08/03/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

Where all did she apply?
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 65 271 9279: In Zimbabwe
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Local universities
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I am referring to the institutions.

For instance UZ, NUST, MSU.
08/03/24, 4:31 pm - +27 65 271 9279: MSU
08/03/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please and has she been accepted as well?
08/03/24, 4:33 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Yes,, she got accepted..
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - +27 65 271 9279: But because of financial issues,, she could not proceed
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/03/24, 4:50 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Yes  I agree
08/03/24, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, now given the finances are less than those in Zimbabwe along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.

08/03/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support for your child!
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - +27 65 271 9279: That will be a great opportunity for my daughter to further her studies
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Patricia, are you aware we are proudly associated with Glenview 1 high and we have students from the school in India as well?
08/03/24, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
08/03/24, 5:00 pm - +27 65 271 9279: M not aware,, I learned about it when I got a message from you,, so I asked my daughter,, she told me she applied

08/03/24, 5:02 pm - +27 65 271 9279: M so grateful for your association with Zimbabwe,, because a lot of students come from poor families,, just like my daughter
08/03/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: May I know more about her aspirations to study and become a Geomorphologist?
08/03/24, 5:03 pm - +27 65 271 9279: In my case,, I am a single parent,, so it's so hard for me to send her to university
08/03/24, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.

09/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.

09/03/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: The program provides 50-100% scholarship is on Tuition fee please.
09/03/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 973 2483: Ok l understand
09/03/24, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Alright Tadiwanashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 973 2483: In 5 years l see myself being successful as l would be an asset by adding value and if l get into Edoofa Program it will enable me to get more knowledge for l believe knowledge is power
09/03/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tadiwanashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/03/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 973 2483: First of all l would get to experience new culture, meet different groups of people have that experience of a life time and l get assurance that after finishing l get a job unlike here am uncertain whether l get the job

And l have always wanted to attend university abroad the feeling is just something else and India sounds phenomenal
09/03/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You see, Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 973 2483: Yes they are challenging
09/03/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

09/03/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you please,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
09/03/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 973 2483: No
09/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 973 2483: I see the difference
09/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Huge difference as compared with other country
09/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Countries
09/03/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Tadiwanashe.
09/03/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
09/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Can you please explain on the earn while you learn program
09/03/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Sure Tadiwanashe.
09/03/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/03/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 973 2483: This program sounds great
09/03/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Tadiwanashe!
09/03/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

09/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 973 2483: The earn while you learn program sounds wonderful
09/03/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tadiwanashe.
09/03/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/03/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Ohh really now that's exciting
09/03/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

I believe now you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tadiwanashe?
09/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Yes it's doing a tremendous job
09/03/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/03/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: The Opportunities you get reflect the job world of today's time.
09/03/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Ohh ok l see
09/03/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Yes are can see its uniqueness
09/03/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Great!

I shall also connect you and your mother with a parent who has two daughters currently in India in 20-30 minutes.
09/03/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
09/03/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Yes
09/03/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
09/03/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Something like $1500-$2250
09/03/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/03/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
09/03/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Ohh l see
09/03/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/03/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Indeed it is
09/03/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/03/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/03/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Ohh ok
09/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
09/03/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Yes l understand
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
09/03/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

09/03/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 973 2483: Thank you so much
09/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Do request Mrs Patricia to connect with Mrs Ruth as well.
09/03/24, 5:39 pm - +27 65 271 9279: Okay,, thank you..
10/03/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
10/03/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/03/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
