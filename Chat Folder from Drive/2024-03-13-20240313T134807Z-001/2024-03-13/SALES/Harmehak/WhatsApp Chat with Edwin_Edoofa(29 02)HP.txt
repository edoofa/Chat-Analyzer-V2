It was just a discussion I did not say that thus the program he wants. He will update about what he is  upto
05/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

In that case did you or Edwin ever happen to research about the requirements for these fields in Zimbabwe or India please?
05/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 666 6544: Yes we did here in Zimbabwe  , but this was a wish.

Can you please help us with programs you offer which suits his results please so that will discuss with him once he is reachable

However chemistry/physics are crucial requirements for both the fields.
05/03/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: And since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 666 6544: Well , so which programs do you offer that suits his results so that we start from there
05/03/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are

06/03/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Alright Edwin, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
06/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 638 0878: Well I'm seeing myself employed in an organization where l will be able to improve and contribute to the sector through research so that l will be able to detect and treat diseases affecting our lives. This will also help to fulfill my dreams of working for my personal upkeep and helping the surrounding community and country at large
06/03/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: That is really great Edwin, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 638 0878: I have realized that I can get exposure of new technologies abroad, since most drugs are coming from outside especially in developed  and emerging countries
06/03/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Edwin.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
06/03/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 638 0878: Indian education system is one of the best in terms of the health sector and advanced technology. I have seen several drugs from India which are being used in most hospitals, pharmacy and Chemistry
06/03/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: That's correct!

06/03/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Edwin?
06/03/24, 11:31 am - +263 71 638 0878: I'm on it
06/03/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 71 638 0878: I'm done now
06/03/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: I am glad , Edwin!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/03/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 638 0878: No
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 638 0878: Well, noted with thanks
06/03/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: In simple words Edwin, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition.
06/03/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
06/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 71 638 0878: It will be good if l get the Earn while you learn program to take my fees further down for my parents to afford the remaining balance
06/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please and we will discuss the same in detail!

However what is your take on the higher quantum of scholarship as well, Edwin?
06/03/24, 12:05 pm - +263 71 638 0878: I will also work hard to qualify for quantum of scholarship
06/03/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Thats good!
06/03/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Edwin, Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
06/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 638 0878: While it is true about the  fees, on the cost of leaving we end up developing strategies that make our life easy as long we get the education. Basic necessities like, accommodation,  internet and traveling,  we end up making ways to reduce those costs, and it's not a once off payment. Things like fees we pay per semester while time is moving you will be sourcing other funds for the next semester,  l hope you can notice the difference. Most we opt for basic needs than luxurious to get our education complete.
06/03/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand that, Edwin!

However that doesn't reduce the cost that one eventually spends, isn't it?

While you definitely pay it over time however the basic costs including everything is nothing less than $3000-3500 for quality education!
06/03/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 638 0878: Where lm now is deep in rural areas, no electricity, wd use solar and battery energy, poor network connection,  we walk a distance to get better network for Internet connection.  I can only get updates from my  sister who is in town. So my mobile phone is about to ran out of power.  I don't know if it will take me through the conversation
06/03/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Edwin!

By when would you get back after charging your device?
06/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 71 638 0878: Yes it can end up suming between $3 000- $3 500 altogether
06/03/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Correct!

I believe now you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?
06/03/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
06/03/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 638 0878: We can continue for now untiljt switches off,  or you can send me the questions so that l can respond to them when lm at home with adequate access to power and give you once if l got internet access
06/03/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
06/03/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Along with an opportunity like the *Earn While You Learn Program*.
06/03/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 638 0878: It's very clear and true
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/03/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/03/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Sure Edwin!

Along with the same once you are unavailable, your father or sister can continue and conclude the discussion.
06/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 638 0878: It's ok fine my sister will get back to you. Have a good day. I pray everything goes well
06/03/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

Meanwhile you can go through the shared resources!
06/03/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to follow, Ms Ethel and Edwin?
06/03/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
06/03/24, 10:22 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Thank you
06/03/24, 11:38 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Sorry for inconveniences made, we are facing network and power challenges .We will talk tomorrow
07/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 666 6544: I have understood that will be good and very affordable
07/03/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 666 6544: Yes we have followed
07/03/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

Excuse me for the delay due to an emergency.

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
07/03/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 638 0878: Yes we can start
07/03/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: I do understand.
07/03/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 666 6544: Indeed l can see. It's worth appreciation.  I would be glad to get that opportunity too
07/03/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you have been following
07/03/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 666 6544: My pleasure
07/03/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Ms Ethel, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
07/03/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 666 6544: Yes
07/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Ms Ethel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
07/03/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 666 6544: $1 500_$2 250
07/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/03/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 666 6544: I hear you,  l can see
07/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Yes it's affordable, thank you
07/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
07/03/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Yes
07/03/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/03/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/03/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
07/03/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 666 6544: It's not a problem , well noted
07/03/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Well its okay,  it's flexible
07/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 666 6544: We are able to do that
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement.
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 666 6544: You are welcome
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
07/03/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?

07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/03/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

07/03/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

I hope l got everyone well in the group.

I'm Edwin's cousin brother. My name is Ariel

We heard about the Edoofa program. With all the information l got from the discussions,  we have agreed to proceed with the program. We have agreed to everything so far and we are keen and interested. The mother and father might not have time to be with us now as they are busy at work. But l think Edwin and Ethel will be there. However as a family we agreed to proceed
08/03/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Good day Mr Ariel.

How are you doing today?
08/03/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Have you all already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

Agricultural activities in the least developed countries have been characterized by low yields. The use of fertilizers is still very modest and production techniques are primitive. The whole area under irrigation represents less than one-tenth of the total arable land used, while the remainder is dependent on rainfall.

Major constraints to increased agricultural output in the developing world are the unavailability of adequate land and a lack of incentives for farmers to produce more. In many developing countries, small farmers produce the basic food crops; and it is not possible to increase food production significantly without giving them priority in the distribution of land, water, credit, fertilizers, energy and other production inputs.

Many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. Besides being blessed with huge land and good fertile soils there have been years of no rainfall leading to drought and crop failure.

African countries have been lagging behind in terms of technology for several years. They do not afford modern agricultural practices such as use of machinery in Agriculture. The cost of buying inputs, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides have become a major challenge. They also do not have capital to build dams and buying  center pivots so that they can irrigate crops when there is no rainfall. 

Food insecurity in Africa is also due to ever growing population. There is high birth rate and population increase leading to an increase in terms of food demand but farms are not producing.  In most African countries, they only practice subsistence agriculture with surplus being sold but very few farms are able to produce surplus because of their sizes and poor management. Since there is no surplus kept in storage facilities, if there is poor yield in a single year the whole country will be affected by hunger and poor diets.

Most African countries especially in the SADC region, there have been continued dry spells induced by El_nino.  It is very difficult to cultivate crops without irrigation in such conditions. Crops  requires a lot moisture content when they are under the heat wave to keep them health.  In some regions crops are being affected with several pests and diseases and thereby reducing the yield. This have made  most African countries to be under food security threat and sometimes seeking donations from other countries.

There is need for quick intervention in terms of controlling pests and diseases so as to get better yield. Locusts, birds and wild animals are increasingly affecting crop yields in African countries. This is because of shortage of food in their reserved areas. They end up leaving the game parks to search for food in people's fields. There is also a need to control them if African countries have to produce good crop.

The lack of know how in terms of crop production have led to inefficiency in crop production.  There is also lack of knowledge in terms of good farming practices and farm management. It is advisable to grow drought resistance crops such as soughum and small grains in low rainfall receiving areas.

Education on good agricultural practices and advantages of good crop management need to be taught in schools and to farmers. There is also need for support to African farmers in terms of access to farming equipment and certified seeds to make their farms get a better yield. This will help in providing adequate food with a balanced diet in the country.

In many rural areas, even with plentiful rainfall, dependence on subsistence farming has resulted in only short-range agricultural planning.

With existing traditional farming methods, it is difficult to meet family food requirements. Continuous soil erosion, limited means of fertilization, inadequately cultivated fields, and uncontrolled grazing practices all work to create minimally-productive farmland. Farmers tend to have little experience in poultry-keeping or in mechanized farming methods because of the inaccessibility of training centres where they might learn modern farming methods.

My Inspirational story 
In my life I never give up easily even in hard times because the is a story that my friend' grandfather Mr Chuma used to tell us about his life which inspire me.

My friend's grandfather was born in a poor family and raised by a single parent.Mr Chuma was raised with his mother they survived through vending. Mr Chuma struggled to go to his primary school even things were hard.

Everyday school day was hard to Mr Chuma because he went to school without eating anything. They only survived with one meal per day. He went to school with bare foot old wearing old uniforms. Other school children used to lough to him and bullied to him daily.

Mr Chuma always give thanks to his mommy because she was always by his side.The mother struggled much In vending to set things together even to pay his school fees. 

Mr Chuma passed his Primary level and proceeded to secondary level.Mr Chuma then received the presidential scholarship which helped him to proceed with school and he managed to pass both Ordinary and Advanced level.His dream was to become a Lawyer and he always chased his dream. 

Mr Chuma then received another scholarship from South Africa and proceeded with University. After his graduation he also got a job opportunity there in South Africa and from that time his life began to change. 

A good thing, Mr Chuma had never forgotten his mother which was his life saver.Her mother is also proud of him too because no crying no in her life and the life of vending Is no longer In their family. 

From this story that Mr Chuma used to tell us of his lifestyle,I will never give on my life too.This story always initiates me and always gives me strength in hard times 

This is only but a few about my Inspirational story
08/03/24, 4:42 pm - +263 71 638 0878: Thank you
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received,

Let me get it evaluated!
08/03/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Edwin, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
08/03/24, 6:56 pm - +263 77 666 6544: Parents might be online but for Edwin l doubt his phone is now off
08/03/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

By when shall I expect to hear from Mr Jivas in that case?
08/03/24, 7:06 pm - +263 77 666 6544: I think he will be online soon afterwork.  I think before 08:00 pm
08/03/24, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/03/24, 9:29 pm - +27 71 819 3740: Good evening,my phone was off and there was no power,I'm sorry for that
09/03/24, 7:54 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Jivas!

I do understand please.
09/03/24, 7:55 am - Harmehak: Shall we proceed with the discussion now?
09/03/24, 7:55 am - +27 71 819 3740: Yes
09/03/24, 7:56 am - +27 71 819 3740: How are you
09/03/24, 7:57 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, thank you!
09/03/24, 7:57 am - Harmehak: Mr Jivas, now that you have followed the entire discussion and the process,

Given the finances and the details of the program, are you willing to support your child both mentally and financially?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.

09/03/24, 8:01 am - Harmehak: You see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
09/03/24, 8:01 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
09/03/24, 8:01 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
09/03/24, 8:05 am - +27 71 819 3740: Yes please
09/03/24, 8:06 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/03/24, 8:06 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/03/24, 8:06 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/03/24, 8:06 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 8:08 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 16th or 17th March 2024 for $200 and the 16th or 17th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 16th or 17th March 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/03/24, 8:18 am - +27 71 819 3740: I will be ready for April whilst I'm still waiting for my salary
