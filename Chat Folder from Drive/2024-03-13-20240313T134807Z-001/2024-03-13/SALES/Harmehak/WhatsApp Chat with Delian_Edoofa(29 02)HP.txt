06/03/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 293 5761: That she is okay with it and can pay whatever the scholarship is not offering
06/03/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Delian!

I believe you must have followed that the program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee itself?
06/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/03/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
06/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I don't have my o level results at hand but i am doing maths physics and chemistry and I want to study medicine because i love helping people

What all did you research regarding the requirements for Medicine?
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 293 5761: An A in A level chemistry maths ans either physics or biology is that right
06/03/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

Correct those are requirements in Zimbabwe with three A levels in the subjects.

However, what is your take on the importance of pursuing Biology if you wish to pursue Medicine!

Considering both Biology and medicine are all about Living beings and Humans!
06/03/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I think i can just start biology once again when i get to university
06/03/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/03/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Okay so what aspect in engineering are you offering
06/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
06/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Along with the engineering degrees.
06/03/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Okay
06/03/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: What made you opt for Physics instead, Delian?
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 293 5761: For me it was easier than biology
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the discussion so far, Delian?
06/03/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I have a chance
06/03/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate, Delian?

06/03/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: We are discussing the same itself Delian.

However right now I would like to hear your thoughts on the degree you would like to pursue.
06/03/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I think it is as good as medicine according to what i have heard though now i will be helping people indirectly

07/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Earlier you said if i can do any of the prgrams you mentioned i can go on to pursue medicine
07/03/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I shared regarding Medical Laboratory Technology please.
07/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Oh okay then i will just pursue a career in Pharmacy
07/03/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Surely Delian!
07/03/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Delian, if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
07/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I can get better education than i could have here in my country and lessen the burden in my family. It will also provide better job opportunities around the world for me.
07/03/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: You see, Delian, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
07/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Yes they are very challenging becaise one can get a degree and never get the chance to use it because there are very few job opportunities here
07/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Delian.
07/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: However, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Delian.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
07/03/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I have heard that studying anything related to medicine in India is great because it is one of the best countries when it comes to medical education and it would create vats opportunities all around the world. I heard when it comes to medicine, India is better than every other country
07/03/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Delian!
07/03/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

07/03/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Delian.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 293 5761: No
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
07/03/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Oh oj
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Ok
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/03/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Oh ok
07/03/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
07/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 293 5761: It is very good
07/03/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
07/03/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Delian, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
07/03/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I do
07/03/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright, Delian!

Now comparing the costs I believe you must be in an even better place that how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
07/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Yes I think it is very helpful
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/03/24, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

07/03/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 293 5761: This is great
07/03/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
07/03/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 5:23 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I got it
07/03/24, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, 

Delian, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
07/03/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
08/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/03/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: @263772432179 

Are we connected?
08/03/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/03/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
09/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Delian I have been expecting to hear from you since Thursday,

May I know what happened?
09/03/24, 6:38 pm - +263 78 293 5761: I had no internet connection
09/03/24, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Do you have enough data now, Delian?
09/03/24, 7:20 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
10/03/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon Delian!

How are you doing today?
10/03/24, 6:05 pm - +263 78 293 5761: Im fine how are you
11/03/24, 8:26 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please.
11/03/24, 8:26 am - Harmehak: Are we good to proceed ahead with our discussion now, Delian?
11/03/24, 8:38 am - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
11/03/24, 8:38 am - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
11/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
11/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Delian as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
11/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/03/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 293 5761: 1500 to 2250
11/03/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/03/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/03/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 293 5761: Thank you
11/03/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Delian, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/03/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 293 5761: I do
11/03/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/03/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/03/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 293 5761: Oh okay
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
11/03/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 293 5761: I understand
11/03/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow, Delian?
11/03/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 293 5761: Yes
11/03/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
11/03/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 293 5761: Oh so this makes it easy for me right
11/03/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
11/03/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

11/03/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 15 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
11/03/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 293 5761: Alright
11/03/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Dear parent and Delian,
