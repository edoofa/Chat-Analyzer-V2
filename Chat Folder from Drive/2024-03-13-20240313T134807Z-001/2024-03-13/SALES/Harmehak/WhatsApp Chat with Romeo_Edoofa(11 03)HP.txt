12/03/24, 11:13 am - +27 78 977 5407: Good day, this is Ms Nyathi, Romeo's mother, thanks kindly for giving my son an opportunity to be helped by you. <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Its a pleasure to connect with you!
12/03/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Romeo, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/03/24, 11:40 am - +27 78 367 9466: I studied  in Dlamini High School in Tsholotsho. I was paying 116 dollars a term. I wrote my O level in 2021 and got 3A and 2Bs in 5 subjects  ......I before that, I failed to write my o level by the year 2020 because  my parents were struggling  to make money during the pandemic 
So I failed  to write  the June exams and only  attended the November  session , that's  when I passed combined science, mathematics and commerce 
Moving forward, I then wrote my ALevel exams in the year 2023, which is last year and got 14 points  out of 15 ....... my combination  was crop science, geography and statistics 
I am very strong in academics , calcutions and science mostly.....  my biggest  strength is hope I never give up on my dreams and I keep  in mind that  tough times don't  last tough people do <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 11:42 am - +27 78 367 9466: My parents  are separated...... my father  is a handyman, and my mom was unemployed since the Corona pandemic..... now she is an street vendor
12/03/24, 11:46 am - +27 78 367 9466: May biggest  weakness is social skills,  I have some sort of insecurity, which  hinders may social development 
I am not a fan of big crowds  as well ..... I guess I am claustrophobic in some way
12/03/24, 11:47 am - +27 78 367 9466: I have four siblings  and I am a second  born
12/03/24, 11:49 am - +27 78 367 9466: My mother's highest  level of education   is an Advanced International Diploma in Marketing with L.C.C.I

12/03/24, 12:19 pm - +27 78 367 9466: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 12:21 pm - +27 78 367 9466: I got this picture from my learning portal
12/03/24, 12:21 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Exam portal am sorry
12/03/24, 12:22 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Unfortunately my o level zimsec portal is failing  to open
12/03/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Great results!
12/03/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
12/03/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: You can share them later.
12/03/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: So since the results are out, did you happen to apply to any other institutions as well please?
12/03/24, 12:28 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Okay  thanks for the generosity maam
12/03/24, 12:33 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Yes I did but the tuition  was way too high  for .y parents  to pay ..... I started  searching  for scholarships  
I tried to apply  in crimson, parul, noida, various Chinese universities , Japan,  Malaysia 
I failed  because the application  needs passport  as an ID document  and I didn't  have an passport  so that hindered me.
12/03/24, 12:36 pm - +27 78 367 9466: I tried  in more than 40 universities..... I was hunting for scholarships  in Google  ......most of them never replied  ..but those who replied  were offering  50% scholarships, with an remaining tuition  fee that  my Parents hardly  make in a period  of six months
12/03/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Romeo!
12/03/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: May I know the fee please?
12/03/24, 12:48 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Approximately 3600 for indian universities including  accommodation 
Malaysia was 5340 in average and they only offer 20% scholarship
China never responded
12/03/24, 12:52 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Some needed  application fee so that your  application  can be processed..... I feared that I might  make my short  and results  in my parents  losing  money that could  have been useful, these days there a tonnes of scams on internet. Hence I was afraid
12/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, what you are sharing, Romeo!
12/03/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: So what are your financial preparations for your higher education?
12/03/24, 1:09 pm - +27 78 367 9466: My parents were not prepared, my dad lost everything during the Covid period so he has been struggling for jobs ..... we can only spare 1077 dollars for preparations ...... under very tight conditions
12/03/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Romeo.
12/03/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Romeo, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/03/24, 1:44 pm - +27 78 367 9466: It is true, ma'am, it is the reason  why I failed to enroll in zimbabwe  ...... it is even merely  impossible to make that much money in zimbabwe
12/03/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Romeo.

Meanwhile let me share a document with you for your better clarity.
12/03/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 2:13 pm - +27 78 367 9466: I have read the document but I have not yet finished  I understand  that the seats  are limited  and they are allocated  to best deserving students and many more 
I will partake in the earn as you learn and many other projects, even manual work if I get admitted  as long as I am learning  I will do every as you please........
12/03/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Kindly take your time to read it properly.
12/03/24, 2:22 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Okay  ma'am
12/03/24, 3:06 pm - +27 78 367 9466: I am done Ms Harmehak
12/03/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
12/03/24, 3:26 pm - +27 78 367 9466: I understood that Edoofa is educational program  that focuses on helping  the unfortunate  talented students from all over Africa. The program  is not a charity  program  hence it selects the students who have qualities  that meets their demands 
It was born by Anhad Edutrains solution pvt. In the year 2009 
 There are six procedures  that  needs to  be followed  unordered for one to attain  this scholarship  and stages include 
Personal counseling 
Eligibility check test 
Admission to Edoofa etc 
The program has  over 2000 seats in different campus that  the organization operates at.
The organization  discourages learning  in countries  like USA because  the costs  of living is extra high as well as the tuition  fees 

Edoofa  offers the earn as you learn programs that  gives you a chance to reduce the tuition  fees though engaging  in various  projects  like digital  marketing etc
12/03/24, 3:30 pm - +27 78 367 9466: After passing  the first  three program  you have to pay the enrollment fee...... for  you to become a fellow  Edoofian 
The program helps  you in attaining  scholarships which helps  you by  50-100% scholarships 
Which might reduce  the tuition fee to become somewhere in a range of 2000-3000 usd per year
12/03/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly read the document, Romeo.
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: So far would you like to ask anything?
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Edoofa works  with you up until you finish  your course  they provide  mentor counselors which work with you through the course 
Edoofa  is the second family , a home far from home
12/03/24, 3:35 pm - +27 78 367 9466: No ma'am  I will  go through  the document  once more so that I can understand  what I have missed for now I think I am satisfied
12/03/24, 3:36 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Except  for the tuition  fee do I pay it once for the whole year
12/03/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure Romeo!
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your effort!

Do discuss the same with your parents as well!
12/03/24, 4:14 pm - +27 78 367 9466: They were following  as well  they say every thing  is okay
12/03/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
12/03/24, 4:18 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Okay  ma'am ....... is there anything else I need to know
12/03/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/03/24, 4:52 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Please pardon me , I didn't  understand  your question  they must be an mistake
12/03/24, 4:55 pm - +27 78 367 9466: We think that  the costs  are reasonable and we are going  to take the offer
12/03/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Which mistake are you referring to please?
12/03/24, 4:55 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Is the tuition  fee paid  all in once for the whole year
12/03/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/03/24, 5:03 pm - +27 78 367 9466: Okay  ma'am  I am satisfied about  everything....... as well as my parents  they are all satisfied 
Thanks to you 😊
12/03/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
12/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
12/03/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

12/03/24, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
