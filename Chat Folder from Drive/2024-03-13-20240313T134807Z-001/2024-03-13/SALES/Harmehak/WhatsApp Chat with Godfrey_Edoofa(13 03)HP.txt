12/03/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening,

*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Godfrey Gonye. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
