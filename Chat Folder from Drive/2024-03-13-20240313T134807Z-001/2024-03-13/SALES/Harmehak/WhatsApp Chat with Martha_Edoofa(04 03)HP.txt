It's fees are also affordable and they ranges from 2000 to 3000 per year if not mistaken when given a 50% scholarship. Edoofa only pays the tuition fee while the student will pay for the accommodation and food fees.
11/03/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Martha, let me share more about the program with you.

11/03/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 779 9372: Well noted!
11/03/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Martha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Domboramwari High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
11/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 77 779 9372: Okay

Allow me to introduce myself to you Ms. Harmehak. My name is Martha Mwaengeni. I am turning 20 this year. I have completed my Advanced level and I have managed to do 11 points with an A in Computer Science, C in Pure Mathematics and also a C in Business Studies.I used to pay 85 USD at Domboramwari High.

I have always wished to do Computer Science since that's where my passion is and also knowing that we are now living in the world full of new technologies, this has boosted my passion for Computer Science.

When it comes to strengths, I am  someone who is perseverance. I do not give up so easily because I know where I came from to reach out to this stage. I also put my all when it comes to my studies because I do understand that opportunity comes at once.

I like to play Netball and basketball. I also like to read novels during my leisure time and listening to motivational speakers so as to understand more about life and how they earn their living.

I come from a disadvantaged background which is a polygamous family with twenty-four children. Unfortunately my father is no longer with us and I'm left with my mother who is not gainfully employed.

I have encountered a lot of obstacles when it comes to my educational fees. Luckily I have had an opportunity to have a loving uncle who despite being a handicapped person, selflessly paid for my primary level fees. I'm also grateful to mention that my Ordinary level fees where graciously paid by the program called CAMFED which is mainly for girls who are having difficulties in paying their fees. I maintained a good academic record and managed  to obtain better grades in various subjects. 

After completing my Ordinary level, there was a challenge to continue with my studies due to lack of finance. However, my sister, who, despite being a widow with three sons of her own and also working as a house maid , selflessly paid for my Advanced level fees because she saw the potential that I have when it comes to education. 

However, she is not able to continue to pay for my tertiary level fees due to lack of income. She didn't have the opportunity to go to school due to the policy of Johani marange church, but she always strive for me so that I will be able to be the game changer of my family and also to change the whole story of early child marriages. 

I'm the first sibling of my family who have had the opportunity to go to school and reach this level since all of my sisters they were married at early ages.
