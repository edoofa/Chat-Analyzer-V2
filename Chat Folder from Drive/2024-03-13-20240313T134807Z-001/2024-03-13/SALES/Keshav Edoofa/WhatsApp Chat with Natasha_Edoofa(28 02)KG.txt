29/02/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me explain you about Edoofa scholarship program <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
29/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 812 1367: Okay Mr Keshav
29/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 812 1367: Thank you
29/02/24, 10:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/02/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 812 1367: Yes it is true
29/02/24, 10:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263788121367 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
29/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 812 1367: Noted sir
29/02/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Natasha\, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 812 1367: Ok...
29/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 812 1367: My name is Natasha Ngwenya,a girl aged 19 born on  27 January 2005.  I am very thrilled to apply for an Undergraduate Degree in Medicine and Surgery.

Iam well aware that the Edoofa Scholarship offer great opportunities for young people like myself. It gives us, the country's youths a great chance to study in the most renowned Universities and allows us to fly our national flag high and better the continent as a whole. Opportunities like this are beyond  imagination for most youths like myself and would be a dream realised. It is no secret that the students from Zimbabwe that have had this opportunity and studied in India , have immensely made national contributions, and I would also want the honour bestowed by the Edoofa Scholarship.  I strongly believe that the scholarship will propel me to great heights and become a reputed  Surgeon.

I was born and bred in the small sugarcane town of Chiredzi , in the eastern-lowveld region of Zimbabwe. I have lived most of my life in the gloomy neighborhood of Tshovani township, a place not very conducive for big dreams. Squalor and poverty in my neighborhood has limited access for most to a fair education and thwarted their dreams. I have however, kept my hopes alive in this small town , where big dreams are shunned and success stories are less.   

I was born illegitimate, the result of a  relationship between my unknowing mother and a married man. My mother was treated like an outcast in the small community , my father denied to be responsible for my upkeep and until today I use my mother's maiden surname. My mother gave birth to me at a time when she already had a six- year old son from a previous abusive marriage. She got married again,  four years after my birth and entered yet another  marriage that produced my other two-half brothers. 

We were left to live with our maternal grandmother and we struggled economically. Although my mother secured a job with the Ministry of Agriculture , she could barely cater for all of us and her failing health. Our maternal uncle's death also saw his daughter falling under my mother's care and it worsened the situation. My mother's salary barely catered for all of us and the pension my grandmother gets could not make things easier. Despite the situation both the strong women who raised me, hoped from our loan shark to another and navigated through credits and many foreclosure attempts of our grandmother's house that has been used as loan collateral for as long as I can remember. This has afforded me the opportunity to attend fairly good schools . I did my primary education at Chiredzi Government primary school, where I attained seven units .I proceeded to Mount Selinda High School where I passed my ordinary level with 7As,4Bs and 1C. This feat was a result of serious sacrifice from my family and my elder half-brother, who is my greatest cheer leader. One last loan , that threatened to end my mother's life due to my A' level examination fees stresses , my older brother's university fees and tuition fees for the other three children under her care, saw me struggling with studying and passing my A' level with twenty points. I distinctively excelled in Pure Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Statistics.


I am not very active in sports , but I have over the years been involved with the debate team, the school choir and child rights advocacy clubs at the schools I attended. This has given me a unique opportunity to enhance my social intelligence, learn teamwork and leadership skills.In my community I have been an active member of Coalition Against Child Labour in Zimbabwe (CACLAZ) , a nonprofit organisation that fights against the abuse of children and focuses on  the reintegration of former child labourers into schools. I have also been involved in the period poverty fight and the sexual and reproductive health  rights (SRHR) campaigns for the girl child. My brother's child advocacy as a journalist has been a big influence on me. In my final Advanced level year I was made a senior prefect and this furthered my responsibility and servant- leadership skills. 

My passion for helping others and the need to positively impact the world and show the authenticity of African persons , drives me. I believe the Edoofa Scholarship is the missing catalyst to realising this dream. The knowledge and skills I could get through this scholarship would create a real difference for me , my family and  my community. For I believe mine is a bigger destiny and shall be the story of a community medical hero, a patriot and above all , an inspiration to a generation after me.

02/03/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 812 1367: different reasons why  I  chose to study medicine. First of all I am  motivated by the desire to help others and make a positive impact on the world. I am also drawn to the intellectual challenge of learning about the human body and how to treat disease. And I also have a passion for science and want to use the knowledge I aquire to improve the lives of others.i think tha these are the most important reasons why I chose medicine
02/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care

04/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 812 1367: You're welcome Mr Keshav...
04/03/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand your passion for studying a medical course here in India
04/03/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
04/03/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*. Bachelors in Optometry*
*. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

Also *BSc Cardiovascular Technology* 
*B.Sc. Biology* and *B.Sc. Nursing*

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
04/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 812 1367: May I please ask if you offer a degree in bio-medical science?
04/03/24, 1:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We do offer biomedical engineering but it requires a subject combination of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics at A level, hence you are not eleigible for it
04/03/24, 1:56 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Ok Mr Keshav....So may I please ask what Optometry is?
04/03/24, 1:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Although we do offer courses like BSc. Biochemistry, BSc. Microbiology and Bachelors in Pharmacy!
04/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Oh I think I might be interested in Bachelors in Pharmacy
04/03/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So shall I explain you about the course in depth?
04/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes please....
04/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* is a 4 year undergraduate program which is compulsory for anyone who wants to practice as a pharmacist. B. Pharmacy is study of preparing and conferring drugs and medicines for a number of illnesses and deficiencies.

04/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kindly go through the course layout, read it carefully and get back to me once done!
04/03/24, 2:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you understand the course @263788121367 ?
04/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes I did...and I think I might enjoy it
04/03/24, 2:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/03/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 812 1367: If I were to pursue a career in pharmacy, I would hope to be able to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the health and well-being of people around the world. Edoofa's program could help me achieve this goal by providing me with the resources and support I need to succeed in my studies and in my career. Five years after completing the program, I hope to be working as a pharmacist and helping people every day.
04/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 812 1367: As a pharmacist, I would be able to help people in a number of ways. I could provide them with the medications they need to stay healthy, and I could also educate them about their medications and how to use them safely and effectively. In addition, I could provide advice on how to live a healthy lifestyle and prevent disease. I could also conduct research to develop new medications and treatments that could improve people's health and quality of life. And I could advocate for policies that would improve access to healthcare and make it more affordable.
04/03/24, 2:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Natasha, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also, I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Thanks for the kind words, Mr Keshav I'm glad you're interested in my reasons for wanting to study abroad. I think that studying abroad would provide me with a number of advantages, including access to world-class education, exposure to different cultures, and the opportunity to network with people from all over the world. Additionally, studying abroad could give me the chance to improve my language skills and gain a better understanding of the world. I think all of these benefits would help me become a better pharmacist and make a bigger impact on the world.

04/03/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 812 1367: That is very impressive
04/03/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I would like to know if I will be offered a job in India after completing my studies
04/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 812 1367: And also does it mean that I can never be able to become a doctor if I study in India?
04/03/24, 3:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see @263788121367 in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners that provide students with good paying jobs!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
04/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It does not mean you won't be able to pursue medicine after your studies here in India, once you complete a certain course that will open a plethora of opportunities and you can look out for further study options, studying In India will give you the exposure of medical and its entrance examinations too and you will be able to make an informed decision!
04/03/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 812 1367: That is very great to hear....so Mr Keshav will I be able to visit home once in a while?
04/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Ok...thank you I am relieved....
04/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Natasha there is no restrictions on the movement of students to their home country
04/03/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Ok...then I would love to get a chance to study in India through an Edoofa program
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that
04/03/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we shall move ahead
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/03/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Ok...noted ...thank you
04/03/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words @263788121367 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/03/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Okay thank you...is it possible to start the Earn While You Learn program in the first year?
04/03/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The moment you get enrolled in the Edoofa family your EWYL program gets started and you can right away start to earn your scholarship credits and reduce your annual fee before even getting started with your academic year which is from August 2024
04/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 812 1367: That is good news...
04/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Thank you
04/03/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263788121367
04/03/24, 3:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/03/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes thank you
04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/03/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I think this will definitely help me as well as my mother
04/03/24, 4:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Natasha, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - +263 78 812 1367: That's very affordable...thank you
04/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/03/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes it is something I have been looking for... thank you
04/03/24, 4:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
04/03/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I will be doing a lot of projects then
04/03/24, 4:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
04/03/24, 4:46 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Thank you...I look forward to that
04/03/24, 4:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before I explain you the next aspect of the program, I need you to see the pictures and videos of the recent visit of the Edoofa team to Harare, Zimbabwe to interact with students and parents!

04/03/24, 4:50 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Okay thank you... the videos are still downloading
04/03/24, 4:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Natasha
04/03/24, 4:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Natasha, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/03/24, 5:00 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes..
04/03/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Natasha as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 78 812 1367: $1500-$2250
04/03/24, 5:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Natasha, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/03/24, 5:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/03/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Noted thank you
04/03/24, 5:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/03/24, 5:08 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I also think so
04/03/24, 5:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great Natasha, I am delighted to hear that!
04/03/24, 5:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 5:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
04/03/24, 5:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Natasha, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 5:13 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Noted thank you.....
04/03/24, 5:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
04/03/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes I have understood that
04/03/24, 5:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
04/03/24, 5:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
04/03/24, 5:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:20 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Okay Sir
04/03/24, 5:29 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I've watched it....and it's quite inspiring
04/03/24, 5:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great to know Natasha
04/03/24, 5:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle
04/03/24, 5:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 5:33 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Noted thank you Sir
04/03/24, 5:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Natasha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/03/24, 5:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 5:36 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Yes....so is Step 2 is done in Zimbabwe itself?
04/03/24, 5:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes thats correct it will be after your scholarship test is evaluated that will be tomorrow itself
04/03/24, 5:38 pm - +263 78 812 1367: Will it be done online?
04/03/24, 5:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes it will be online Natasha
04/03/24, 5:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 5:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 5:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 5:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

05/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 812 1367: When tragedy strikes, too many stories crop out.One such tragedy is about the Rwandan genocide and its aftermath. 

In 1994, there was a genocide in Rwanda, where members of the Hutu ethnic group targeted and killed an estimated 800,000 people from the Tutsi ethnic group. The genocide was sparked by tensions that had been brewing for decades between the two ethnic groups, and it was fueled by propaganda and hate speech from political leaders. The genocide had a devastating effect on the country, destroying families and communities, and leading to a massive displacement of people. In the aftermath of the genocide, the country has worked hard to rebuild and has made some impressive progress.

One of the biggest challenges that Rwanda faced after the genocide was rebuilding trust between the different ethnic groups. There was a lot of anger and resentment, and it was difficult for people to live and work together. The government implemented a series of policies known as "reconciliation," which aimed to help people forgive and heal from the trauma of the genocide. These policies included truth and reconciliation commissions, community service programs, and the creation of a national holiday to commemorate the genocide. While these efforts have had some success, it is still an ongoing process. Another major challenge has been dealing with the economic devastation caused by the genocide.

Many people lost their homes and livelihoods, and the country's infrastructure was severely damaged. In addition, the massive displacement of people caused a lot of economic instability. However, Rwanda has made some impressive progress in this area. The government has focused on economic development, and there has been a lot of investment in infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals, and schools. This has helped to create jobs and improve people's living standards. Overall, life in Rwanda is slowly improving, but it is still a long road to recovery.

 Another major issue that has emerged in post-genocide Rwanda is gender inequality. Before the genocide, women had a strong role in Rwandan society, and many women lost their husbands and other family members during the genocide. Afterward, many women were left with the responsibility of caring for their families on their own. The government has made a concerted effort to address this issue, and they have introduced policies that promote women's rights and equality. However, there is still a long way to go, and many women still face challenges such as domestic violence and sexual abuse. 

One final issue that has been a major challenge for Rwanda is the issue of justice. After the genocide, there was a massive backlog of genocide-related cases in the courts, and it was difficult to get justice for the victims. To help address this issue, the government created the Gacaca court system. These courts were designed to deal specifically with genocide-related cases, and they were run by community members, rather than professional judges. While the Gacaca courts were criticized for being unfair and biased, they did help to reduce the backlog of cases and allowed many victims to get some form of justice.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda is still a work in progress. The country has made some impressive strides since the genocide, including economic development, infrastructure improvements, and gender equality initiatives. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as access to justice and dealing with the lingering trauma of the genocide. Despite these challenges, the people of Rwanda are resilient and determined to rebuild their country and create a better future for themselves and their children.

 "Do you think there is any hope for lasting peace in Rwanda?" This is the question that remains with us.
05/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 812 1367: I look at myself in the mirror and try to think about who I am and what I will be in the future.Each time I see myself as a better version of who I am today.I know I have a story to tell but I do not really see why anyone would want to hear it.

I am an average girl.I have never been married to or abused by a celebrity and that makes me quite invisible to the world as a whole.I am a 19 year old girl and I was born illegitement and this has been to my greatest disadvantage.I was a victim of social stigmatization but still that did not stop me from dreaming.

I have lived my whole life in the small sugarcane town of Chiredzi where no one dare dares to dream.Like puppets the strings of poverty have always held us back.


It is located in the small eastern-lowveld region of Zimbabwe. I have lived most of my life in the gloomy neighborhood of Tshovani township, a place not very conducive for big dreams. Squalor and poverty in my neighborhood has limited access for most to a fair education and thwarted their dreams. I have however, kept my hopes alive in this small town , where big dreams are shunned and success stories are less.   

Having been born illegitimate like I mentioned before, the result of a  relationship between my unknowing mother and a married man. My mother was treated like an outcast in the small community , my father denied to be responsible for my upkeep and until today I use my mother's maiden surname. My mother gave birth to me at a time when she already had a six- year old son from a previous abusive marriage. She got married again,  four years after my birth and entered yet another  marriage that produced my other two-half brothers. 

We were left to live with our maternal grandmother and we struggled economically. Although my mother secured a job with the Ministry of Agriculture , she could barely cater for all of us and her failing health. Our maternal uncle's death also saw his daughter falling under my mother's care and it worsened the situation. My mother's salary barely catered for all of us and the pension my grandmother gets could not make things easier. Despite the situation both the strong women who raised me, hoped from our loan shark to another and navigated through credits and many foreclosure attempts of our grandmother's house that has been used as loan collateral for as long as I can remember. This has afforded me the opportunity to attend fairly good schools . I did my primary education at Chiredzi Government primary school, where I attained seven units .I proceeded to Mount Selinda High School where I passed my ordinary level with 7As,4Bs and 1C. This feat was a result of serious sacrifice from my family and my elder half-brother, who is my greatest cheer leader. One last loan , that threatened to end my mother's life due to my A' level examination fees stresses , my older brother's university fees and tuition fees for the other three children under her care, saw me struggling with studying and passing my A' level with twenty points. I distinctively excelled in Pure Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Statistics.


I am not very active in sports , but I have over the years been involved with the debate team, the school choir and child rights advocacy clubs at the schools I attended. This has given me a unique opportunity to enhance my social intelligence, learn teamwork and leadership skills.In my community I have been an active member of Coalition Against Child Labour in Zimbabwe (CACLAZ) , a nonprofit organisation that fights against the abuse of children and focuses on  the reintegration of former child labourers into schools. I have also been involved in the period poverty fight and the sexual and reproductive health  rights (SRHR) campaigns for the girl child. My brother's child advocacy as a journalist has been a big influence on me. In my final Advanced level year I was made a senior prefect and this furthered my responsibility and servant- leadership skills. 

My passion for helping others and the need to positively impact the world and show the authenticity of African persons , drives me. I believe the Edoofa Scholarship is the missing catalyst to realising this dream. The knowledge and skills I could get through this scholarship would create a real difference for me , my family and  my community. For I believe mine is a bigger destiny and shall be the story of a community medical hero, a patriot and above all , an inspiration to a generation after me.

I believe that my story needs to be told.

05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773779342 @263779325643 
I hope you are in good health
05/03/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Farai and Mrs. Memory , you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
05/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 932 5643: We are well thank you
05/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 77 932 5643: Yes sir we are
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 377 9342: Yes we fully support
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Mrs. Memory and Mr. Farai
05/03/24, 2:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
