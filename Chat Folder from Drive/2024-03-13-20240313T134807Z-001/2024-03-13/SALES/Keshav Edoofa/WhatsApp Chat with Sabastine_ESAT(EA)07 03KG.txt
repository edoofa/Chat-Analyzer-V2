11/03/24, 12:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 597 8207: Yes sir
11/03/24, 12:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Sabastine, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 597 8207: Oky I understand
11/03/24, 12:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Sabastine, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
11/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 597 8207: My name is Sabastine Shuga aged 23 just finished a shot course in electrical power engineering in Harare at Quandaline institute of engineering I did my A level at Mutambara High school in Chimanimani district and I proceeded with my education to A level in Mutare Manicaland province. I figured that I am more into calculations and practicals so Electrical and electronic engineering is currently my field calculating power, current series and parallel circuits, capacitance Kirchhoff, superposition and more and my weakness is that I am a slow learner when it comes to reading and cramming words. I also like to play soccer and darts
