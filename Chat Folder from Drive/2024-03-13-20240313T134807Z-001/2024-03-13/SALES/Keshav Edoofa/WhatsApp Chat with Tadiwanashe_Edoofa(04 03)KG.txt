We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Tanaka.

04/03/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 292 3071: Yes boss
04/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about Edoofa scholarship program, please!
04/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

04/03/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
04/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 292 3071: Okay thanks I'm interested
04/03/24, 11:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it? @263714387223
04/03/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 292 3071: Not but Tadiwanashe because he is my son to study with you

04/03/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/03/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Okay sir

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/03/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 292 3071: I'm satisfied with everything so how do I be considered as one of your student
08/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me share those details with you ahead
08/03/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then now,
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>

09/03/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263772923071 @263773163935 @263714387223 
Shall we resume our discussion, please?
09/03/24, 7:15 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Sorry today were not using phone because we were at church till 5:30 pm so sorry for late response
11/03/24, 11:17 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263773163935 @263772923071 @263714387223 
How are you, please?
11/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Sorry was very busy with meetings because every Monday
11/03/24, 1:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263714387223 are you available to continue?
11/03/24, 1:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263772923071 Shall we continue with you?
11/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Yes sir
11/03/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then Mr. Elisha!
11/03/24, 2:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood about the course cost aspect!
11/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Yes I understand everything and I am in agreement
11/03/24, 2:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tadiwanashe and Mr. Elisha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/03/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 292 3071: So we would appreciate if we can also considered in that lower price class
11/03/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It requires you to be active and responsive throughout the session for better evaluation of your application and I believe you will be able to make up for it!
11/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Maybe if we can continue tomorrow today is not good for me because is a Monday
11/03/24, 3:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mr. Elisha
11/03/24, 4:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care
Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
11/03/24, 5:04 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Thank you
12/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well
As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/03/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 292 3071: It's fine we can start
12/03/24, 10:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the EWYL program?
12/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 292 3071: Sure
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

12/03/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Yes I will benefit obviously from what I read I can see my future bright
12/03/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Mr. Elisha, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/03/24, 4:34 pm - +263 77 292 3071: I can manage the annual fee
12/03/24, 4:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/03/24, 4:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 292 3071: Certainly yes that's what I was dreaming for
12/03/24, 4:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
12/03/24, 7:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
