13/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 463 8508: I understood  that Edoofa is concerned  with our success  and its giving us the opportunity  to meet with entrepreneurs who can teach us skills so that they will recruite us when we graduate
13/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
13/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
13/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
13/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

19/02/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Moreblessing
19/02/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have some clarity regarding our Edoofa scholarship program?
19/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 463 8508: Yes yes
19/02/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes it's true
19/02/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Moreblessing, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
19/02/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
20/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 463 8508: I am an enterprising woman of 22 and I am seeking financial  assistance for higher education  learning. This is because since 2021when I finished A Level my parents  haven't been able to raise fees for further education because they are not formally employed.I am passionate about community  engagement and development and I am pursuing studies in Social Work ,an education which can put me in a position to help people to overcome  obstacles and cope with life challenges  such as poverty,discrimination and drug addiction.

21/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 463 8508: I believe that Social Workers act as the voice of the marginalized  groups  in society,they help those who are struggling to meet their basic human needs .
So I want to partake in this and create a society where everyone is being catered  for and I also want to listen  attentively to the concerns  of the marginalized  groups.
22/02/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263784638508 @263776364936 
Good morning to you
How are you please, shall we resume our discussion?
22/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 463 8508: Good morning
22/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 463 8508: Yes
22/02/24, 10:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I appreciate your thoughts @263784638508
22/02/24, 10:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see @263784638508 , being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.

Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work 

Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.

So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
22/02/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 463 8508: Ohhh l see 
Yah I once heard that they are similar
22/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
22/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 463 8508: Yes that will be good
22/02/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs.

27/02/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Moreblessing I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also, I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Studying abroad is a valuable opportunity for many students who want to enhance their skills. Some of the reasons why I want to study abroad and not in my country are:

- Cultural exchang Studying abroad allows me to interact with people from different backgrounds and cultures. This can enrich my personal and academic growth, as well as foster mutual understanding and respect among diverse groups. I can also learn a new language, explore a new place, and experience a different way of life.
 Resources -Studying abroad can expose me to more  resources for learning and research. I can access world-class facilities, libraries, laboratories, and professors  that are not   in my country.
 Studying abroad can also help me develop a global mindset.
27/02/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I can totally understand and resonate with your thoughts Moreblessing
27/02/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?
27/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Uum I'm not sure
27/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

27/02/24, 4:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
27/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I understand 
No I don't have anything  to ask so far
27/02/24, 4:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

God Bless You!

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
27/02/24, 4:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 8:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
28/02/24, 8:29 am - +263 78 463 8508: Good morning 
Yes let's start
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: In that case lets proceed ahead!
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 9:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 463 8508: Okay I understand
28/02/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Moreblessing what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 463 8508: Alright  that's good
So you do not offer  100% scholarship ?
28/02/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: We do offer 100% scholarship as well but it depends upon a lot of factor from grades, academic background, personality traits, willingness to learn, participation in the counseling session etc
28/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: But we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship to every student who passes all the eligibility check stages!
28/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 1:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response @263784638508
28/02/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
29/02/24, 9:20 am - +263 78 463 8508: Good morning

29/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I did
29/02/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 463 8508: Yes please
29/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
29/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes it will
29/02/24, 1:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that @263784638508 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available @263784638508?
29/02/24, 4:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Saturday at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

I hope you are doing well?

04/03/24, 1:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright I understand the network challenges but I would like to ask you Moreblessing, are you serious about the opportunity?
04/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I am serious

04/03/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes
04/03/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are able to understand the benefits and how the EWYL program works!
04/03/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I understand
04/03/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize this means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
04/03/24, 5:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

06/03/24, 11:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you sum up what you were able to learn about the EWYL program, please?
06/03/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 463 8508: It's a program  that allows you to pay your tuition fee, accommodation and food whilst learning .This is done through online projects so in other words they earn scholarship  credits  making education  affordable
06/03/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great @263784638508

06/03/24, 11:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/03/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 463 8508: $3000 really ?wow this is nice it's a good program  
Yes it's something  that I have been looking for
06/03/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to see you excited for the program @263784638508
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we proceed ahead!
06/03/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I need you to see the pictures and videos of the recent visit of the Edoofa team to Harare, Zimbabwe to interact with students and parents!

06/03/24, 12:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you see the pictures and the videos please?
06/03/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I did
06/03/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I believe you wish to be a part of such events being one of Edoofa's Family right?
06/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes
06/03/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Wonderful @263784638508
06/03/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263784638508 @263776287282 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Yes I'm ready
06/03/24, 1:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263784638508 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 463 8508: About $1 500- $2 250
06/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 463 8508: For 5 universities
06/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly,and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Okay so I'm supposed  to pay $350?
06/03/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See @263784638508 Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/03/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 463 8508: I think so
06/03/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However @263784638508 as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 463 8508: Alright  so how do we pay?
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain you about it further!
06/03/24, 2:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
06/03/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263776287282 Shall we continue the discussion if Moreblessing is unavailable?
06/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>

The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
