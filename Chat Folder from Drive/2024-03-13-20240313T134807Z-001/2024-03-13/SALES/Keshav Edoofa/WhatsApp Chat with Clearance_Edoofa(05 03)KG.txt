05/03/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so i shall brief you all regarding the Edoofa scholarship program!
05/03/24, 10:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/03/24, 10:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 10:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

05/03/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 71 567 0353: Yes it is ..for sure
05/03/24, 11:10 am - +263 71 567 0353: I really need to be part of highly educated students through edoofa

05/03/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263715670353 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/03/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: In your case it is the guardians

05/03/24, 1:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright in that case we shall move ahead!
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yes sir
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 257 4799: Great. Am following
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Owky is this already under a scholarship or its not yet calculated under a scholarship
05/03/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Clearance, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year after the scholarship, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Oky that's great sir I get it now
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall brief you about the *Earn While You Learn Program.*?
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yes sir
05/03/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
05/03/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/03/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

05/03/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yeah this is really beneficial sir
05/03/24, 1:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Clearance, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/03/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yeah I'm willing to work hard there is nothing I need more that persuing my dream and this is the chance I have to do whatever it takes
05/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 567 0353: So is this all sir
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Excellent spirit @263715670353 !
05/03/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/03/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/03/24, 2:53 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Thats exactly what I've been looking for sir
05/03/24, 2:54 pm - +263 71 567 0353: I would be happy if you take me in
05/03/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize the EWYL program, the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
05/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 567 0353: That's great I'm in
05/03/24, 2:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we proceed ahead!
05/03/24, 2:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I need you to see the pictures and videos of the recent visit of the Edoofa team to Harare, Zimbabwe to interact with students and parents!

05/03/24, 2:58 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Wow I guess it was so fabulous
05/03/24, 2:58 pm - +263 71 567 0353: I just saw them all
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Indeed It was, we interacted with so many parents and students @263715670353
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 567 0353: I see so when is the intake
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Intake will be in August 2024
05/03/24, 3:01 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Oky does that mean I'm in sir
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you the process ahead now!
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263715670353 basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yes sir
05/03/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Clearance as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 567 0353: 1500
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly @263715670353 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/03/24, 3:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Oky great it's affordable sir
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 567 0353: That's good sir edoofa has great operations
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am happy to help you @263715670353
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However @263715670353 !, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Sounds flexible I'm sure they'll like it
05/03/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well @263715670353 , however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
05/03/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yes sir I got it
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am happy you could understand our program benefits!
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
05/03/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:35 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Sir do you wanna make my heart melt with curiosity🔥😂
05/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 567 0353: This is really great I would like to be part of it🔥
05/03/24, 3:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am happy to see you excited to join the Edoofa program!
05/03/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 567 0353: My pleasure🤭
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared
05/03/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 567 0353: So I'm now waiting for stage 2
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Yes sir I get it
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/03/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Oky sir noted
05/03/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Owww that's nice sure
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope @263714021898 @263772574799 do you wish to get clarified on any aspect?
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Not really if I have any questions I'll ask you
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure you can anytime, please
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Thanks sir
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide.


It's been over two decades since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, in which about thousands of  people were killed in just a few days. In the years since, the country has been on a long and difficult journey of recovery and reconciliation. Life in Rwanda today is still a far cry from the horrors of the genocide, but it remains a country that is still healing from the scars of the past.
On a day-to-day level, life in Rwanda is stable and relatively peaceful. The economy has seen significant growth, since then. They are not even getting distracted with the pain of the genocide but they are taking it as a pillar of them to strive for the best.and erase the scars . As for now Rwanda is regarded as one of the most peaceful countries in the world as it is rising economically and peacefully, despite the hidden scars. Everything is set back to normal people are no longer living in fear for the past sixteen years which is really a great thing .other countries are even looking forward into joining deals with Rwanda so that trade and economic growth become friends of different nations. Hospitals have got back to their Normal operations than the horror times and also distorted buildings have regained their beauty and this brings a wow to Rwanda no one thought that life in Rwanda could be so amazing to date. But we're glad it's relatively adorable .well I've discovered that even tourists are getting attracted with the mighty Rwanda and they set their feet each and every day in Rwanda, it's becoming a place of wonders as they are currently overcoming the scars of the genocide. As the essay folds I would wanna appreciate the residents of Rwanda for not giving up on themselves, and becoming the most adorable nation of wonders.

06/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 567 0353: Well they'll be online soon and let you know

06/03/24, 11:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: In that case can she communicate with me and answer few of my questions through your device?
06/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 71 567 0353: Oky there you go
06/03/24, 11:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Mrs Tarisai, how are you please?
06/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 71 567 0353: We're good Mr Keshav how are you
06/03/24, 11:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am very well and quite impressed with Clearance as a student!
06/03/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 567 0353: Well that's great news
06/03/24, 11:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Mrs. Tarisai can you answer few of my questions please?
06/03/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 567 0353: Ok
06/03/24, 11:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mrs. Tarisai you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
06/03/24, 11:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/03/24, 11:26 am - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
06/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 71 567 0353: We're really Willing sir
06/03/24, 11:31 am - +263 71 567 0353: We also need the best for him
06/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 71 567 0353: So roughly how much do we need for the whole process until he gets there can you partition it for us with titles sir
06/03/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am not able to understand what are you trying to ask me Mrs. Tarisai, can you elaborate a bit please?
06/03/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: That i great but can you acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?

06/03/24, 1:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Clearance do update me when they are available, please!
06/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 567 0353: Oky sir
06/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

07/03/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

11/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 567 0353: Oky sir
11/03/24, 10:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know when your parents and guardians will be available please?

11/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 257 4799: Good day Sir
11/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 567 0353: @918920482888 sir
11/03/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Would anyone like to ask regarding the letter of acceptance, please?
11/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 567 0353: As we chose option 1 after paying 200 will the hunt for a seat begin
11/03/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 257 4799: Thank you very much for enrolling our son at your institution.  Everything detailed in the letter was clear.  We are now making arrangements to pay as outlined
11/03/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
Or shall i explain you both the methods?
11/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 567 0353: Explain both sir
11/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 257 4799: Would prefer the local one
11/03/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
11/03/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: There is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
11/03/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
