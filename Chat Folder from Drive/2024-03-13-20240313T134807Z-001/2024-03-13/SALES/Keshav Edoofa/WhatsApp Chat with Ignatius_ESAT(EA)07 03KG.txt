If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/03/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well
As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 979 6494: Yes we can now start the session
12/03/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
12/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 979 6494: Yes we have gone through the brochures and flyers
12/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 979 6494: It's legitimacy is obvious
12/03/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Ignatius and @263715565283 @263714657790 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/03/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 979 6494: Yes l think l can match up to the standards
12/03/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Ignatius, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
