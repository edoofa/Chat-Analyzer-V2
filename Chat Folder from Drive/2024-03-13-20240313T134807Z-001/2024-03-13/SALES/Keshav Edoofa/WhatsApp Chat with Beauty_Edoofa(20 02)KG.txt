As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
28/02/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
29/02/24, 9:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good morning @263714293705

29/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 71 429 3705: My network is poor and it is tripping
29/02/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to know if you are serious for this opportunity as there are very less seats and a large pool of students applying! <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 429 3705: For the mean time our finances are not intact I may do this next year
29/02/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Are you planning to study in Zimbabwe itself?
29/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 71 429 3705: Not in Zimbabwe i want to study there in India
29/02/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know how then will you plan to try it for next year as well?
29/02/24, 4:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Saturday at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/03/24, 5:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
