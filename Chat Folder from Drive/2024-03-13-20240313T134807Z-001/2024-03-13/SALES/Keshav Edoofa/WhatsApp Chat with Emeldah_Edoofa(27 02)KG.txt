28/02/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
28/02/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/02/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

28/02/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
28/02/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 5990397: Thank you for enlightening us
28/02/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/02/24, 10:22 am - +260 97 5990397: Yes
28/02/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thats great!
28/02/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright as we start your sesison now, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

28/02/24, 11:32 am - +260 96 1691711: Especially when given a 100percent bursary
28/02/24, 11:34 am - +260 96 1691711: Because am just a general worker in the local authority
28/02/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/02/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
28/02/24, 11:37 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
28/02/24, 11:42 am - +260 96 1691711: Sir l don't know more of currency differences  so I need guidance
28/02/24, 11:44 am - +260 96 1691711: What l need a good education for my daughter
28/02/24, 11:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Avg cost of education in India is 1,80,000 Kwacha which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 7,00,000-7,50,000 Kwacha , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 50,000-60,000 Kwacha per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
28/02/24, 11:57 am - +260 96 1691711: My net  per anum is only 50 000 and I have another child at university here in zambia then l don't know how you may help me
28/02/24, 12:00 pm - +260 96 1691711: And another child is in boarding school here at siavonga boarding school
28/02/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 12:05 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav that can really help me  because l alone can't manage
28/02/24, 12:08 pm - +260 96 1691711: I really want my daughter to study in india though l have financial constraints I will be trying
28/02/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I have @260975990397 be online to join in, please?
28/02/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 5990397: I am online

28/02/24, 1:30 pm - +260 97 5990397: Because it has always been my passion to be an engineer and so that I  emerge as an independent contractor and create Job opportunities
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is amazing to know
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So shall i brief you about the course? <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 1:33 pm - +260 97 5990397: Yes please
28/02/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
28/02/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kindly go through the course layout, read it carefully and get back to me once done!
28/02/24, 2:08 pm - +260 97 5990397: Understood. I want to know more about the Stellar GPA
28/02/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: GPA means grade point average it is a nomenclature for marks and grades here in Indian universities!
28/02/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood!
28/02/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: ?
28/02/24, 2:18 pm - +260 97 5990397: Thanks Mr Keshav.
28/02/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/02/24, 2:33 pm - +260 97 5990397: With the knowledge that I will acquire. I will do my best to add value to the engineering career and further my education
28/02/24, 2:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great @260975990397 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/02/24, 2:44 pm - +260 97 5990397: Because I feel the quality of education is different and better  and the opportunities for work are broad. And lecturers are the best and students always come out the best.
28/02/24, 4:10 pm - +260 96 1691711: This is my gross per annum my net per annum is 43
28/02/24, 4:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain you the cost now!
29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/02/24, 10:28 am - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav
29/02/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: Did you understood about the cost aspect now?
29/02/24, 10:35 am - +260 96 1691711: Yes am trying to understand
29/02/24, 10:37 am - +260 96 1691711: What else are the requirements that she is supposed to put in place If she will be accepted
29/02/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words @260961691711 @260975990397 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 10:39 am - +260 96 1691711: Thank you Mr keshav am following
29/02/24, 10:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall i explain * Earn While You Learn Program.* now?

29/02/24, 10:41 am - +260 97 5990397: Yes
29/02/24, 10:42 am - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav
29/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
29/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

29/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

29/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/02/24, 10:48 am - +260 96 1691711: Very much mr keshav
29/02/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that @260961691711 , moving further now if I have to help you @260961691711 @260975990397 explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 10:53 am - +260 97 5990397: Understood Mr Keshav
29/02/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/02/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/02/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 5990397: In my own understanding earn while you learn calls for a student to work hard in order to achieve their goals
29/02/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly @260975990397
29/02/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: This means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
29/02/24, 11:01 am - +260 97 5990397: This is really a relief Mr Keshav.
29/02/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
29/02/24, 11:13 am - +260 96 1691711: Sure mr keshav
29/02/24, 11:21 am - +260 97 5990397: Yes it is Mr Keshav.
29/02/24, 11:22 am - +260 97 5990397: Thank you
29/02/24, 11:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 11:49 am - +260 97 5990397: Yes Mr keshav
29/02/24, 11:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: @260975990397 @260961691711 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/02/24, 12:03 pm - +260 97 5990397: $1500-2250$
29/02/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly @260961691711 @260975990397 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/02/24, 12:13 pm - +260 97 5990397: Alright
29/02/24, 12:14 pm - +260 97 5990397: Which round am I supposed to follow
29/02/24, 12:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Round 6 only @260975990397 as for you enrollment fee will only be 350$
29/02/24, 12:19 pm - +260 97 5990397: Alright Mr keshav but isn't it that the dateline for round 6 today?
29/02/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we will be concluding the counseling session today and moving ahead to your interview stage by tomorrow you are still considered for the privilege of 350$ benefit
29/02/24, 12:24 pm - +260 97 5990397: Okay Mr keshav
29/02/24, 12:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so? @260975990397 @260961691711
29/02/24, 12:28 pm - +260 96 1691711: Mr keshav we need more assistance please
29/02/24, 12:31 pm - +260 96 1691711: Otherwise my dream for my daughter to study abroad will be shattered
29/02/24, 12:32 pm - +260 97 5990397: Yes.... It is a bit lighter
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I can provide assistance only in the payment policy
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall share the same with you!
29/02/24, 12:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/02/24, 12:35 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes, share mr keshav
29/02/24, 12:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However @260961691711 @260975990397 , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 12:41 pm - +260 96 1691711: Thanks Mr keshav
29/02/24, 12:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope this was helpful Mrs. Annie?
29/02/24, 12:42 pm - +260 96 1691711: So to my little calculations application fee is at 8050 kwacha
29/02/24, 12:42 pm - +260 96 1691711: That's roughly
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes thats correct @260961691711
29/02/24, 12:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So are you willing to support your child for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so that Emeldah can have a very successful future ahead and do wonders?
29/02/24, 12:45 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes I will try by all means
29/02/24, 12:46 pm - +260 96 1691711: That's if you allow us to pay in instalments upto 30 days
29/02/24, 12:46 pm - +260 96 1691711: Or within 30days
29/02/24, 12:47 pm - +260 96 1691711: For the application
29/02/24, 1:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/02/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As i explained you, you can surely pay in installments that is 200$ in 7 days and the remaining amount of 150$ the next month!
29/02/24, 1:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Also I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
29/02/24, 1:36 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav
29/02/24, 1:51 pm - +260 96 1691711: Mr keshav how can we pay in case we have money eg account number
29/02/24, 2:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain you those details further!
29/02/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained, i would like you to come online, please? @260961691711 @260975990397
29/02/24, 2:44 pm - +260 96 1691711: Am online mr keshav
29/02/24, 2:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we finish the session, i would like you to see this video!
29/02/24, 2:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:48 pm - +260 97 5990397: Am also online
29/02/24, 2:48 pm - +260 96 1691711: This is nice, mr keshav
29/02/24, 2:50 pm - +260 96 1691711: When students come that side they are moulded and have adventure at the same time
29/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly, we believe in all-round development of our students so they can become future leaders!
29/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
29/02/24, 2:51 pm - +260 96 1691711: Exactly
29/02/24, 2:51 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes
29/02/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:52 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr k. Am following
29/02/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mrs. Annie, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
29/02/24, 2:53 pm - +260 96 1691711: I have  followed
29/02/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes sir, for now we are still in step 1
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - +260 97 5990397: Yes
29/02/24, 2:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes thats correct Mrs. Annie
29/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
29/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 3:03 pm - +260 96 1691711: Okay..
29/02/24, 3:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

04/03/24, 1:35 pm - +260 97 5990397: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile, I get your answers evaluated may I have @260961691711 you to answer a few of my questions?
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - +260 97 5990397: Give me time to type it
04/03/24, 1:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its okay Emeldah this will work
04/03/24, 1:40 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes Mr. Keshav
04/03/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Annie @260961691711 , you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
04/03/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
04/03/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
04/03/24, 1:46 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes mr keshav
04/03/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great to hear that @260961691711 
I am glad you as a parent are keeping track of your child's future opportunity that awaits for her to get her able to be successful ahead

Also, I really appreciate your efforts and support for your child's education, you are awesome, Kudos!
04/03/24, 1:53 pm - +260 96 1691711: Like in my case mr keshav our parents died along time around 2000 and they left us jobless being one of the oldest child  l went for adult education so that l can make a different in our lives .My siblings also have followed suit taking themselves to school as for now I can count on one who is sharon to help me and also the input that Emeldah will be puting in during her study l know she will not disappoint me neither edoofa because she is hardworking
04/03/24, 1:54 pm - +260 96 1691711: Thank you Mr keshav

06/03/24, 1:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure I will share the details with you!
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See Mrs. Annie the course of Emeldah is Btech which is Bachelor of Technology and she will be admitted to one particular university that she chooses after different universities send her the admission letter through guided by our admissions team!
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is affiliated with 250+ Universities, And all the 250+ Universities are UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) approved meaning the student after completion of the course can work anywhere in the globe.
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: - Lovely Professional University 
- Uttrakhand Technical University
- Punjab Technical University
- Galgotias University 
- Gulzar Group of Institutions
There are various other universities, as well as the list, goes on and on
06/03/24, 1:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope that clears your concern!
06/03/24, 1:37 pm - +260 96 1691711: Ok I understand
06/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great then!
06/03/24, 1:38 pm - +260 96 1691711: Alright mr keshav
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now I shall explain you about the payment method!
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes please
06/03/24, 1:43 pm - +260 96 1691711: Yes because am short with the first payment so l needed some time
06/03/24, 1:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know till when I can expect you to complete the first part of the payment, please?
06/03/24, 1:51 pm - +260 96 1691711: Within next week
06/03/24, 1:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mrs. Annie I shall share the details now and I hope you will be able to complete the payment before 12th March!
06/03/24, 1:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zambia

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
Or shall i explain you both the methods?
06/03/24, 1:55 pm - +260 96 1691711: Explain both please
06/03/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge. 

The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.
06/03/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-
