*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Shantelle.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Yes I'm Karen
18/01/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Karen,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav, and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
18/01/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so Karen, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Shantelle, is that correct?
18/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
18/01/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Shantelle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Shantelle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 383 1195: The purpose of the Edoofa scholarships is to provide support and resources to individuals who may face barriers to entering the financial services industry. These scholarships are designed to help level the playing field for individuals who come from diverse backgrounds, and to encourage them to pursue careers in finance. By providing financial support and mentorship opportunities, the edoofa scholarships aim to help individuals achieve their career goals .
18/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Very well Karen, now let further elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

19/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
19/01/24, 8:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Karen
19/01/24, 8:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: As we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/01/24, 8:48 am - +263 78 383 1195: Okay

31/01/24, 12:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Accounts as a subject would not be required to pursue  *B.Com Accountancy*

31/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
31/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
31/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

31/01/24, 1:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
31/01/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Karen what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
31/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
31/01/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So i hope you are clear till now, would you like to ask something?
31/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Good afternoon how are you doing? Are there any other B. Com (Hons) degrees she can do besides Accountancy  degree
31/01/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Simon , yes she can pursue *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* without specialization in Accountancy
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Can I have a short list of the other degrees.
31/01/24, 2:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See Mr. Simon we looking at the student subjects, interests and eligibility recommend the courses that are the best for them, Looking at Karen's interest and subjetcs the most suitable degree for her to pursue will be B.com!
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However if you would like to look at the diferent courses we offer, i shall suggest you through the brochure of the Edoofa scholarship program
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall send it to you for your convienience
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 295 1770: OK thank you very much
31/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: shall i brief you about the EWYL program to you now?
31/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Yes you can
31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

31/01/24, 2:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
31/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 295 1770: I think it will definitely benefit my child

So shall we continue with your session?
02/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes

I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT TIME* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

06/02/24, 10:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Karen and Mr. Simon , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
06/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 383 1195: Okay we may start
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you got to know about the EWYL program?
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: Would you like to ask something thus far?
06/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes thank you
06/02/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Karen, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 383 1195: How can I earn accordingly
06/02/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain to you about that
06/02/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/02/24, 4:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/02/24, 8:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Karen and Mr. Simon, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
07/02/24, 8:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263783831195 @263772951770
07/02/24, 8:28 am - +263 78 383 1195: Good morning
07/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with your session Karen?
07/02/24, 8:31 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
07/02/24, 8:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am hoping you are well-versed with all the aspects of our prestigious EWYL program!?
Also with the benefits it brings along?
07/02/24, 8:33 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
07/02/24, 8:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/02/24, 8:37 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
07/02/24, 8:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Karen as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/02/24, 8:42 am - +263 78 383 1195: About $2250
07/02/24, 8:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Karen, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/02/24, 8:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/02/24, 8:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
07/02/24, 8:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
07/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/02/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Karen basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/02/24, 1:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Karen, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
07/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Karen, and from your response it seems that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
07/02/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
07/02/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Karen as we are on the last stage of counseling before your eligibility check I would like to brief you about the Edoofa cycle
07/02/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Karen, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
07/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
07/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
07/02/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you available to finish your counseling session @263783831195
08/02/24, 8:36 am - +263 78 383 1195: Morning
08/02/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Morning Karen, how are you?
08/02/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 383 1195: Im good and you
08/02/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Karen
08/02/24, 9:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are clear till the 5th step of Edoofa cycle?
08/02/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
08/02/24, 9:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
08/02/24, 9:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/02/24, 9:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
08/02/24, 10:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope Mr. Simon @263772951770 you are keeping a follow-up on your child's counseling session!?
08/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 383 1195: No
08/02/24, 10:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: And @263772951770 ?
08/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 295 1770: Good morning. Yes I am following everything.
08/02/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

12/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Suppose her fees is $4 000 and she has a 50% scholarship is the balance of 2 000 suppose to be paid in full or we can pay in installments?
12/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will share the summarized version of all the financial aspect Mr. Simon
12/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall share all the financial aspects with you in a comprehensive manner again with you and all the assistance included in it!
12/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee
12/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 295 1770: OK thank you very much
12/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are very clear about the finacial aspects involved now Mr. Simon
12/02/24, 3:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Are you willing to support her to the fullest?
12/02/24, 3:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As Karen's counselor I want to help her and guide her to secure maximum scholarship for her education and so she could do wonders ahead! <This message was edited>
12/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Yes I am willing to support her education. Thank you very much and continue to support her. I hope she will get the highest scholarship
12/02/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will make sure in supporting her i guide her to achieve maximum scholarship!
12/02/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now i want to ask you some questions as you are clear about every aspect of the progarm!
12/02/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which Karen would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would Karen be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee Karen will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If Karen is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving Karen offer letter from the University, you will have to pay registration fee in order to finalize  university selection and reserve her scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in Karen first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of Karen first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/02/24, 6:29 pm - +263 77 295 1770: (1) B. Com. Honours in Risk Management 
(2) India 
(3) $6 000- $8 000 per year 
(4) $2 000- $3 000 per year 
(5) $350 enrollment fee 
(6) 7 days or you can pay $200 within 7 days and pay the balance of $150 within 30 days 
(7) Yes 
Sorry for replying you late I had run out of data
13/02/24, 8:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Simon @263772951770

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

14/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 295 1770: OK you can ask me
14/02/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Simon, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT <This message was edited>
14/02/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
14/02/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
14/02/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Yes I am willing to support her
19/02/24, 8:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263772951770 @263783831195
19/02/24, 8:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: Sorry for the delayed response, please
19/02/24, 8:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: I had some challenges with my device
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with your application, please?
19/02/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

21/02/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 383 1195: Yes
21/02/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you and @263772951770 know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th of February 2024 for $200 and the 27th or 28th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th of February 2024

Which one would you and @263772951770 like to opt for, and are financially prepared for the same?

The exact percentage of the scholarship will be informed once you get enrolled in the program and start your EWYL journey with the admissions team 

The admissions team will guide you and apply on your behalf to various universities and once you get an admission letter from one or more universities there will be mentioned the exact scholarship you will be receiving!
29/02/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response @263783831195 @263772951770
29/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Afternoon
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Afternoon Karen i want you both to be online for the next five minutes so I can explain you the payment methods, please?
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 383 1195: Okay
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263772951770 ?
29/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Good afternoon
29/02/24, 1:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263783831195 @263772951770 , so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
Or shall i explain you both the methods?
29/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 295 1770: If possible you can explain both methods
29/02/24, 1:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Mr. Simon
29/02/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Simon @263772951770 @263783831195 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end. <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: There is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
29/02/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

29/02/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 295 1770: OK thank you very much. I think second option is better
29/02/24, 1:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then you can proceed with the second method Mr. Simon
29/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 295 1770: Thanks

I was expecting your response, please!
04/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 295 1770: Good morning Sir how are this morning? I was expecting someone to lend me some money for her registration but he is now saying he has failed to get the cash. I am also trying to raise money for her final examinations which are due in November. The closing date for the exams is 19 March. I am now between a rock and a hard place. I don't know what to do now. I still want my daughter to study in India. I am sorry I wasn't able to what was expected of me. Once again I am sorry.
04/03/24, 10:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: I duly understand what are you trying to convey Mr. Simon but I would like to know how much part of the enrollment fee are you able to raise by now?
04/03/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 295 1770: Right now I don't have any money but one of my kids had promised me $50 if that other person had given me the money he had promised
04/03/24, 1:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then how are you planning to proceed further with your child's education then?
05/03/24, 7:01 am - +263 77 295 1770: Good morning how are you? Right now I don't know what to do but I still want my daughter to go to university. I still want her to go to India. Is it possible for her to apply next her and then go to university that year 2025?
05/03/24, 7:02 am - +263 77 295 1770: Yesterday I had run out of data that's why I wasn't able to reply you
05/03/24, 8:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263772951770 
How are you, please?
05/03/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 295 1770: I am fine just wondering where I can get some cash
05/03/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall tell you Mr. Simon, Karen being admitted this year only can reduce her fee as much as she can by putting in the hard work just right after being enrolled in the program as you know through the EWYL program so the burden of further studies will be off by your shoulders
It is only upon you to make Karen's future bright by getting her such a prestigious opportunity in her hands so that she can get successful ahead

I also would like to share this with you that we already have a limited number of seats left for our program in this intake and the enrollment fee offer of 350$ will be depleting soon as well and the earlier amount of 750$ will be in place again so I do not want you or Karen to miss this chance to grab her a seat in the program and get the highest quality of education at the most affordable cost compared to anyone elsewhere!
06/03/24, 8:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good morning @263783831195 @263772951770 
Hope you are in good health!
