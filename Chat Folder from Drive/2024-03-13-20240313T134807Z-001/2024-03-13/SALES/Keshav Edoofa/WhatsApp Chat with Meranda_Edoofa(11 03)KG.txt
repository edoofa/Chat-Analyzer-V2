*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Abide

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
11/03/24, 5:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/03/24, 6:06 pm - +263 71 133 9568: Tomorrow I'll be at school from 6:30 to 4:30
12/03/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well
As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/03/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 032 3343: Look I don't mean to disrespect you people, why's it that your group doesn't have any other students who are sending application for the scholarship other than MERANDA
12/03/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I don't get what you wish to convey Mrs. Tracy, may you elaborate a bit please?
12/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 032 3343: Never mind
