I am Keshav, Career counselor at Edoofa.

We have received your application under the prestigious ESAT Edoofa Scholastic Assessment Exam conducted in Harare from 17th February to 20th February 2024.

I hope I have contacted the right person!

I request you to add your Parents and Guardians so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.
08/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 069 9562: Good morning, how are you. Before we proceed I would like to be clear of the situation first. If I were to get a 100% scholarship, do I still have to pay 1500 or so per year? Also do I get to know the value of the scholarship before enrollment into the program?
08/03/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Tafara
08/03/24, 11:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: i would like you add your Parents and Guardians first in the group, please!
08/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 069 9562: I am very sorry to say this but it seems my financial situation is not stable enough to get me into this program so I'll have to back out. I'm really sorry for wasting your time🙏🏽.
11/03/24, 9:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know the challenges you are facing, please?
11/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 069 9562: Inability to pay the fees in the required timeframe
11/03/24, 10:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would get a better clarity after your discussion with your parents, please!
11/03/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 069 9562: Ok. I'm bringing in my Father then. He's the only parent

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 72/100*

Congratulations for Sailing Through!
11/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 413 2766: Thank you
11/03/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 069 9562: Yes please, thank you.
11/03/24, 12:42 pm - +263 78 069 9562: Does this kind of result count for something, please?
11/03/24, 2:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 4:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/03/24, 5:45 pm - +263 78 069 9562: That's okay, thank you. There is something I still don't quite understand. Suppose I get a 100% scholarship and I'm only required pay $1500 per year. Can I still use the earn while you learn program to reduce that amount to 0? <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well
As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 069 9562: My deepest apologies... My network is not doing quite as expected. I really apologise.
12/03/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Yes most definitely Tafara, you can!
12/03/24, 11:14 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tafara @263774132766 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 069 9562: Completing the counselling in a day stage would require me to have a good quality network, which is a big problem at the moment so I think not. Unless we do it when the network is good. I would like to ask if that is possible, please,
12/03/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its alright I understand the network challenges, however we shall resume
12/03/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tafara, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 069 9562: I am 19 years old. I studied at St Anthony's mission for both primary and secondary education. I was part of a quiz club back when I was still in form 1 and 2 but I quit when I realised I could not be present at other times since I was a day scholar. I was also staying with my grandparents so I had house chores to do, which made for a tight schedule. I am a man of science and I feel quite rejuvenated reading about it. I wish to be a mechanical engineer since I could be involved in a lot of science fields that way. I like to think my strengths are my vivid imagination and my ability to ignore normally offensive things people might say or do. As for weaknesses, that would be novels and internet, I could read all day which is quite a distraction. I particularly enjoy science fiction as it gives a lot of room for imagination. I also like gathering knowledge about how the science world is progressing especially astronomy and astrophysics. I stayed with my maternal grandparents who are currently 73 and 87 years old, grandmother and grandfather respectively, all the way till I finished high school. My father worked and still works as a salesperson in Harare. My mother passed when I was 2 and I had to stay with my grandparents. As for the nature of work, I am actually not quite sure myself about the smaller details.
12/03/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for your introduction @263780699562
12/03/24, 2:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
12/03/24, 4:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
