13/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 046 2124: Now Edoofa scholarship program is an organisation which was founded by Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. It's in partnership with Anhad Ltd solutions. It's main goal is to make higher education affordable and accessible to African students. 
Edoofa scholarship is based in Indian universities.
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 046 2124: OK yes l see that's great counseling

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.
*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

05/03/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 046 2124: As for my thoughts l assume that to start in abroad is cheaper because after following the edoofa studients at abroad they always say it is cheaper to study in lndia than in Zimbabwe so this makes me to get attracted most

05/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 046 2124: Ok yhaa this is very excellent Mr keshav
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 046 2124: Yes l have understand
05/03/24, 3:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then let us proceed ahead!
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 046 2124: Ok yhaa thats affordable so its a great program
05/03/24, 4:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words @263780462124 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 046 2124: Ok thats great to know
05/03/24, 4:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.
