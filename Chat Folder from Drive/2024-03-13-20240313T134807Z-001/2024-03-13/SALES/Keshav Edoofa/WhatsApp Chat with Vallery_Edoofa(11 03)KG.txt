11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you <This message was edited>
11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
11/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 201 6213: This is wonderful
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 551 0064: We r really looking forward to our daughter getting a scholarship
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 551 0064: So what are your requirements
11/03/24, 3:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
11/03/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care
Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well
As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 545 4149: Morning all, so what are the requirements of this whole process
12/03/24, 10:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Vallery, Mr. Lazarus and Mrs. Faith, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/03/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 201 6213: Okay okay.....
12/03/24, 2:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Vallery, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 551 0064: Thank u she will come back to u when she has tym in between her lessons... She is at xul
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 201 6213: Alright.
So....My name is Vallery Mwando. I am aged 17. I'm currently doing my Advanced Level (form 5). I study Mathematics, Phyics and Chemistry in the hope of pursuing into Medicinal Studies once I reach university.

 My strengths in education include solving mathematical problems. I also consider myself very good at learning and understanding new things.

 Although being very good at these traits, I would also consider myself weak at engaging with unfamiliar faces.

My hobbies include creating art, listening and imitating vocal pieces, reading novels.

My family background goes like this. The two people in this group are, for a fact, my real parents. The people that brought me in this world. We, as a family lived in Zimbabwe for the first four years of my existence. We moved to South Africa after I turned four. This was done to make it easier for my father to go to school as well as being close and intimate with his family. We lived in South Africa for eight years. I got the blessing of attending school there. We then returned to Zimbabwe so that we could live permanently in a more vivid and familiar environment, since South Africa was nolonger safe for us due to Xenophobia. My dad, however still lives in South Africa due to employment purposes. He still does come to visit every month. My father is a truck driver. He carries cars and other vehicles amongst different countries or cities
12/03/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care
Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
