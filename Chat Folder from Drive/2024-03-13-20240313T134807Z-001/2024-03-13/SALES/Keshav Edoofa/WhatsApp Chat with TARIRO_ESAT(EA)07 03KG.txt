11/03/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 791 7799: Ooh well thank you so much  ,,we really appreciate
11/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 818 7916: OK thank you ,, so is there any room for me to get a scholarship
11/03/24, 12:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 12:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes sure Tariro
11/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 818 7916: OK thank you because I was thinking it ended up there
11/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 791 7799: Thank you so much we really appreciate
11/03/24, 2:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tariro @263777917799 @263788297158 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 4:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/03/24, 6:33 pm - +263 78 818 7916: Yes I have it
11/03/24, 6:35 pm - +263 78 818 7916: Ok here I'm facing a bit challenge of network that's why there's a barrier on our communication

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

I wish you could assist me so that I can work hard to change the background of my family
12/03/24, 11:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tariro. have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
12/03/24, 11:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
12/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 818 7916: When I was in secondary school from form 1 to 4 and form 5 to 6 I was assisted by well wishers or sometimes bt the church and for now I  don't have anyone to assist my higher education
12/03/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Are your parents not willing to support you for your higher education, abroad?
12/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 818 7916: They are willing  but they are not working so it becomes difficult for me
12/03/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Then how are they planning to go ahead with your higher education?
12/03/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 818 7916: For now it's difficult for me to say they have another plan because the most problem we have is financially problems

12/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 791 7799: This message was deleted
12/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 791 7799: We are not working so far that's why we are facing a huge  ll financial challenge
12/03/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/03/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
12/03/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
12/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 791 7799: So are you saying that  we will be paying the fees but it will be less ?
12/03/24, 3:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes the scholarship program reduces your fee to that extent however the parents and the family bear the remaining cost of study!
12/03/24, 4:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/03/24, 6:00 pm - +263 77 791 7799: Oky noted with thanks
