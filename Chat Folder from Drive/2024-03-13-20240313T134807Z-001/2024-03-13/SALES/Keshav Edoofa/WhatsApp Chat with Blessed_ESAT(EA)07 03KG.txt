08/03/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 073 7446: So how can manage to be fully involved in getting the scholarship . We really need to also know the terms and conditions you also offer

08/03/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Brian and Mrs. Jessica 
How are you, please?
08/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 73 370 6704: Good afternoon, How are you.
08/03/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Mr. Brian
08/03/24, 2:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263780737446 @263733706704 @263777203347 @263777449863 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 2:11 pm - +263 73 370 6704: Yes we do
08/03/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Great then Mr. Brian

12/03/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Blessed, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
12/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 073 7446: Yes. I'm ready you may go ahead
12/03/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.

Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
12/03/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Blessed, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
12/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 073 7446: Ooh wow that's good. So can we make the arrangements now. How can l manage to get the acceptance letter

12/03/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
