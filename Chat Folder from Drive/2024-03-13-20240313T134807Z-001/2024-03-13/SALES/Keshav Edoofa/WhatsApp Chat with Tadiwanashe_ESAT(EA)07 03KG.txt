*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 53/100*

Congratulations for Sailing Through!
11/03/24, 12:18 pm - +263 73 798 9020: Thank you sir
11/03/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
11/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 73 798 9020: Yes sir we have gone through that
11/03/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tadiwanashe, @263776212191 , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 73 798 9020: Yes I think so
11/03/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
11/03/24, 3:15 pm - +263 73 798 9020: Ok sir, my full name is Tadiwanashe Nigel Bible, I'm 19 years old turning 20 on the 3rd of November. I have done my ordinary level in 2021 and I've also finished my advanced level last year in 2023. I did biology Geography and Crop Science at advanced level and I got 7 points. I wish to study anything that is associated with medicine and Sciences. I believe that God is my strength and I've got some weaknesses in theoretical knowledge. Then, I have got many hobbies that im interested in, but my favorite hobby is chess. I live with my mom and my other two brothers, my father had passed away in 2021 with a car accident, he was a truck driver. So ryt now, my mom doesn't go to work, but she has got her own hustle where she sell some fruits and vegetables, in other words she's a vendor, and she works in our community which is Norton. I think thus all.
