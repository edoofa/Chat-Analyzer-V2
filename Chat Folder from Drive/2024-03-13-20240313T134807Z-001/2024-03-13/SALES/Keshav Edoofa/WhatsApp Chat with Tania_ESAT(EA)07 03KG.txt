As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

12/03/24, 9:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
12/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 71 525 5431: I understand
12/03/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Tania, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/03/24, 9:42 am - +263 71 525 5431: I can try
12/03/24, 9:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Tania, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/03/24, 9:51 am - +263 71 525 5431: My  name is Tania Mugwidi and I'm currently doing my Advanced level. I would like to study social work. I used to have problems in communicating with other people but now  l am better as l am working on it and improved a lot 

 My father works in Mbare and my mother is a hairdresser at home
12/03/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for introduction, please
12/03/24, 10:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
12/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 525 5431: My father has been taking care of my education
12/03/24, 11:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know in what profession is he in?

12/03/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright!
12/03/24, 12:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So, could you kindly tell me how much your school charges you every term?
12/03/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 525 5431: 140 American state dollars
12/03/24, 2:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Duly noted, please!
12/03/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study social work, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
12/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 71 525 5431: Helping vulnerable people makes my heart feel at ease and l liked the work when l once visited an NGO here with a friend
12/03/24, 2:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is great Tania, I admire your aspirations
12/03/24, 2:30 pm - +263 71 525 5431: Thank you
12/03/24, 3:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Tania, being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.

Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work 

Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.

So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
12/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 525 5431: You may thank you
12/03/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.

*Course Outline*
