12/03/24, 1:01 pm - Arshita: Combining a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree with actuarial science is a strategic choice that can provide a strong foundation for a career in the field of actuarial science. Here's an explanation of the benefits and how the two can complement each other:

Strong Analytical and Mathematical Skills:

Actuarial science heavily relies on mathematical and statistical concepts. A BCom degree, particularly with a focus on quantitative subjects such as mathematics, statistics, and finance, can equip you with the necessary analytical skills to excel in actuarial work.
Financial Knowledge:

BCom programs often include coursework related to finance, accounting, and economics. This financial knowledge is crucial for actuaries who assess and manage financial risks, especially in areas like insurance, pensions, and investments.
Business Acumen:

Actuaries often work in business environments where understanding the broader economic landscape and business operations is essential. A BCom degree can provide a solid grounding in business principles, helping actuaries make informed decisions that align with organizational objectives.
Risk Management Expertise:

Actuaries specialize in assessing and managing risks, and a BCom degree can contribute to your understanding of risk within a business context. This dual expertise can be particularly valuable in roles where actuarial science intersects with business strategy and risk management.
Communication Skills:

Actuaries need to effectively communicate complex findings and recommendations to non-technical stakeholders. A BCom degree often emphasizes communication skills, which can enhance your ability to convey actuarial insights in a clear and understandable manner to clients, executives, and colleagues.
Professional Designations:

Many actuaries pursue professional qualifications from actuarial organizations. Combining a BCom with actuarial science can provide a strong educational background, fulfilling some of the prerequisites for actuarial exams and potentially accelerating your progress toward achieving professional designations.
Diverse Career Opportunities:

The combination of a BCom and actuarial science opens up a range of career opportunities. Actuaries are in demand across various industries, including insurance, finance, consulting, healthcare, and government.
Global Relevance:

Actuarial science is a globally recognized field, and having a BCom degree alongside actuarial qualifications can make you well-equipped to pursue career opportunities internationally.
12/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Ohhh so I would be doing Actuarial Science with Bcomm
12/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Because all I want is to pursue Actuarial Science
12/03/24, 1:05 pm - Arshita: Yes,b come covers the aspects of actuarial science
12/03/24, 1:05 pm - Arshita: And this helps you to prepare for the examination
12/03/24, 1:06 pm - Arshita: Once you are done with bcom and feel like you have the complete knowledge you can give the exam.
12/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Okay let's proceed

12/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 77 112 0881: This is amazing Woww
12/03/24, 1:34 pm - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
12/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 112 0881: During my research I heard about how  big corporations in India have internships I believe with the degree and expirience from the internship I will be able to have a strong CV to attain employment anywhere internationally
12/03/24, 1:48 pm - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
12/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 112 0881: I am not familiar
12/03/24, 1:49 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/03/24, 1:49 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 1:49 pm - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
12/03/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 112 0881: It is something we can work with
12/03/24, 1:52 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
12/03/24, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 3:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

12/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Okay thank you
12/03/24, 3:02 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
12/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Yes
12/03/24, 3:07 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.

12/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Yeahh I do realise
12/03/24, 3:23 pm - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
12/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 112 0881: 1
12/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 112 0881: but honestly also 3
12/03/24, 3:26 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

12/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 112 0881: I have seen them
It's wonderful really
12/03/24, 3:29 pm - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 77 112 0881: My mother and relatives
12/03/24, 3:34 pm - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/03/24, 3:35 pm - +263 77 112 0881: My mother is very supportive of it
They all want me to go abroad as they believe I'm destined for big things
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Not really
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Were do I submit these
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - Arshita: Our admissions team will help you with it
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/03/24, 4:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Yes
12/03/24, 4:29 pm - +263 77 112 0881: How do you know you are eligible
12/03/24, 5:37 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
12/03/24, 5:37 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
12/03/24, 5:40 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Okay Woww that's amazing
12/03/24, 5:40 pm - +263 77 112 0881: So how do I know I am eligible
12/03/24, 5:40 pm - Arshita: The result will be out after final interview
12/03/24, 5:40 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
12/03/24, 5:44 pm - +263 77 112 0881: Ohhh thank you
12/03/24, 5:44 pm - +263 77 112 0881: So what is next for me
12/03/24, 5:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
