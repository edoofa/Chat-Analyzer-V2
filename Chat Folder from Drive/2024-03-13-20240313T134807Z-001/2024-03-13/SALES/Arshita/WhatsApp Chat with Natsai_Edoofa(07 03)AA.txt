09/03/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 156 4919: 1) From my research and understanding, the Edoofa Scholarship program stands as a testament of the transformative power of education in empowering students to overcome financial barriers and achieve academic excellence. Edoofa is not just providing scholarships but also shaping the future through nurturing global leaders, fostering diversity and inclusivity, as well as cultivating a culture of academic excellence . As a student, I am inspired by your vision, impact, and unwavering commitment to empowering students to realize their full potential.

2) My understanding is that the Edoofa Scholarship institution takes on the responsibility of applying to different institutions on behalf of the student. The application fee is waived but the student has to deposit a fee that will be used to pay the tuition of the institution the student will have been accepted to. The program offer 50-100% scholarships to students

09/03/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 156 4919: My name is Natsai Chidavaenzi. I am 19 years old. I come from a family of four. I have two siblings (and older brother and younger sister). My mother is deceased so I live with my father and sister. My sister has cerebral palsy and epilepsy. I enjoy playing the piano, roller skating, travelling and listening to music. One of my key strengths is my strong analytical skills. I have a natural ability to break down complex problems into manageable components, allowing me to develop effective solutions. This skill has been particularly beneficial in academic settings, where I excel in tasks that require critical thinking and problem-solving. My weakness is perfectionism, I tend to obsess over the details which can affect completion of tasks:

1.  I finished U6 in 2022 and I did Computer Science, Chemistry and Physics 

2.  I would like to study Computer Science because I have a lifelong interest in software development. My current goal is to transform Advolution Studios (a web design agency I founded) into an application design & development company that not only allows customers to push the boundaries in their respective fields but also guarantees the security of their user’s data in an age where data integrity and privacy is a real issue. 

3.  My father is a managing Director for a printing, calendar rimming and bookbinding company. My mother is deceased 

4.  What is your parent’s highest education level? 

5.  I have two siblings. My older brother is in the music and entertainment industry and my sister is still in school 

6.  My father has been supporting me this far 

7.  My father will be responsible for supporting my studies abroad 

8.  It was $4000

9.  Arundel School in Harare

11/03/24, 11:35 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
