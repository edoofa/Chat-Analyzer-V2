04/03/24, 3:15 pm - Arshita: Okay so Nyamukasa, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 3:29 pm - Arshita: Alright so Nyamukasa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/03/24, 6:53 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 389 1179: Hello,, so my name is Nyamukasa Farai Nigel l am the first child in a family of two.l sat for my ZIMSEC A level exams in 2023 and l scored 8 points( D in Pure Mathematics, C in Food Science, C in Biology).For extracurricular activities l play volleyball and soccer.

l live with both my parents here in Zimbabwe. My mother is a primary school teacher and my father is a truck driver. 

Given the opportunity to study in India l wish to study radiography, biomedical engineering and biochemistry.
05/03/24, 9:52 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?

05/03/24, 10:01 am - Arshita: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study radiography , biomedical engineering or biochemistry, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 389 1179: ok so the reason l want to study in those areas is because Zimbabwe is still a developing country that is still behind in the health sector and l wish to change that by acquiring the best skills and knowledge to do that
05/03/24, 10:07 am - Arshita: That is well noted
05/03/24, 10:07 am - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

*"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go."*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
06/03/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 389 1179: yes
06/03/24, 10:24 am - Arshita: Greetings!
06/03/24, 10:24 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 389 1179: im ready
06/03/24, 10:55 am - Arshita: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*

06/03/24, 11:31 am - +263 78 389 1179: ok
06/03/24, 11:32 am - Arshita: However Nyamukasa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 389 1179: hmm ok

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
06/03/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 389 1179: l understand the process
06/03/24, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/03/24, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/03/24, 12:07 pm - Arshita: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
