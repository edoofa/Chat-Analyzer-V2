08/03/24, 10:06 am - Arshita: Greetings!
08/03/24, 10:06 am - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 10:06 am - Arshita: Okay so Cornelius, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 391 3564: L am sure but l don't know if my guardians will manage to be present throughout the counselling session

11/03/24, 11:13 am - Arshita: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 391 3564: L will cater for food and accommodation by myself. L thought it was going to be covered with scholarship
11/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 391 3564: Understood
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Arshita: In simple words Cornelius what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

11/03/24, 3:54 pm - Arshita: Edoofa is a *merit based* scholarship providing *50-100%* scholarship. 

The quantum of scholarship depends on *Academic performance, co - curricular activities along with participation in these sessions*
11/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 391 3564: Ok thanks l wasn't able to answer that question
11/03/24, 3:59 pm - Arshita: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 391 3564: Now it is clear , l think that information is what he was seeking for

12/03/24, 9:25 am - +263 71 391 3564: L was also motivated and gain more confidence by that program Earn While Learn but why are they less , is it because some students are having much pressure from their programs or they don't want to be part of it? <This message was edited>
12/03/24, 9:28 am - Arshita: Can you please elaborate?
12/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 71 391 3564: Persistence Muza shared his story and it motivates as well as giving me hope that l might be able to self finance the Cost of education.My question is why students like him are less
12/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 391 3564: Those who manage to self finance themselves
12/03/24, 9:44 am - Arshita: Everyone has their own way of managing the task and even if not 100% a lot of students are able to cover around 70% of their fee
12/03/24, 9:45 am - Arshita: Alright Cornelius, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
12/03/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 391 3564: Yes

*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*

12/03/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 391 3564: Well noted
12/03/24, 9:58 am - Arshita: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/03/24, 10:09 am - +263 71 391 3564: Ok
12/03/24, 10:09 am - Arshita: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
12/03/24, 10:09 am - Arshita: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
12/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 71 391 3564: L am proud edoofian and it feels great to be part of the team
12/03/24, 10:16 am - Arshita: However Cornelius, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
12/03/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 391 3564: Am aware
12/03/24, 10:22 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 391 3564: Thanks l will
12/03/24, 10:34 am - Arshita: Alright Cornelius, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
12/03/24, 10:34 am - Arshita: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
