08/03/24, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 912 7961: Im totally confident about achieving it
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - Arshita: Good to know that!
08/03/24, 3:09 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 912 7961: Yes I did apply to the Jain Deemed to be a university scholarship program then the other scholarships I came across didn't offer the medicine courses that's why I didn't opt for them
08/03/24, 8:02 pm - Arshita: Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at Let us connect at *10:30 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
09/03/24, 10:36 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

09/03/24, 12:42 pm - Arshita: As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course as students need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with high grades to be eligible for Medicine and the process is regulated by the National Testing Agency under Ministry of Education. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference in the health sector, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*
*4) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*5) Bachelor of Optometry*
*6) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology* etc

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
09/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 912 7961: I would like that
09/03/24, 12:50 pm - Arshita: May I know which one should I please?
09/03/24, 7:11 pm - +263 78 912 7961: The bachelor of science in biotechnology
10/03/24, 6:58 pm - Arshita: Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at Let us connect at *9:00 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session

11/03/24, 9:36 am - Arshita: For that you will have to clear NEET examination which is toughest examination
11/03/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 912 7961: Okay tell me more about the NEET examination, I might consider sitting for it
11/03/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: NEET, which stands for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, is a highly competitive medical entrance examination in India. It is conducted for admission to undergraduate medical and dental programs in government and private medical colleges across the country. While NEET provides a pathway to pursue a career in medicine, there are certain challenges and difficulties associated with the exam:

Vast Syllabus:

NEET covers an extensive syllabus that includes physics, chemistry, and biology (botany and zoology). The sheer volume of topics to be covered can be overwhelming for some students.
Intense Competition:

The competition for medical seats through NEET is extremely high. Thousands of students across the country compete for a limited number of seats, making it one of the most competitive exams in India.
Time Pressure:

NEET is a time-bound exam, and candidates have to answer a significant number of questions within a stipulated time. Managing time efficiently during the exam can be challenging, especially considering the complexity of some questions.
Conceptual Difficulty:

The questions in NEET are designed to test not only the factual knowledge of candidates but also their understanding of concepts and the ability to apply them. This requires a deep understanding of the subjects and the ability to solve complex problems.
Single Entrance Exam:

The pressure on students increases because NEET is the sole entrance exam for most medical colleges in India. Unlike engineering, where students can appear for multiple entrance exams, medical aspirants rely heavily on NEET for admission.
Emphasis on NCERT Syllabus:

NEET places a significant emphasis on the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) syllabus. Students who have not thoroughly studied NCERT textbooks during their school years may find it challenging to grasp certain concepts.
Psychological Stress:

The high stakes of NEET, coupled with intense competition and societal expectations, can lead to significant psychological stress and pressure on students.
Limited Attempts:

NEET has a limit on the number of attempts a candidate can make. This adds to the stress and anxiety, as candidates may feel the pressure to perform well within a limited number of chances.

Do you know how that is done?
12/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 912 7961: No I don't
12/03/24, 1:51 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
