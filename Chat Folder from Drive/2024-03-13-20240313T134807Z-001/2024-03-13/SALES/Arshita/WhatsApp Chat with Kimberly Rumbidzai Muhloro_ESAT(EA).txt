*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 68/100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through! *I request you to add your Parents and Guardians so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.*

05/03/24, 10:51 am - Arshita: Greetings!
05/03/24, 10:52 am - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 10:52 am - Arshita: Okay so Kimberly, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 4:17 pm - Arshita: Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session 

Meanwhile, you can go through this video to learn more about the experience of Edoofians.

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

08/03/24, 10:09 am - Arshita: Greetings!
08/03/24, 10:10 am - Arshita: Alright so Kimberly, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
08/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 533 0201: I'm in my final A level year. I'm doing Maths, Physics, Computer science and Statistics. After the l have written my exams l want to study the Bachelors in Robotics and Automation. I was born in a family of 4 children whilst I'm the first born. My father works in South Africa and my mother works in Zimbabwe. My father is an Electrician and my mother is self employed
08/03/24, 10:25 am - Arshita: So, could you kindly tell me the name of the school and how much they charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
08/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 533 0201: Name of school is Advent Hope Academy. Currently we are payinh 550USD  and both my parents are supporting my education
08/03/24, 10:32 am - Arshita: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Robotics, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
08/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 533 0201: The world is evolving and technology is advancing so technically robots make work easier and they can work in conditions that humans cannot
08/03/24, 10:36 am - Arshita: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

08/03/24, 10:41 am - Arshita: Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level?
08/03/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 533 0201: Maths, Physics, Computer science and Statistics
08/03/24, 10:43 am - Arshita: Noted
08/03/24, 10:43 am - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/03/24, 10:44 am - +263 71 533 0201: I'm very confident about it
08/03/24, 10:44 am - Arshita: Noted
08/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 71 533 0201: Good
