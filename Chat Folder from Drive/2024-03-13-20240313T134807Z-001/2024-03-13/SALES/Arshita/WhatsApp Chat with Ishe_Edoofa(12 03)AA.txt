*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
12/03/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 883 2515: Umm im not
12/03/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/03/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
12/03/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 883 2515: Umm no. Im in family of 6 children so it will become difficult as my parents helps my siblings to finish their academic too
12/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 883 2515: Is it allowed to work while yu are under study visa
12/03/24, 3:03 pm - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
12/03/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 883 2515: Yaah we ar able to
12/03/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 883 2515: Its depend, if affordable we can try too
12/03/24, 3:53 pm - Arshita: Higher education is an important aspect  and  requires financial assistance.

𝕁𝕠𝕝𝕒𝕤𝕎𝕙𝕒𝕥𝕤𝔸𝕡𝕡.𝕘𝕣𝕠𝕦𝕡_

 *Tuesday ,12 March 2024*
 ~*___________________________*~
The Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education (ZIMCHE) named seven (7) mainly Cypriot institutions which it says are no longer recognised as degree awarding institutions.

In a statement on Monday, 11 March, ZIMCHE stated that after a review of the accreditation status of various foreign higher education institutions, seven universities were delisted without providing specific reasons. Reads the statement:

This notice is to inform the public that the following institutions are no longer accredited by ZIMCHE: Girne American University (Northern Cyprus), Sharda University of India, Parul University (India), Near East University (Northern Cyprus), University of Kyrenia (Northern Cyprus), The European University of Lefke (Northern Cyprus), and University of Nicosia (Northern Cyprus).

In light of this development, we strongly urge the public to verify the accreditation status of foreign universities before considering enrollment for themselves or their children. Studying at an unaccredited institution may result in financial loss and have serious implications for one’s academic qualifications and career prospects.

In an earlier statement last week, ZIMCHE said it did not recognise all degrees offered in Zimbabwe by International Institute of Philanthropy (IIP), which it said had not complied with local regulations.
