To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University

To get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

1. *Qualification to the ESAT Exam* (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
2. *A Level and Previous Results* 
3. *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who can complete their counselling stage within a day has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
4. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counselling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/03/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 769 1023: Yes I do

06/03/24, 10:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
06/03/24, 11:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

*Proverbs 9:9 (NIV):*
*"Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
11/03/24, 11:50 am - +263 73 371 1001: Morning network in Zimbabwe is a bit challenging
11/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 73 371 1001: We can continue
11/03/24, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263733711001 @8618866683548*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
11/03/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263733711001 @8618866683548* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Tawananyadra* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Tawananyadra's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
11/03/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *18th or 19th of March 2024* for $200 and the *18th or 19th of April 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *18th or 19th of March 2024*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/03/24, 12:18 pm - +263 73 371 1001: If she is found eligible if l am financially stable by then I will make the payment.
11/03/24, 12:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on the issue you are facing?
11/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 73 371 1001: Iam facing a challenge in that the due dates given above are also the due dates for payment of her exam fees here in Zimbabwe. I also have another daughter who also has her final exam this year and the due dates are matching with yours and another son at college hence its a challenge to me
11/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I totally understand the same, So how will you manage?
11/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 73 371 1001: At this point in time I can not clearly say I can manage
11/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 73 371 1001: But if all factors remain constant I will make the payment
11/03/24, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on what you meant by this statement?
11/03/24, 1:18 pm - +263 73 371 1001: I am saying at this point in time I'm not financially stable since I have due dates for payment of my other kids which are coinciding with yours. I cannot openly say I can make it.

12/03/24, 9:01 am - +263 73 371 1001: Good morning
12/03/24, 9:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
12/03/24, 9:21 am - +263 73 371 1001: As it looks if I fail to make the initial payment what will be the next step in the event that Tawananyasha is found eligible
12/03/24, 10:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what are your plans ahead regarding your child higher education?
12/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 73 371 1001: My plans are that she should go to tertiary education after she her high school education
12/03/24, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: So @263733711001 after our discussion yesterday, I spoke with the Edoofa Academic board, since the number of scholarship seats is limited in number and Since Tawananyadra have appeared for the ESAT exam as well. So if she manages to get selected for the program then you will be provided with an opportunity to pay your enrollment fees partially. That is if Tawananyadra is selected for the program then you will have to pay the $100 in the coming 7 days to reserve Tawananyadra's seat and the remaining fees can be paid on the 1st week of April
12/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 73 371 1001: Okay understood
12/03/24, 10:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: So will you be able to manage the same?
12/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 73 371 1001: I will try and manage
12/03/24, 11:37 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
12/03/24, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263733711001 We Understand the importance of a parent's participation in the child's education, Hence our Program Director has personally drafted a letter for you so that you get a better understanding of the program and how to be prepared for the process ahead,
*So Now I would like you to go through this Letter from the Program Director, Do let me know once you have read it and share your understanding from the same within 50-100 words/Or you can use voice notes*.
12/03/24, 4:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/03/24, 5:04 pm - +263 73 371 1001: I understand but I had too many commitments I will reply you soon.
12/03/24, 5:54 pm - +263 73 371 1001: I have read and understood the terms and conditions stated in the letter. It states that as a parent I should help my child to have informed decisions on various components of her tertiary education. I understand that Edoofa helps my child to study abroad by bringing the costs of her education down. I also understand that if my child is meritorious Edoofa can offer her a 100%scholarship on tuition and accommodation while I manage the rest. Edoofa can provide meaningful employment and can train her to be ready globally. I should not randomly conclude discussions as this may destroy my child's aspirations.
