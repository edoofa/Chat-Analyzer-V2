*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

12/03/24, 8:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
12/03/24, 8:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
12/03/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 880 9980: Afternoon sir I have a question
12/03/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 880 9980: How many points do you expect from your students
12/03/24, 4:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me assist you with the same
12/03/24, 4:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/03/24, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

So we are looking for a scholarship we can afford .
Yesterday I was wondering if you can offer my daughter part time jobs at the campus for her to help us pay for her tuition .
