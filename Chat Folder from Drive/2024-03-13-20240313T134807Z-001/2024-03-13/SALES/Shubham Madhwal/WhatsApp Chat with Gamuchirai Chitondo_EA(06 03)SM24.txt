Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
11/03/24, 10:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.


Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I am an upper 6 Advanced level student at  the herentals  college in kuwadzana 6 harare province , doing pure mathematics statistics and geography, very hard working and aiming to score  high and have passion in studying mechanical engineering at University level.


My Mother is self employed and she holds an ordinary level certificate only because she could not get further with school because  she couldn't afford for further studies 

Mr Evans in collaboration with my mother had been supporting me for my education up to this level 


Actually my parents can not afford to fund me fully for my studies abroad, with that being the main reason why i had decided to apply for this scholarship, with a full belief that i might get help from the program 


I do not have siblings I'm the only child in our family

I'm studying at the herentals college located in kuwadzana 6 Harare province, paying $135 fees term
12/03/24, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you become an overall better person, and what activities you participated in your school for your holistic growth?
12/03/24, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/03/24, 9:11 pm - +263 71 262 6235: Studying at herentals college really improved my learning area mostly because of the teaching strategies of the tutors there are very understandable and also makes education a bit more easier and gave me more passion and eagerness to continue with school hence achieving my dream
12/03/24, 9:32 pm - +263 71 262 6235: As an English speaking environment, Herentals college helped me grow my vocabulary and sharpened my English speaking skills
