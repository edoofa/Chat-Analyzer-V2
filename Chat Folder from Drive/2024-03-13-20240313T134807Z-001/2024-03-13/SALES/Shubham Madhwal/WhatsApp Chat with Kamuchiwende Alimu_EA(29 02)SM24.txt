Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

04/03/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey.... let me say something about my previous school then . Previously before Chinhoyi 2 High , l was at Parkinson Secondary where l did my O Level which was one of the best schools in Shurugwi (midlands) Parkinson was headed by Mr Gombingo. The teachers there were very good and they used to monitor me closely so that l would remain on the right lane which contributed to my betterness  and also there was a guidance and counselling group where we were taught good morals and values which l used to panel beat  my life and became a well mannered and respectful person l am  today . At Parkinson when l was a form two kid l was made a prefect then eventually became the headgirl of my school because l was believed to be motivating and a good example who had good influences on others  when l was in form four. Besides the leadership part , l was also a good chess player from form one and the highest level l reached in terms of chess competitions was the national level .
04/03/24, 9:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: So you shared that your aunt assist's you for your higher education, Have you told her that you have applied for the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 9:12 am - +263 78 110 5743: Yes
05/03/24, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: Morning morning
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: I am in
05/03/24, 10:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
05/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey  , let's say l have acquired the scholarship what are the requirements
05/03/24, 11:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Yes sure
05/03/24, 11:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

05/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey sure
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

06/03/24, 8:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/03/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 110 5743: Am in
06/03/24, 8:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
06/03/24, 9:14 am - +263 78 110 5743: No questions
06/03/24, 9:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please why did you not answer the question Ii shared with you yesterday?
06/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Oooh sorry so l was thinking that l answered it already
06/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Let me answer it quickly my apologies sir
06/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted,  I am waiting for your response!
06/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: There quite a lot of factors which motivates me to persue this career field . 
My O Level geography teacher was someone who motivated me the most both directly and indirectly . The way he taught us always gave me passion towards knowing more about geology and how the earth goes . Another thing on him that motivated me was the way he was proud of the subject he taught he felt proud of knowing all those kinds of interesting things on earth ,how it began how the earth ended up being the way it is today and also how the rocks form . His consistent talk about this grew this bold passion towards being a geologist because l always said to myself that one day l want to study these rocks get to know their nature and dig deeper into this interesting  geology thing . I have that passion of being able to predict how minerals occur on a certain place and how they are distributed l want to know how to predict the time duration the minerals will be still available in a certain are .
It is also said that by studying rocks , fossils, and landforms geologists can piece together the story of how our planet has evolved over millions of years so l would also want to see that for myself because this deep time perspective not only provides insight into the past but also helps us better understand the present and anticipate the future implications of geological phenomena . 
Another motivating factor for me is the interdisciplinary nature of geology. As a geologist l would have the opportunity to collaborate with scientists from various fields including physics ,chemistry , biology and environmental science.
06/03/24, 10:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: So In Which year will you appear for your A-Level examination?
06/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 110 5743: This year in November

07/03/24, 8:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 9:13 am - +260 773409336: Amen good morning to you too
07/03/24, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
07/03/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 110 5743: I can see that if I'm provided with this career opportunity it will be possible for me to do everything l have always wanted to do , studying the earth and everything about it .

Another thing is getting into Edoofa's Programme will be helpful becoz of the reasonable fees and also the level of education l will get through Edoofa is high. Edoofa will minimise my risks of being a school dropout before the fulfilment of my dreams.
07/03/24, 11:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.

I am back from the meeting,
Shall we now continue with our session?
07/03/24, 3:29 pm - +260 773409336: Good afternoon I think now she is in her extra lessons she will be online when she is done
07/03/24, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
07/03/24, 3:37 pm - +260 773409336: Okay
07/03/24, 3:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

11/03/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 110 5743: That's pretty much amazing thank you
11/03/24, 12:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
11/03/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Sure ... l will answer you right after my lesson l got a lesson l have to attend right now ... so as soon as l am done l will notify you by sending you my response
11/03/24, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
11/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Not exactly ... Edoofa was my first attempt
11/03/24, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?

11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Understood
11/03/24, 1:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
11/03/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Okey sure

11/03/24, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/03/24, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
11/03/24, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

11/03/24, 2:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

11/03/24, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 110 5743: It is .... l have been looking for something like this
11/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Until a few years ago, the cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for the majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, and emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
11/03/24, 2:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year. Isn't it?*
11/03/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Yes
11/03/24, 2:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 110 5743: According to my understanding this is a diagram showing the steps one needs to pass through in order to get full acceptance into the Edoofa ....
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/03/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Understood
11/03/24, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/03/24, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

11/03/24, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
11/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Earn While You Learn
11/03/24, 3:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
11/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 110 5743: My mom and aunt
11/03/24, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
11/03/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Amazing
11/03/24, 3:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
11/03/24, 3:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Ok
11/03/24, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
11/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Understiid
11/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Understood
11/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
11/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
11/03/24, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Okeey
11/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
11/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).
11/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
11/03/24, 4:42 pm - +263 78 110 5743: Okey ... not bad
