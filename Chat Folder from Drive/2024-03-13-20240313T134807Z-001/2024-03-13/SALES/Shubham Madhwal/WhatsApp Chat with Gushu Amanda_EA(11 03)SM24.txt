12/03/24, 7:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Gushu Amanda
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Academician at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 

We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Munyaradzi*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
12/03/24, 4:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
