11/03/24, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Respect Chikobvu
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Academician at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 

We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Abraham*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
11/03/24, 12:25 pm - +263 71 833 2871: Ok do you mind if I'll be online after an hour
11/03/24, 12:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Respect,
Is there any reason because of which you will be active after an hour and not now?
11/03/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 833 2871: Yeah I'm in a lesson
11/03/24, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted Respect, So please update me once you are available for the session next hour
11/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 833 2871: I'm back
11/03/24, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
11/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 833 2871: Yeah
11/03/24, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.
11/03/24, 4:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 8:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
12/03/24, 4:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
