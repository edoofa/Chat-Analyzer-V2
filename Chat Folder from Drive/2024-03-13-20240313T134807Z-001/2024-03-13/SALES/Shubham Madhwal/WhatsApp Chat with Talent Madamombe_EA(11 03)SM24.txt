I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Academician at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 

We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Munyaradzi*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
