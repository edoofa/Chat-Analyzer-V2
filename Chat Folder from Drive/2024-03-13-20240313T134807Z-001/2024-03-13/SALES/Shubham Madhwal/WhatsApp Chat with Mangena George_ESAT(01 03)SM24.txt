*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
02/03/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 367 3481: Morning
02/03/24, 9:20 am - +44 7707 484312: Good morning
02/03/24, 9:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 12:25 pm - +44 7707 484312: Thank you so much we are most grateful for your consideration and would love so much for George to be part of family
02/03/24, 12:26 pm - +44 7707 484312: So where do we stand as of now and what is required of us to do
02/03/24, 12:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so George, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/03/24, 1:25 pm - ~ Mai George added +263 77 310 8136

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
04/03/24, 8:08 am - +263 77 367 3481: Good morning
04/03/24, 8:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
04/03/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 310 8136: There are no questions for now

05/03/24, 10:02 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Hie sir sorry for the late reply I was
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 310 8136: In a biology lecture
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Im ready we can proceed
05/03/24, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So George, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
05/03/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 310 8136: I haven't researched specifically for India but I  researched Globally and found  that some universities require me to have working experience at hospitals and observe what the medical practitioners will be doing  and that's what I was  doing and  also l have to acquire good A level results but I would be more than happy if you could help me with more detail
05/03/24, 1:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 367 3481: Since George is already doing chemistry, biology and maths does it automatically mean he is not eligible to study medicine in India.
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please  as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

05/03/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 310 8136: But l will try by all means to make myself available in between lessons
06/03/24, 8:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

06/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 310 8136: Yess l did sir and I would like option 1
06/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 310 8136: Which is bachelor of science in biochemistry

06/03/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 310 8136: Yes sir
06/03/24, 10:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry or B.Sc. Biochemistry (B.Sc. Biochem)* is an undergraduate course in chemical and physio-chemical processes. The course duration is for three years.

06/03/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 310 8136: Thank you
06/03/24, 11:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
06/03/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 310 8136: I'm just curious about the actual A level passes for that program <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
06/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Ok sir l will try to achieve higher grades by all means
06/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 310 8136: I'm now certisified we can continue <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
06/03/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/03/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 367 3481: Thank you we would be in a position to afford those kind of amounts.
06/03/24, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words George what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 367 3481: Thank you so much that makes for a very big difference
06/03/24, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
06/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Thank you
06/03/24, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/03/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Yess they are ones who will be supporting me
06/03/24, 4:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Yes <This message was edited>

06/03/24, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Despite, your Low results of ESAT, I have specially recommended her application for an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counsellor I feel it is a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 310 8136: So is the money needed after my A level results are out
06/03/24, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: No please. It is needed once you get selected for the program

07/03/24, 8:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.

07/03/24, 9:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: How are you ?
07/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 310 8136: Good morning sir
07/03/24, 10:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
07/03/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 310 8136: No
07/03/24, 10:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
07/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 367 3481: That would be fine and also we get money at the end of the month
07/03/24, 11:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

07/03/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Ok
07/03/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 310 8136: No
07/03/24, 3:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello,
I am back from the meeting,
Shall we now continue with our session?
07/03/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Yes
07/03/24, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
07/03/24, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
07/03/24, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
07/03/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Yes
07/03/24, 4:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
07/03/24, 4:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/03/24, 4:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now would you like to ask anything?
07/03/24, 7:25 pm - +263 77 310 8136: No l have understood
07/03/24, 9:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

08/03/24, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263773108136 @447707484312*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that *George* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - +44 7707 484312: George would be studying for the bachelor of science in biochemistry in the Edoofa program
08/03/24, 1:56 pm - +44 7707 484312: He will  be studying in Idia

08/03/24, 3:02 pm - +44 7707 484312: The earn while learn program is an initiative by edoofa to help students on the scholarship program further reduce their costs for studying by engaging them in work attachments relevant to their area of study which also gives them valuable work experience as much as financial benefits
08/03/24, 3:08 pm - +44 7707 484312: I am clear about the fact that we shall have to pay the registration fee after receiving the offer letter from the university to finalise the university selection and reserve the scholarship seat and to the fact that the fee is part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship
08/03/24, 3:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@@447707484312* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *George* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *George's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
08/03/24, 3:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *14th or 15th of March 2024* for $200 and the *14th or 15th of April 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *14th or 15th of March 2024*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/03/24, 3:25 pm - +44 7707 484312: I get my salary at the end of march
08/03/24, 3:26 pm - +44 7707 484312: Is there a way I can pay the whole fee at end of march
