We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Sizalobuhle*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

So are we good to begin your session?

12/03/24, 11:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

*Please let me know once you have added them*
12/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 548 0277: Ok
12/03/24, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
