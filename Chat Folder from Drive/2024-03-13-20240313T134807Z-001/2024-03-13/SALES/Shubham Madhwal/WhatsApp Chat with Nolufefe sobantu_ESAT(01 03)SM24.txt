To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation.

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
04/03/24, 8:44 am - +263 73 322 2240: Good morning
04/03/24, 9:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: How are you @263733222240 ?
04/03/24, 9:21 am - +263 73 322 2240: I’m fine thanks and how are you
04/03/24, 9:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
04/03/24, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so sobantu, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 6:33 am - +263 73 322 2240: Yes Sir
05/03/24, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

11/03/24, 5:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
