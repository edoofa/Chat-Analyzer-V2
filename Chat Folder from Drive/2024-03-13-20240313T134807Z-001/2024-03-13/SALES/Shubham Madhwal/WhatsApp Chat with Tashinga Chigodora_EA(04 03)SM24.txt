Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
06/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Unfortunately I don't know anything
06/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 688 9073: I only know that its a platform that provides scholarships
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
06/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Ok
06/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 688 9073: I now have a general idea
06/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

07/03/24, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 688 9073: Amen
07/03/24, 9:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, and what all activities did you participated in your school for your holistic growth?
07/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 688 9073: Well l studied at St Patrick's high school, located 38km outside gweru. It is an Anglican school and fortunately for me l was privileged to live at a monastery with Anglican nuns and brothers who taught me the essence of daily prayers and meditation as well as devotion to God. At St Patrick's high school, church is mandatory for everyone, so every Sunday and Wednesday morning, people went to church for communion and also every weekday after lessons, we went to a church service called evensong for 30 minutes to 1hour,this helped me to build a prayerful nature
07/03/24, 10:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Social Worker, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?

07/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 688 9073: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 688 9073: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted Tashinga
Please, So why have you not considered opting for Law?
07/03/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 688 9073: I don't feel passionate about law the same way l feel for social but l would take as a second option though
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: It's fantastic to hear about your passion for Social Work and your desire to bring about positive change in society. The field of Social Work indeed provides a strong foundation for making a meaningful impact on individuals and communities facing various challenges. I'd like to share with you how pursuing a degree in Law can also align with your goals and contribute to the positive transformation you're seeking.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: In both Social Work and Law, the emphasis lies on addressing social issues, promoting justice, and advocating for those who need support. Social Work equips individuals to work directly with people in diverse settings, while Law provides a broader perspective on addressing societal issues through legal frameworks and systemic change.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: Just like in Social Work, a legal education exposes you to a range of critical issues such as discrimination, inequality, and social justice. As a lawyer, you have the power to influence policy, challenge systemic barriers, and advocate for those who may not have a voice. The legal profession offers opportunities to work in areas that align with your passion, such as human rights, public interest law, or social justice advocacy.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: Moreover, legal professionals often collaborate with social workers to address complex issues comprehensively. For example, in cases involving child welfare, mental health, or community development, a multidisciplinary approach involving both legal and social work expertise can lead to more effective and lasting solutions.
07/03/24, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: By combining your dedication to social change with a legal education, you can broaden your impact and contribute to positive transformations on both individual and systemic levels. You'll gain skills in legal analysis, advocacy, and policymaking that complement the strengths acquired through a Social Work degree. This dual perspective can be a powerful asset as you work towards creating a more just and equitable society.
07/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 688 9073: Ok l see what you are getting at, law truly is a way to help others as an advocate but l just pefer social work, but if need be, l might consider law as a second option
07/03/24, 11:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please excuse me for the interruption, but I have an important meeting scheduled with the Academic Board to discuss your application. I'll be away momentarily, but I'll inform you as soon as I return. Thank you for your understanding.
07/03/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 688 9073: Ok, thank you sir
07/03/24, 3:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello,

07/03/24, 5:39 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Yes

Till then please take care.

11/03/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
11/03/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
11/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Well, to begin with, the school fees in Zimbabwe are generally high and always changing, secondly, l believe studying abroad makes ine marketable to many parts of the world and lastly, l believe that vy generally meeting and studying with people of various cultures, one becomes a diverse and accepting person which is a requirement for studying social work
11/03/24, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
11/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 688 9073: No p hadn't actually applied to any university as of yet since l was in need of scholarship funds

11/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Ok
11/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
11/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/03/24, 1:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
11/03/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 688 9073: This is very soothing because university fees are very high in Zimbabwe
11/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Is it possible to get a 100% covered scholarship from Edoofa
11/03/24, 3:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
11/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Ok, can you tell me a bit more about the earn while you learn program
11/03/24, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/03/24, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
11/03/24, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

11/03/24, 3:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Wow, soo many people earning so much money
11/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Yes l can see that its different from the other scholarships
11/03/24, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Until a few years ago, the cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for the majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, and emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
11/03/24, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year. Isn't it?*
11/03/24, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
11/03/24, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 5:38 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Yes that is true
11/03/24, 5:39 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Im sorry, we currently have a power problem in our area so my phone's battery was dead
11/03/24, 5:40 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Ok p understand, l will make sure to be available tomorrow
11/03/24, 5:41 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Well l only wanted to ask whether there are specific schools where edoofian students study at or one can choose a school of choice
12/03/24, 7:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
12/03/24, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/03/24, 4:37 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Im sorry sir but there's a power outage in our area,
12/03/24, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
12/03/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 688 9073: Im really sorry sir
