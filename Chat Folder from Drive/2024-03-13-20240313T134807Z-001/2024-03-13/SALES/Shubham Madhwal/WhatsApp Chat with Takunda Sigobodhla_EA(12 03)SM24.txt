Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/03/24, 2:26 pm - +27 79 279 1938: How are you Sir?
We glad to chat with you.
12/03/24, 2:33 pm - +27 79 279 1938: We do not much understanding of Edoofa except to say it offers a variety of scholarship to different countries. I was referred to Edoofa by a friend.

12/03/24, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
12/03/24, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.


Our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the lowest annual Fee Possible
12/03/24, 3:12 pm - +27 79 279 1938: It is really an excellent program.

I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - +27 79 279 1938: Thank you Sir

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Takunda*, right?
12/03/24, 4:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 4:44 pm - +27 79 279 1938: My name is Takura Sigobodhla. I was born on 10th March 1965 in  Chinhoyi in Mashonaland West province of Zimbabwe. 

I did my primary and secondary education in Zimbabwe. After my secondary education, I worked as temporary teacher for few years. I later joined civil service as a clerk before enrolling for a teacher training education program in 1994 and graduated in 1998. 
After qualifying as a teacher, I further enrolled with the Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) and acquired a  Bachelor of Education in Educational Management.
(BEd).

I later enrolled with the University again to pursue a Master's degree in Educational Management degree (MEd).

I migrated to South Africa in 2008 where I am working as a teacher. In South Africa, I enrolled with the University of South Africa and obtained a PhD in Educational Philosophy. I am a teacher by profession.

My level of education motivates me to support my son to do the same. Being a young man he still has the potential and capabilities to achieve, so we should support him to attain that. Again, working outside country it's greater motivator for me. For example, the level of competition outside is a challenging factor especially for my young man like Takunda. I would like him meet those challenges and be able overcome. U The sky is the limit for him.
Currently, I am working as teacher in South Africa and my wife is Zimbabwe. Takunda L. Sigobodhla is our second born.
