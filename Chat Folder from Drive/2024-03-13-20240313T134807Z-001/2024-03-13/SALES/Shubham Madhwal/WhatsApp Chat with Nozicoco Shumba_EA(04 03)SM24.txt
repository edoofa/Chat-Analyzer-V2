11/03/24, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
12/03/24, 7:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application
12/03/24, 7:45 pm - +263 77 496 5229: I have a lot of lessons
