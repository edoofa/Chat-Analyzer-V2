Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
06/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 307 6902: Hello sir how are yu
06/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 307 6902: I dont have much understanding about it bt I just know tt this program can help my son to fulfill his dreams academically
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
06/03/24, 2:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
06/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 307 6902: thank yu for givin this information I really appreciate
06/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 307 6902: bt if I may ask how will the students self-sponcer theiselves
06/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 307 6902: *theirselves
06/03/24, 2:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So, the SEELS/EWYL is simply for students to work on live industry-level projects so that the students can self-sponsor their college fees. The projects usually are related to the 21st Century job market-relevant skills or the course that the student is pursuing which will be beneficial for you once the student applies for a job as well.
06/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 307 6902: so basically they will be employed .....workin at the same tym doing their academics
06/03/24, 2:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, correct!
06/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 307 6902: okay so what kind of jobs will they be doin
06/03/24, 3:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will be sharing about the same in detail in our session ahead please
06/03/24, 3:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
