05/03/24, 12:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so Nokuthula, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

08/03/24, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Despite, your Low results of ESAT, I have specially recommended her application for an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counsellor I feel it is a great privilege that has been offered to you.
08/03/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 334 7244: It indeed is a privilege
08/03/24, 4:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
08/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 334 7244: Okay

08/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/03/24, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 and Step 6 of your Edoofa Cycle?
08/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 71 334 7244: Yes I do,, thank you
08/03/24, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
08/03/24, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - +263 71 334 7244: Okay I will talk to them
08/03/24, 4:49 pm - +263 71 334 7244: I will tell you once we discuss the asoects
11/03/24, 9:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

11/03/24, 5:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
