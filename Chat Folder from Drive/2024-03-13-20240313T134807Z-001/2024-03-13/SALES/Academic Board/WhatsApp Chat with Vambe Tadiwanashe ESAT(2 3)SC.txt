I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 59/100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through!
05/03/24, 10:12 am - Academic Board: I hope you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program shared at venue of ESAT'24 Examination?
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University

05/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 528 0399: Thank you for the Brochures and Flyers
05/03/24, 11:18 am - Academic Board: Okay so Tadiwanashe, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 528 0399: Tadiwa is a bright student  from Pinary School to Secondary School even the results she gets last Term hives me hope that she will these four sognificant metrics to get a higher quantum of scholarship
05/03/24, 11:45 am - Academic Board: Alright,@263775280399 , to facilitate your integration into our vibrant student community, we'd like to begin with your introduction.

As a parent responding on behalf of your child, could you please provide us with some insight into your child's background, education, intended field of study, strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background?

Additionally, we would appreciate learning more about your work as parents. Where do you currently work (location), and in which specific field or profession do you specialize?
