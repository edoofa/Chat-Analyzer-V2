02/03/24, 10:03 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Dear Parents and Lisa,

I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 41 /100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through! *I request you to your Parents to be proactive so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.*
02/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 815 5192: Thank you so much
02/03/24, 10:07 am - Academic Board: We understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
02/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 815 5192: Noted
02/03/24, 10:18 am - Academic Board: Okay so Lisa, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results
02/03/24, 10:18 am - Academic Board: *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

How are you doing today ?
11/03/24, 9:27 am - Academic Board: Good morning
 I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
11/03/24, 4:34 pm - Academic Board: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
12/03/24, 9:02 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Everyone,

12/03/24, 7:58 pm - Academic Board: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
