May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
05/03/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 373 1120: Indian higher education is known for its affordability and accessibility, as well as its focus on practical skills and job readiness. Indian universities are also highly ranked, with several in the top 100 globally.  So studying in India would be a great opportunity
05/03/24, 1:12 pm - Academic Board: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

05/03/24, 1:40 pm - +263 71 373 1120: Ouky ouky i got it
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - Academic Board: Okay well Tatenda, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
05/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 373 1120: Basically studying in India would grant mee nationality as i willl be wish to work in India after i have completed my studies

I aim to be recognised as one of the best n create history
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - Academic Board: That is remarkable, Tatenda. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 373 1120: No i would be glad to hear more about it
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Academic Board: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Academic Board: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 2:21 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:21 pm - Academic Board: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 373 1120: Ouky ouky i see
05/03/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 373 1120: Hw much am i allowed to pay per month
06/03/24, 9:00 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/03/24, 9:07 am - +263 71 373 1120: Good morning
06/03/24, 9:15 am - Academic Board: Now you see Tatenda, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
06/03/24, 9:15 am - +27 68 597 7765: Good morning thank you
06/03/24, 9:17 am - Academic Board: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
06/03/24, 10:07 am - +27 68 597 7765: Thank you so much for your time and everything I don't we will manage that amount we thought its 100%  free anyway have a great time
06/03/24, 10:21 am - +27 68 597 7765: We won't manage it
06/03/24, 10:39 am - Academic Board: Which part do you feel is not affordable for you ?
06/03/24, 2:59 pm - Academic Board: Are we connected ?
06/03/24, 3:12 pm - +27 68 597 7765: We won't manage the any amount of money thank you
06/03/24, 3:23 pm - Academic Board: Have you researched about the cost of Education in your own country ?
06/03/24, 3:33 pm - +27 68 597 7765: Yes
06/03/24, 3:39 pm - Academic Board: Can you share the cost with me ?
06/03/24, 3:42 pm - +27 68 597 7765: I said thank you so much we cant afford any amount we need free scholarship
06/03/24, 4:17 pm - Academic Board: Tatenda , It's crucial to understand that avoiding or closing discussions about concerns will not lead to solutions. Transparency and open communication are key to resolving issues effectively. As an industry leader with extensive experience mentoring thousands of students from backgrounds similar to yours over the past six years, I have accumulated valuable knowledge and insights. By openly discussing your concerns with me, I can leverage my experience to provide you with tailored guidance and support. Every student I've worked with shares a common trait: they openly seek answers and guidance. Therefore, by engaging in open dialogue, we can work together to address your challenges and find solutions that align with your goals and circumstances.
06/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 373 1120: We actually thought the scholarship was fully funded. Thank you for your time and consideration 3000 we cant afford it
06/03/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 373 1120: I understand
06/03/24, 4:37 pm - Academic Board: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
