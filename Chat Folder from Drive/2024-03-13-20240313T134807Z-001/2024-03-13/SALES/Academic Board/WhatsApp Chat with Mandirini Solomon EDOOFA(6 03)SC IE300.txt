08/03/24, 9:54 am - Academic Board: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*

*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
08/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 444 1730: Amen! God first, go Forward. Thank you for the wise words.
08/03/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 444 1730: Mr Mandirini is not on Whatsapp. Is there anything bad if I add Solomon's elder brother?
08/03/24, 2:24 pm - Academic Board: May I know who in the family takes care of Solomon education financially
08/03/24, 2:24 pm - Academic Board: ?
08/03/24, 6:53 pm - +263 78 541 5812: Well, As Solomon's parents we have been taking care of his education through scratches up to his Advanced Level. Fortunately, he managed to pass his Advanced level  in 2021. But now he's just sitted since then due to financial challenges-we couldn't afford the tertiary education fees that are required. And he's just trying to apply for scholarships or even well wishers maybe, by grace, he might proceed with his education to higher and tertiary education. Unfortunately, his father and I, are not working. His father was given an early retirement years ago where he was working due to a long term illness and even now he is not in good health and is no longer fit for working. I'm taking my responsibility as his better half taking care of his health at home. That's the situation with Solomon, but he has a great passion to learn.
 *Mrs Mandirini*
08/03/24, 7:59 pm - Academic Board: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/03/24, 8:06 pm - +263 78 541 5812: Noted. Thank you.
09/03/24, 8:55 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
11/03/24, 9:28 am - Academic Board: Good morning
 I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
11/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 444 1730: Greetings Edoofa! We apologize for not being able to connect for our scheduled interview due to network challenges. We experienced technical difficulties that prevented messages to send in time. We understand the importance of this session and we sincerely regret any inconvenience this may have caused. We would appreciate the opportunity to reschedule the interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your understanding."
11/03/24, 10:08 am - Academic Board: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Anna who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
11/03/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 444 1730: Thank you for understanding. Yes, she gave me a pdf with parameters of the Scholarship.
11/03/24, 11:10 am - Academic Board: Okay so Solomon, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
11/03/24, 11:10 am - Academic Board: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
11/03/24, 4:38 pm - Academic Board: I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *8:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Time Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
11/03/24, 5:48 pm - +263 71 444 1730: Sorry, I couldn't get back to you in the specified time due to some pressure at work. I'm working as a garden boy at a Bible college from 7am up to 4pm everyday. But, I will try to do my best to be available tomorrow by 9:30am- mentioned time for our conversation. Thank you  for your understanding.

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
12/03/24, 9:33 am - +263 71 444 1730: Sure! Good morning.
12/03/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 541 5809: Precise. Thank you and good morning
12/03/24, 11:07 am - Academic Board: Alright so Solomon, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/03/24, 8:09 pm - Academic Board: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
