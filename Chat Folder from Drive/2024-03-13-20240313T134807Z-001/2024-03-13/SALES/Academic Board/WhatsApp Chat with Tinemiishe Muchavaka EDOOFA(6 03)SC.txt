How are you doing today ?
11/03/24, 4:35 pm - Academic Board: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
12/03/24, 9:03 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
12/03/24, 7:59 pm - Academic Board: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
12/03/24, 10:50 pm - +263 78 360 0605: Hie my dear. I'm Tinemiishe's mother. I'm really sorry to keep you waiting for so long. He travelled to another place to represent his school in some presentations. So I think where he is there's no network.
12/03/24, 10:52 pm - +263 78 360 0605: So if I can answer some of the questions, no problem, then he may answer the rest when he's back
12/03/24, 10:54 pm - +263 78 360 0605: Yes he is looking to such an opportunity for his career
