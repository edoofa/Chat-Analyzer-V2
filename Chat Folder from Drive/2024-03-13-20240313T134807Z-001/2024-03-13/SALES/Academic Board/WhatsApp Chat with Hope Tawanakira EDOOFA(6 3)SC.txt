*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/03/24, 8:55 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
09/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 241 1384: Good morning
09/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 241 1384: I’m fine thank you how are you
09/03/24, 11:14 am - Academic Board: I am fine thank you
09/03/24, 11:15 am - Academic Board: That is remarkable, Hope, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
09/03/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 241 1384: No we are not quite aware of that
09/03/24, 12:05 pm - Academic Board: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
09/03/24, 12:05 pm - Academic Board: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/03/24, 12:05 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 12:06 pm - Academic Board: Now you see Hope, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.
09/03/24, 12:06 pm - Academic Board: Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/03/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 241 1384: Alright I understand
11/03/24, 9:30 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
11/03/24, 4:35 pm - Academic Board: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
