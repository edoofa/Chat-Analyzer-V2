02/03/24, 1:02 pm - Academic Board: Good Morning Dear Parents and Huldah
I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 47/100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through! *I request  Parents and Student to be proactive so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.*
02/03/24, 1:04 pm - Academic Board: We understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Ok nice
02/03/24, 1:31 pm - Academic Board: Okay so Huldah, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.
02/03/24, 1:31 pm - Academic Board: *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/03/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 588 6145: But for now l can't get the scholarship because l have already failed the test right???
02/03/24, 1:47 pm - Academic Board: No, you haven't failed. You are eligible for the scholarship because you meet the criteria and requirements outlined in the application.
02/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Ok thank you
02/03/24, 1:52 pm - Academic Board: Alright so Huldah, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

11/03/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Yes l am ready
11/03/24, 4:28 pm - Academic Board: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*

11/03/24, 4:28 pm - Academic Board: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/03/24, 4:28 pm - Academic Board: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
11/03/24, 4:28 pm - Academic Board: However Huldah, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
11/03/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Ok l understood it
11/03/24, 4:39 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 588 6145: I am not familiar with it but looking forward to know more about the cycle
11/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Ok now l know
11/03/24, 4:44 pm - Academic Board: Alright Huldah, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
11/03/24, 4:45 pm - Academic Board: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
11/03/24, 4:45 pm - Academic Board: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
11/03/24, 4:49 pm - +263 78 588 6145: Yes thank you  now l understand the cycle
11/03/24, 4:51 pm - Academic Board: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
11/03/24, 4:51 pm - Academic Board: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/03/24, 4:51 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 4:52 pm - Academic Board: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/03/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 237 3756: It's understandable
11/03/24, 4:53 pm - Academic Board: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors
11/03/24, 4:53 pm - Academic Board: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
