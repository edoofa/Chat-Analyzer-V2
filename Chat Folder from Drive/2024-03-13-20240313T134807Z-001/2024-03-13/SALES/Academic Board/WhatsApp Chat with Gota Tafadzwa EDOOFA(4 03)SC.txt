05/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 489 3865: It was one of my alternatives
06/03/24, 9:00 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/03/24, 9:04 am - +263 71 769 9982: Good morning
06/03/24, 9:08 am - Academic Board: So does the course aligns with your career aspirations ?
06/03/24, 9:30 am - +263 71 521 2715: Do you offer Engineering courses coz thts wht my Son wants n Mechatronics Engineering to be exact
06/03/24, 9:42 am - Academic Board: Given that Mechatronics Engineering requires Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as compulsory subjects in A-levels, could you clarify why Tafadzwa pursued Computer Science instead of Chemistry in A-levels, considering his specific interest in Mechatronics?
06/03/24, 9:47 am - +263 71 521 2715: He did Mathematics Physics and Computer science
06/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 71 489 3865: If im correct mechatronics includes robotics and software engineering too?so isnt Computer science supposed to be an alternative for chemistry?
06/03/24, 10:24 am - Academic Board: Mechatronics Engineering indeed encompasses robotics and software engineering, it still necessitates a strong foundation in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. While Computer Science may provide some relevant skills, it doesn't substitute for Chemistry in any context. Tafadzwa's choice of subjects might align more closely with his interests and career aspirations, but it's essential to recognize that Chemistry holds its own significance within the framework of Mechatronics Engineering, particularly in areas such as materials science and control systems. That is the reason I suggested computer science engineering to Tafadzwa as it is more relatable to his career aspirations and subjects and also it holds more employment opportunity as 21st century is a digital era.
06/03/24, 2:59 pm - Academic Board: Are we connected ?
06/03/24, 4:32 pm - Academic Board: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
06/03/24, 4:40 pm - +263 71 769 9982: Ok noted

08/03/24, 3:14 pm - Academic Board: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
08/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 489 3865: I know for a fact that despite the high quality of education in india it is relatively cheaper there than most countries and ive heard that you have one of the best curriculum systems in the world,you are also in the top ten for the cheapest student visas in the world ,give for me shows your general concern for the student and not for profit <This message was edited>

08/03/24, 8:33 pm - +263 71 489 3865: Okay no problem
09/03/24, 8:53 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
09/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 489 3865: Im well hope you are too
09/03/24, 11:16 am - Academic Board: Okay well Tafadzwa, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
09/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 521 2715: Morning morning
09/03/24, 11:39 am - +263 71 489 3865: 1.Im going to be getting the best quality education in some of the best universities in the world so my confidence and moral going into the practical phase of my career will be high and im sure i will be prepared for any problem i will face in my career

2.I aim to get a good recommendation and i think any university in india will look good on my resume
09/03/24, 12:12 pm - Academic Board: That is remarkable,Tafadzwa. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
09/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 489 3865: No that i do not know
09/03/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 521 2715: Tht is wht exactly we want know Sir
09/03/24, 1:02 pm - Academic Board: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
09/03/24, 1:02 pm - Academic Board: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/03/24, 1:03 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 1:03 pm - Academic Board: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/03/24, 1:04 pm - Academic Board: Now you see Tafadzwa, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.
09/03/24, 1:04 pm - Academic Board: Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 489 3865: This is quite a remarkable system you have going on,im impressed

09/03/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 489 3865: Thank you sir
11/03/24, 9:30 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
11/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 489 3865: We are fine and you?

11/03/24, 10:53 am - Academic Board: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
11/03/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 489 3865: Yes
11/03/24, 11:13 am - Academic Board: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/03/24, 11:13 am - Academic Board: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/03/24, 11:13 am - Academic Board: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/03/24, 11:14 am - Academic Board: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/03/24, 11:14 am - Academic Board: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
11/03/24, 11:14 am - Academic Board: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/03/24, 11:14 am - Academic Board: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?

12/03/24, 9:05 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*
