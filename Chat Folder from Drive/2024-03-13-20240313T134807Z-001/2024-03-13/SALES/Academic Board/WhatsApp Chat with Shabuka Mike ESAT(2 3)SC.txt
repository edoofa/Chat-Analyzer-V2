04/03/24, 12:19 pm - Academic Board: Good Morning Dear Parents and Mike
I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 46/100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through!
04/03/24, 12:20 pm - Academic Board: I hope you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program shared at venue of ESAT'24 ?
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
04/03/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 679 8550: Good day, Is it possible for you to send us the brochures and the flyers so that we help him in program selection. Also with the mark that Mike attained what are you offering him in terms of scholarship percentage?
04/03/24, 12:52 pm - Academic Board: Did Mike not share the brochures and Flyers with you which were handed over to Mike during the ESAT exam in the Venue?
04/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 679 8550: From the exams they went straight to school, we have not met with him from there
04/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 679 8550: We will however try and get the brochure from him if you cannot send
04/03/24, 1:26 pm - Academic Board: Let me share them with you and you can take 10 minutes to go through them .
04/03/24, 1:26 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>

04/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 679 8550: Whats your cutting points for Law?
04/03/24, 2:03 pm - Academic Board: The scholarship cutoff isn't solely determined by points; for law, 6-9 points are also taken into consideration. However, we encourage our students to aim for 15 points. Following the pandemic, we observed a significant infrastructure gap in Africa, prompting us to make the criteria more flexible, accepting 2 passes in A-levels. Apart from A-level results, various other factors are also considered.and student also have to go through the Interview.
04/03/24, 2:03 pm - Academic Board: Okay so Mike, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 5:38 am - +263 71 487 3139: Goodmorning Mr Singh I understand that my ESAT score is a factor in determining my scholarship award . However  I would like to emphasize my other achievements and ask if it is still possible for me to receive a high level of scholarship since my Estat results were  not as high as I had hoped and I have consistently performed well in my previous studies and I have the full support of my parents .
05/03/24, 8:44 am - Academic Board: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*
