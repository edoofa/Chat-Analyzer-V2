02/03/24, 10:00 am - Academic Board: Good Morning Dear Parents and Takudzwa,

I understand that you were a part of the grand event and presentation by the esteemed Founders of the Edoofa Program Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh. 

*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 45 /100*


Congratulations for Sailing Through! *I request you to your Parents to be proactive so that we continue with the Counseling Session with you and your Family.*
02/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 119 6626: Oky sir
02/03/24, 12:15 pm - Academic Board: We understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 7:32 pm - +260 776551492: Thank you.We would like to hear more from you
04/03/24, 8:42 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
I hope you are doing well !@263781196626 @260776551492 @16475230938 
Takudzwa, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/03/24, 8:42 am - Academic Board: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 11:49 am - +260 776551492: Are these counselling sessions done online?
04/03/24, 12:17 pm - Academic Board: Certainly, prior to this, the seminar and test were conducted offline in Zimbabwe, which Takudzwa attended. Currently, interviews are being conducted online.
04/03/24, 1:13 pm - +260 776551492: Yes we do have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:
*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.
*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.
*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

09/03/24, 8:52 am - Academic Board: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
09/03/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 119 6626: I am perfectly fine and you sir?
09/03/24, 9:37 am - Academic Board: I am fine thank you
09/03/24, 9:37 am - Academic Board: Did you understand the course?
11/03/24, 9:28 am - Academic Board: Good morning
 I've observed that my messages have been read but not responded to. Is everything alright?
11/03/24, 9:29 am - +260 776551492: Good morning How are you doing
11/03/24, 9:34 am - Academic Board: I am fine thank you
11/03/24, 9:34 am - Academic Board: Can you please answer this ?
11/03/24, 9:35 am - +260 776551492: I'm sure she has some kind of an idea,perhaps you can enlighten us more on that
11/03/24, 9:50 am - Academic Board: Did you manage to go through the course?
11/03/24, 10:01 am - +260 776551492: Yeah
11/03/24, 10:54 am - Academic Board: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/03/24, 10:54 am - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 10:54 am - Academic Board: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/03/24, 10:55 am - Academic Board: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/03/24, 10:55 am - Academic Board: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/03/24, 11:57 am - +260 776551492: Amazing,thank you for this opportunity and great offer.
11/03/24, 11:57 am - +260 776551492: What's the next step for me?
11/03/24, 12:07 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 12:35 pm - +260 776551492: Yes it was quite evident
Thanks for sharing,it's very helpful.

11/03/24, 1:27 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 1:29 pm - +260 776551492: I didn't explain in depth but if possible you can explain it in depth
11/03/24, 1:30 pm - +260 776551492: Yes I'm ready
11/03/24, 1:41 pm - Academic Board: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*

11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Academic Board: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Academic Board: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
11/03/24, 1:42 pm - Academic Board: However Takudzwa as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
11/03/24, 1:45 pm - +260 776551492: When does that process begin?
11/03/24, 1:45 pm - +260 776551492: Well noted
11/03/24, 1:50 pm - Academic Board: When will you complete your A level ?
11/03/24, 1:51 pm - +260 776551492: In the month of November
11/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 119 6626: Understood Sir
11/03/24, 2:58 pm - Academic Board: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/03/24, 3:29 pm - +260 776551492: Not really
11/03/24, 3:52 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 3:53 pm - Academic Board: Alright Takudzwa, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
11/03/24, 3:53 pm - Academic Board: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
11/03/24, 3:53 pm - Academic Board: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*
