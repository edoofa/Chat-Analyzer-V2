*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
06/03/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 557 0962: Good morning
06/03/24, 9:43 am - Academic Board: Yes please discuss about course during later stages .
06/03/24, 9:44 am - Academic Board: Okay so, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
06/03/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 557 0962: Absolutely
06/03/24, 10:51 am - Academic Board: Alright, @263775570962 @263775969636 , to facilitate your integration into our vibrant student community, we'd like to begin with your introduction.

As a parent responding on behalf of your child, could you please provide us with some insight into your child's background, education, intended field of study, strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background?

Additionally, we would appreciate learning more about your work as parents. Where do you currently work (location), and in which specific field or profession do you specialize? This information will help us better understand your family's background and your child's circumstances. Thank you for your cooperation.
06/03/24, 4:30 pm - Academic Board: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/03/24, 8:26 am - +263 77 557 0962: Hello. Bear with us, work can be demanding and replies may then become sluggish. Will try to respond as promptly as possible
07/03/24, 8:26 am - +263 77 557 0962: *Insight into Talent' background.*
Talent is the last born in a family  of 4 children. He is quite active in academic and sports and has had outstanding achievements in both categories. He has represented his schools at Primary school and Secondary. At Primary, he excelled in the field of volleyball and athletics - notable in track short and middle distances up scaling the heights of School, zonal and district completions while at secondary He has been recognized up to district level and church run games. At academic level He has performed above average from his Primary and secondary levels. He has shown commendable academic results in English, Sciences and other Humanities like Geography, and History. He has shiwn outstanding leadership skills at both Primary and Secondary school where he was selected prefect and now is a High school Headboy in his final year at high school.
Talent has passion for supporting his church in various categories such as church servers(assisting the Priests in Mass proceedings and missal readings), choir and all liturgical issues ( ways of praying) and teaching other young religious persons various methodologies in the church.
Talent is still going to school and is now in his final or high school leaving year where he is doing Advanced level studies specializing in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and English and Communication skills (Subsidiary English Language).
Talent intends to study Science oriented areas, specifically Pharmacy. He plans to contribute to the Health related issues that may benefit his society and country and the medical field at large. His greatest strength is the belief that he can achieve a lot if given an opportunity and support as well as the spirit to work harder to get his intended goals as he is a goal getter who does not give up despite challenges he might encounter. He believes in himself and we assisted him to believe he can be the best in everything he chooses to do. His weakest area I think is not leaving anything to chance and becoming too attached or occupied with a task till completion which I think might be overwhelming without knowing it and sometimes we have to counsel him in that regard.
Talent likes sporting activities like basketball and volleyball. His greatest passion is in basketball and dreams of playing the game sometime in his life. He also has great passion for computers and computer related technologies. 
The family,  as earlier stated, has 4 children - 1 girl and 3 boys and both parents are still alive. The father and mother are communal members who survive on seasonal farming growing mainly food crops and rearing chickens, goats and turkeys. In a good year,  some extras are sold at local markets for the general upkeep of the family .
The family runs a fairly small communal land left by the late grandparents and ownership of the land is local rural Council. This is the main source of finance and savings can range from soft loans to communal money saving ventures commonly called 'mukando' where members take turns to get contributions of savings  over an agreed period.
The father augments the said income from work as a rural school teacher in Mudzi district( earning a gross salary of $120.00) and the mother is a house wife. The amount is hardly adequate to feed, clothe and provide for  the family of six and the inflationary environment has worsened the situation.
07/03/24, 9:18 am - Academic Board: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
07/03/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 596 9636: Amen to that.

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education

08/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 596 9636: Pharmacy has been my passion since the days of my late great uncle who used to practice traditional medication and would fail to heal some ailments like malaria. It was a challenge that drove me to look into the possibility of augmenting the traditional knowledge with modern medicines and this way we may solve some of the 
Illnesses and diseases. Also, l have witnesses several village men and women succum ing to some diseases due to absence of medicines. This has motivated me to contribute to the field of pharmacy as reducing the pain, suffering and deaths of loved ones is traumatizing.

In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
11/03/24, 4:08 pm - Academic Board: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
11/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 596 9636: I do. Thank you very much. It is pretty much clear to follow.
11/03/24, 4:09 pm - Academic Board: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
11/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 596 9636: I understand thank you
11/03/24, 4:10 pm - Academic Board: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 596 9636: Thank you
11/03/24, 4:12 pm - Academic Board: <Media omitted>

11/03/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 596 9636: For now l am happy with the responses.  Thank you
11/03/24, 4:14 pm - Academic Board: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/03/24, 4:14 pm - Academic Board: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
