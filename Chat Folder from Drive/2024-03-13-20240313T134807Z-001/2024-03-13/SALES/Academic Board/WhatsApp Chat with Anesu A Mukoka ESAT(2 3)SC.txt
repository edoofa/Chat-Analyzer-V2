To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation.

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 73 423 3124: Good day
I think it will be useful to do the session with the child, he is at a boarding school. We will him during the holidays. Currently I am at work.
05/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 73 423 3124: He showed us the flyers and we have gone through it
05/03/24, 10:13 am - Academic Board: Okay so Anesu, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 73 423 3124: Noted, will reserve the message for him.
05/03/24, 11:18 am - Academic Board: Alright, @263734233124 @263772878272 , to facilitate your integration into our vibrant student community, we'd like to begin with your introduction.

As a parent responding on behalf of your child, could you please provide us with some insight into your child's background, education, intended field of study, strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background?

Additionally, we would appreciate learning more about your work as parents. Where do you currently work (location), and in which specific field or profession do you specialize? This information will help us better understand your family's background and your child's circumstances. Thank you for your cooperation.
