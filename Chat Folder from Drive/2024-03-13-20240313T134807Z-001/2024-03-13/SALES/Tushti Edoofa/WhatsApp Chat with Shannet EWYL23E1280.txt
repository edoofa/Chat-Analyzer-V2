28/2/24, 8:55 AM - +263 77 324 8242: I am Mrs Kerina Chibura mother of Shannet

I can see that  Shannet is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
28/2/24, 8:58 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/2/24, 9:01 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Can you please explain them
28/2/24, 9:01 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/2/24, 9:01 AM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/2/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Noted with thanks
28/2/24, 9:10 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/2/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 066 7844: I am glad to know them
28/2/24, 9:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear!
28/2/24, 9:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/2/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 066 7844: I have gone through it now..... Thank you
28/2/24, 9:17 AM - +263 78 066 7844: We can connect on Mondays and Thursdays

It is so interesting
28/2/24, 9:21 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Shanet for now we will be connecting on every Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 9.30am for our initial orientation days. After the orientation I will let you know about this schedule.
28/2/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 066 7844: It's alright
28/2/24, 9:25 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay Shannet! lets continue
28/2/24, 9:25 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/2/24, 10:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

1/3/24, 9:04 AM - Tushti Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
1/3/24, 9:05 AM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
1/3/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Go ahead
1/3/24, 9:05 AM - Tushti Edoofa: A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
1/3/24, 9:06 AM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SHANNET/JULIA*
1/3/24, 9:06 AM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
1/3/24, 9:06 AM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
1/3/24, 9:07 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

1/3/24, 9:11 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Perfect Shannet!
1/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
1/3/24, 9:13 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
1/3/24, 10:37 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
1/3/24, 10:58 AM - Tushti Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where they can add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

2/3/24, 10:02 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Dear Parents,
Greetings to you @263772244216 @263773248242 ! Today, as you already know there won't be any sessions scheduled for Shannet. Instead, we'd like to take this opportunity to connect with you. 
I am sure that you must have had a chance to go through the conversations that I had with Shannet until now and that must have given you a certain clarity towards the program. I wanted to utilize this opportunity to understand from a parent’s perspective, what are your expectations from Shannet through the EWYL program and how you plan to keep a check on her progress regularly.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
2/3/24, 10:05 AM - +263 77 224 4216: Good morning how are you
2/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 77 324 8242: Morning how are you,
2/3/24, 10:23 AM - +263 77 324 8242: Personally EWYL program is quite good since it's will help to lessen the cost however form the area we live there is network challenges there is no WIFI. I check on her progress regularly.. Yesterday she managed to open a Google account to search for companies. Then on the issue of school head's phone number we are still looking for it.
2/3/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Good morning
I have the Chiredzi Government High Head Mr Zvada  and Deputy Head Mr Gudo 's number , what is the next step
2/3/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 066 7844: They said I should use both of them
2/3/24, 12:57 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am doing well, Dear Parent. Thank you for asking. I hope the same with you.
Please excuse me for the delay in getting back to you, I was caught up in a meeting that had gotten extended.

I do understand how network challenges could be quite tricky considering the projects require technological intervention most of the times. However, I appreciate the fact that you are involved in Shannet's EWYL journey, which would help both of us to keep a regular check on her progress and future aspirations. <This message was edited>
2/3/24, 1:01 PM - Tushti Edoofa: As per your query, I had informed above that the first project, the Corporate Alliance one is currently on hold as we have other projects that require greater participation and are more tangible in terms of the outcomes from the students. Which means, that Shannet will be able to expedite her process of earning scholarship credits slightly better when she is working on the other two with the same amount of effort.

As Shannet is in her initial days of the EWYL program, the difficulty level of the project might not be most suitable for this timeline. However, I deeply appreciate the fact that you are collectively helping her perform on the same.
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Hello Shannet
Happy to see you begin working on the projects. This shows your willingness and intent towards the program and your goals.

Shannet, I just checked our records, and it seems like Chiredzi High school is already one of our partners. To help you ease out the process of finding which particular schools are already connected with us, we could do a small activity. Why don't you share the list of at least 8-10 schools in your area and I can help you identify the ones that are partnered with us.  This will help us save the resolution time and you can go about connecting with the headmasters of the schools that are yet to be connected with us.
2/3/24, 1:06 PM - Tushti Edoofa: How does that sound to you?
2/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 066 7844: It's alright

Chiredzi Christian high school
Mazungunye High School
Chilonga high school
Chigwedziva high school

Those are the only schools which are nearer
2/3/24, 4:37 PM - +263 78 066 7844: Good afternoon
I have found another school to connect with , which is Birivenge High School. The school head is Mr Joe Chitumba . His phone numbers are 0772244942 and 0719750237
4/3/24, 9:11 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Dear Shannet I have checked our school lists, seems like these listed schools are not connected with us, so you can start connecting with them.
4/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
4/3/24, 9:12 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

6/3/24, 10:57 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Dear Shannet
When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to form a WhatsApp where the student adds  Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them <This message was edited>

9/3/24, 8:00 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Good morning! Shannet 🌅

9/3/24, 9:25 AM - +263 77 324 8242: Good morning Ms Julia how are you doing today
9/3/24, 9:32 AM - Tushti Edoofa: I am doing absolutely good. Thank you for asking.
9/3/24, 9:49 AM - Tushti Edoofa: So dear Shannet Today I am going to discuss with you regarding the project.
9/3/24, 9:49 AM - Tushti Edoofa: First, let me know what is the update regarding the project. And what are the challenges you are facing?
9/3/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Morning how are you doing today
9/3/24, 9:59 AM - +263 78 066 7844: The challenge I am facing is that the school I have found in my research their school fees ranges from $60 -$80 so  I am still looking for the school to work with
9/3/24, 10:04 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
9/3/24, 10:07 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Meanwhile you can focus on community building project also. For this project you can contact with your friends. If they are willing you can share the form with them.
9/3/24, 10:07 AM - Tushti Edoofa: You can explain your journey.
9/3/24, 10:08 AM - Tushti Edoofa: Remember:
1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
9/3/24, 10:11 AM - Tushti Edoofa: When you get the form, the forms are sent to the counseling team and the counseling team will reach out to the student.
9/3/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Noted
9/3/24, 10:19 AM - Tushti Edoofa: You can read the whole community building project requirement and start working on that. If you focus only on one project then the credits cannot be gained easily. I recommend you to actively participate in community building project also. I will be there to assist you.
9/3/24, 12:31 PM - +263 78 066 7844: It's alright.. thank you
9/3/24, 12:35 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I have already shared with you certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our previous students!
9/3/24, 12:35 PM - Tushti Edoofa: You remember?
9/3/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 066 7844: Yes I do
9/3/24, 12:43 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Through the watts app group. The main purpose behind forming the group is that you _reach out to a large pool of students so that you can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
9/3/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 066 7844: It's alright
9/3/24, 12:44 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Okay Shannet!
12/3/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 066 7844: Greetings to you all
12/3/24, 10:52 AM - +263 78 066 7844: I found almost 20 students who are willing to be part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program
