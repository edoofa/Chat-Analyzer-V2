08/03/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
08/03/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 433 8419: Noted sir
08/03/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 433 8419: Thank you so much let me share this with my parents sir
08/03/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: However Acclaim, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
08/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 433 8419: Okay sir noted
08/03/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
08/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 433 8419: No sir can you brief me about that.
08/03/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Acclaim, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
08/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/03/24, 1:40 pm - +263 71 433 8419: Noted sir thank you
08/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
08/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/03/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
08/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 433 8419: Thank you sir , l will ask questions sir after liaise with my parents.
08/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
08/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
