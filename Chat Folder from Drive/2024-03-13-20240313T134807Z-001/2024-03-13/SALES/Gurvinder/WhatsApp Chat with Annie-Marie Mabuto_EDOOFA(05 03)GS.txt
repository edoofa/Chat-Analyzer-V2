05/03/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I'm online now sir
05/03/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/03/24, 12:44 pm - +263 71 266 0684: I was told by my child l knew nothing about it. 

Annie - Marie is the one who told me
05/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 266 0684: It's okay Mr Gurvinder
05/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 965 5738: The Edoofa scholarship programme is a scholarship programe initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions that solves the affordability  problem for students in order to pursue higher education. It provides an earn while you learn programme for the to enable students to not only learn practical skills but also prepare for their future employability.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir that's it <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Annie, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes, I have everything it takes to get this scholarship
05/03/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Annie, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

I am passionate about using the law to ensure fair and just outcomes for individuals accused of crimes, as well as to protect the rights of victims. I am drawn to the challenging and dynamic nature of criminal law, as it requires critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to navigate complex legal issues. I am committed to using my legal education to defend individuals accused of crimes, ensure that justice is served, and work towards improving the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system.
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble cause.
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Your lifelong dream and passion for making a positive impact on your community are truly inspiring. Your commitment to advocating for others, particularly those who may not have a voice, reflects a deep sense of justice and empathy.

05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/03/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir I am very confident in achieving it, I'm working very hard towards passing

05/03/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Annie I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I'm willing to give in 2000% if needed sir
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Studying abroad offers a unique opportunity to experience a different culture, gain a global perspective, access high-quality education, enhance career prospects with international experience, and develop language skills and personal growth that may not be as readily available in my home country.
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 965 5738: If given the opportunity to study abroad through this scholarship, I plan to bring back the knowledge, skills, and global perspectives gained from my international education to contribute towards enhancing the education system in my country. This would involve sharing best practices and advocating for educational reforms that align with global standards to elevate the quality of education in my country.
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Annie, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I agree to that sir <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/03/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I wonder why
05/03/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

05/03/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now Annie, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I think I have understood enough sir, but can I ask, after completing the course is it mandatory to return to the home country
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can work in India too.
05/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Okay sir that's all
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I've made my Research about foreign education but most of the applications require A-level results so I haven't found any that is suitable for now
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I once checked and it was around 6 lakhs
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Which is maybe 6 000 US
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I've gone through it sir
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/03/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir
05/03/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Annie, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I'm done now sir
05/03/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/03/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

05/03/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 4:38 pm - +263 71 965 5738: The Earn While You Learn program not only alleviates the financial burden on students but also serves as a valuable opportunity to gain practical work experience while pursuing their education. This allows students to earn income through part-time work, providing them with real-world exposure and skills that complement their academic studies making them a good choice for employment . By engaging in work alongside their studies, students can apply theoretical knowledge to their, practical skills, develop essential skills, and build a professional network all before they officially graduate making it easier for them to find jobs after that . I believe I will benefit because it will provide me with necessary skills and experience which will enable me to know how life will be after university and also raise my chances of being employed.
06/03/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Good afternoon sir
06/03/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Annie, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I understood sir
06/03/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/03/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 965 5738: It's really been something I've been looking for
06/03/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Annie, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes they are going to be the ones
06/03/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I have discussed with them and they said they'll provide what I need
06/03/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 1:40 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I'm ready
06/03/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Annie as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 71 965 5738: About 1500-2000
06/03/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Annie, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/03/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Okay so I have to pay this amount to be admitted to the program?
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I think so
06/03/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 965 5738: How do you pass the eligibility check
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Annie basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
06/03/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
06/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Okay sir I understand, that's better
06/03/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I am familiar with it
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Annie, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program. <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I understand
06/03/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir, so when can I do step two
06/03/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/03/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/03/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 965 5738: Okay sir thank u
12/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 965 5738: When
12/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 266 0684: Noted
12/03/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 266 0684: After paying enrolment fees l send the scanned receipts through this platform or will get the email addresses for you and Mr Maphosa
12/03/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Please when the admission team will contact you after confirming the completion of the enrollment process.
12/03/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Please you can share the pictures of the receipt directly in this group.
12/03/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 266 0684: Wonderful.
12/03/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
12/03/24, 10:46 am - +263 71 266 0684: Roughly from your experience with Zim students, ihow much is the cost of plane tick to India and Visa
12/03/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
12/03/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
12/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 71 266 0684: Well said thank you.
12/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in the Edoofa Acceptance letter?
12/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 71 965 5738: March 18 for the 200 and  April 18 for the remaining 150
12/03/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: So are you aware of the transaction methods as well please?
12/03/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes to contact Mr Maposa who is the principal of Chibuwe High
12/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 71 266 0684: Noted. The idea is to be informed
12/03/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
12/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Number 2
12/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
12/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
12/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
