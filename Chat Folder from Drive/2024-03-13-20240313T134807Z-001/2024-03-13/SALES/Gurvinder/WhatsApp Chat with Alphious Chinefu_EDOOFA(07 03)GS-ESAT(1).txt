08/03/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
08/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes
08/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Alphious, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.
Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes sir
08/03/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Alphious, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.

08/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes sir
09/03/24, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
09/03/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Good afternoon sorry for not being available the place l was,   was out of service
09/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 836 3376: If l am to get the career option in my point of view  five years after completion of course l want to build my own pharmacies  in towns and small branches in rural areas since most people focus on urban and ignore the rural side . But as for me growing up in the rural you go to town to get some other drugs and was always a challenge fir the elderly to travel long distances , so l would like to improve on that bring the medicine closer to the people who live in the country side. If l am to be very succesful ,  l learned at low priviledged that hardly had practical science laboratory equipment so l always wanted to start a school in the long run but first l wanted ti improve the rural school l attented in whatever l can it might be by buying stationary and laboratory equipment basically anything to make their learning efficient. But my biggest was to focus on rural devlopment l would love other investments like shop and put the necessities in town to rural areas
09/03/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Alphious, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/03/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes l amm ready to give it my all

09/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Sorry l added another my phone is running out of  and far from so l will replying with that number till l get home
09/03/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/03/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
09/03/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 836 3376: no l wasn't aware
09/03/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Didn't you attend the Meet and Greet?
09/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 836 3376: I did but l didnt get there early so the meeting was over when l got there
09/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
09/03/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes l am motivated
09/03/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Alphious, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
09/03/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes
09/03/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes
09/03/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
09/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Okay what is SLICE CON
09/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Please, *SLICE  - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embark on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs.
09/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Okay l understand
09/03/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/03/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
09/03/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
09/03/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: However Alphious, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
09/03/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Okay l understand
09/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/03/24, 3:30 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Not really sure but is it the same as the Studentd Journey with Edoofa Program
09/03/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Alphious, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
09/03/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Yes sirp
09/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 836 3376: Sir
11/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/03/24, 5:02 pm - +263 71 836 3376: So the registration fee is not part of the annual fee
11/03/24, 5:03 pm - +263 71 836 3376: And the anual is only paid in two installed for the next four years or maybe its just when you start
11/03/24, 8:20 pm - ~ alphioustchinefu added +263 78 680 0297
