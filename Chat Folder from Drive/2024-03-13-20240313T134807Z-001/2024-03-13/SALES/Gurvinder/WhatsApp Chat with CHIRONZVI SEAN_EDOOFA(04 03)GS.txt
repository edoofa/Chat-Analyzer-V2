*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

04/03/24, 5:44 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes I am Sean Chironzvi
05/03/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
05/03/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 293 1151: Good morning
05/03/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Sean, Mr and Mrs Chironzvi,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/03/24, 9:47 am - +263 77 293 1151: Ok
05/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Chironzvi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Trish, is that correct?
05/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 293 1151: Yes
05/03/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Trish, also do tell me whether you learnt about Trish’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/03/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 293 1151: Trish is well educated through edoofa program , l have learn this program is good for students
05/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chironzvi, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 293 1151: Yes
05/03/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Now Sean, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

07/03/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Sean I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
07/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes Sir I work hard
07/03/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Okay the reason is there many people and many friends of mine that have diplomas but where are they right now ...... Like the others are now truck drivers but they have diplomas and some are even selling till operators in some very very small business and their salary can not even meet the needs and wants of them and to those who do their studies abroad are achieving something in life and are the owners of the very very small business that the ones who studied in Zimbabwe are being till operator of ..so I think it will help me to change my background if I study abroad
07/03/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
07/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 71 204 0425: I will clearly support the poly technicals so that they will
07/03/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sean, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
07/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 204 0425: sorry I didn't complete the massage
07/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Let me continue it

07/03/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sean, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
07/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 204 0425: It is good but as for now if u learn in those poly technicals you not go anywhere rather than those who study abroad...and now to get reputed personality you have to be someone in life ..if I say someone I mean you have to be kind of successful
07/03/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
07/03/24, 2:21 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes that's it
07/03/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

07/03/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now Sean, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
07/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 204 0425: So what are the requirements for a student like me to get quality of higher education that Edoofa aims
07/03/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you that in order to be found eligible for the Edoofa scholarship program you need to clear the eligibility procedures 
The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-
-Interview call with the Program Mentor
-Scholarship Test(Online/Offline)
-Final interview with Program Manager(via WhatsApp voice notes from a different interview group)

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, etc would be evaluated!
07/03/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Okay I understand it now
07/03/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/03/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 204 0425: No I never applied to any University abroad
07/03/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
07/03/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 204 0425: I have never researched on that and even my parents never researched either
07/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/03/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Okay so if I get a scholarship and do the Earn while you Learn program what will be the annual fee
07/03/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
07/03/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes you can
07/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Sean, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Okay sir it is now clear to me
07/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/03/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

07/03/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
07/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes it will surely help me because as to me I think there's an extraordinaryness to be an Edoofian because it is of higher education
07/03/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Sean, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Ohh thanks for this example it is more understandable than the first explanation
07/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 204 0425: so it is very affordable right ??
07/03/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/03/24, 4:15 pm - +263 71 204 0425: yaaah you got me .. that's exactly what I was looking for
07/03/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sean, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
07/03/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes they will be supporting me for my my higher education
07/03/24, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
07/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Um not yet
07/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 204 0425: But since I now know the financial aspect I think we are going to discuss about it
07/03/24, 8:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Let us connect at 10:00 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session

Stay Blessed!
07/03/24, 8:44 pm - +263 71 204 0425: You Mr
07/03/24, 8:47 pm - +263 71 204 0425: I mean stay blessed too
08/03/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
09/03/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
09/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 204 0425: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
09/03/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 204 0425: Yes I'm ready
09/03/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Sean as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/03/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 204 0425: The student would end up spend between $1500- $2250
09/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 204 0425: So is this the reason why students are applying for Edoofa
09/03/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Sean, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/03/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 204 0425: So the fee will be paid before you get a scholarship
09/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Please, the enrollment fees is paid only after you are found eligible for the program.
09/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 71 204 0425: Yeah thats it
09/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 204 0425: So how can I be an eligible student
09/03/24, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Let me tell you that in order to be found eligible for the Edoofa scholarship program you need to clear the eligibility procedures 
The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-
-Interview call with the Program Mentor
-Scholarship Test(Online/Offline)
-Final interview with Program Manager(via WhatsApp voice notes from a different interview group)

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, etc would be evaluated!
09/03/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 204 0425: Okay
09/03/24, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/03/24, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
09/03/24, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/03/24, 11:08 am - +263 71 204 0425: Oh this makes it more affordable
09/03/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 204 0425: No I know I nothing about the cycle
09/03/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Alright Sean, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
09/03/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 71 204 0425: Yes I understood
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
09/03/24, 1:42 pm - +263 71 204 0425: No
09/03/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
09/03/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
09/03/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

11/03/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Hello @263712040425 @263779535289 @263772931151.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
11/03/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 204 0425: Sorry sir I have a lesson after breakfast
11/03/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 204 0425: That is at 11 :00
11/03/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Are you available now?
11/03/24, 5:37 pm - +263 77 953 5289: We are good to proceed
11/03/24, 10:21 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/03/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 10:28 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
13/03/24, 5:16 am - +263 71 204 0425: Good morning Sir I'm very sorry for not responding in the past 2 days but today I will be available at 12:00 am
