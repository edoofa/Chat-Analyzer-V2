16/02/24, 11:29 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/02/24, 8:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
17/02/24, 9:08 am - +263 78 478 4290: Okay Mr Gurvinder
17/02/24, 9:13 am - +263 78 478 4290: I learnt that this program is education for all,it is also a scholarship program for all and it was initiated by Edutrain solutions pvt . ltd india, it also accessible to all and not just the privilege and it solves our problems which include lack of affordability and employability in higher education
17/02/24, 9:14 am - +263 78 478 4290: Enoch didn't not tell me
17/02/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 478 4290: I wanted to do medicine there but it not possible due to my results but l would like but tu guide n tell me which program will be suitable n will l get a place there
17/02/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 478 4290: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
17/02/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder
17/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Sicelo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes l can n will try my best
17/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 478 4290: I think we are having communication problem whenever u are online l will be off and vice versa

20/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder

20/02/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yeah it is a good course
20/02/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand it?
20/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yeah l understood Mr Gurvinder and thank you
20/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Having gone through the Contents of the programme l believe that the course will help me in empowering the community with much needed help in desease awareness in areas where healthcare is scarce. Also it is an opportunity worth trying for other less privileged children to pursue in order to participate in their wellness .This gives an opportunity to be proactive in desease control for communities where pandemics may occur ,l would contribute data and knowledge needed to curb such occurrences. Liaison with Key Stake holders would help in averting  diseases as l will be a major player in data analysis and information supply. I would also dedicate my time in improving the preservation of specimen for testing as many a time results are forfeited due to improper preservation or untimely handling of tests.
20/02/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Sicelo I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder
20/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/02/24, 4:18 pm - +263 78 478 4290: It provides me with new unique opportunities to see more of the world ,also experience new perspectives and work with different people and learn different languages
20/02/24, 7:54 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Further more,it opens up doors to experience other cultures rather than being confined to the little that you were exposed to when growing up.
22/02/24, 8:01 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
22/02/24, 8:03 am - +263 78 478 4290: Its oky Mt Gurvinder
22/02/24, 8:03 am - +263 78 478 4290: Morning
22/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 78 478 4290: God willing,Scholarships are rare opportunities which should be cherished for that l would also partner with organisations like yours (Edoorfa) to encourage the opening up of our learning culture as you are aware that currently our system of learning is pourous with only Zimsec being offered in all government schools with a few who are privileged who can afford Cambridge . An exchange programme would be beneficially in that we get exposed to education systems employed abroad hence we need to adapt to the global standards of learning,by also challenging our traditional way of thinking which lead to better focus and improved academic performances
22/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sicelo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
22/02/24, 9:04 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
23/02/24, 7:23 am - +263 78 478 4290: I do agree ,thus once l benefit from your scholarship l will gain exposure and it will be a confidence booster to nevigate within my community and be an influence for change in our education system.Certainly a conducive atmosphere always brings the best out of individuals Sir.
23/02/24, 7:25 am - +263 78 478 4290: I do experience network problems this side and l am currently using a 3G device.
23/02/24, 8:42 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

23/02/24, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

23/02/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

23/02/24, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Please, there are two. <This message was edited>
23/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 478 4290: Okay thank you Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 478 4290: Nope and none of my family members
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Okay this is wonderful
23/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Sicelo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 478 4290: I pray that l will be among the selected
23/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Wow its a nice program and l see why india is recommended as higher education destination
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/02/24, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

23/02/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 478 4290: I think what they are doing is great as they say you to make use of the opportunity and come up with a solid plan so that everything can turn up to be the best ,so l think l think they are using the opportunities and everything is coming out great and yes it will greatly benefit me as l will also get an opportunity in knowing my capabilities
23/02/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Sicelo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Okay wow l didn't know
23/02/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder, does the EWYL program start when you are accepted or I can join even now
23/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Please it starts after you enroll with the program.
23/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sicelo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Definately Sir
23/02/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Yes Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Sicelo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 478 4290: $1 500-$1 750
23/02/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Sicelo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/02/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Ok much appreciated
23/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Let me discuss this with my parents and will inform you on the Admission intake l would have chosen.
23/02/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please finish the counselling session today, after that I will give you time to do so.
23/02/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: The session is of just 15 minutes more.
23/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Certainly it appears easier with no hassles
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 478 4290: It's ok continue.
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Understood
23/02/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Nope
23/02/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sicelo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/02/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 478 4290: I have gone through the cycle and well understood.
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
23/02/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Basically l have to wait for a response from a particular University offering my preferred programme before processing my travelling documents.
23/02/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, but the Universities reply in a week or two, not more than that.
23/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 478 4290: Okay
23/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
23/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/02/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
