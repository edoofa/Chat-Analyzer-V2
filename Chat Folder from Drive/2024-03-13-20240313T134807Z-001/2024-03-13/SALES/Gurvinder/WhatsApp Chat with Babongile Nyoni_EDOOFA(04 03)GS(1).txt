You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/03/24, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
05/03/24, 9:14 am - +263 71 748 5999: Good morning
05/03/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Babongile, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Thandoluhle, is that correct?
05/03/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 748 5999: Yes sir/ma'am
05/03/24, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: Please, it is Sir.
05/03/24, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Thandoluhle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Thandoluhle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/03/24, 9:46 am - +263 71 748 5999: I just registered and she didn't tell me the journey
05/03/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
05/03/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/03/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/03/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 9:51 am - +263 71 748 5999: Yes very much
So what do I need to do?
05/03/24, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Babongile, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 748 5999: Yes
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Now Babongile, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?

Don’t you agree?
06/03/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes I do...
06/03/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes
06/03/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

06/03/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now Babongile, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 748 5999: No, everything is cler
06/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Clear
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
06/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes
06/03/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: May I know for which University in which country?
06/03/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 748 5999: No,I did research,I didn't apply though
06/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 748 5999: No
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/03/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Okay great
06/03/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/03/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes please
06/03/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Babongile, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 748 5999: I see
06/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

06/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/03/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 748 5999: I think it will benefit me a lot
06/03/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Babongile, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 5:22 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Okay
06/03/24, 9:30 pm - Gurvinder: *Let us connect at 10:00 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session

Stay Blessed!
06/03/24, 9:36 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Sure
07/03/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
07/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 748 5999: We are online sir
07/03/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/03/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/03/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/03/24, 8:41 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
08/03/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
08/03/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 748 5999: I'm back online,sorry electricity has been gone for a while now
08/03/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Is the issue resolved?
08/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 71 748 5999: No,but I am charging my phone at my mother's work
08/03/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, when will you be available?
08/03/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 748 5999: I will update sir
08/03/24, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/03/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
09/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Okay
09/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Morning
09/03/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/03/24, 7:32 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes
11/03/24, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the session, I would like you to complete your session today or I would have to close your application.
11/03/24, 10:22 am - +263 71 748 5999: Okay,let's complete it then
11/03/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Babongile as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 71 748 5999: 1500
11/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 71 748 5999: At least
11/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Babongile, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/03/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 748 5999: When is it due
11/03/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: I will explain, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 748 5999: Yes I do
11/03/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/03/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
11/03/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/03/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
11/03/24, 6:33 pm - +263 71 748 5999: So when do I get the letter
11/03/24, 10:20 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/03/24, 9:00 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Hello
12/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why are you so late for the session?
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Apologies, electricity went again
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/03/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
12/03/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 748 5999: No,but I know the previous steps we've discussed
12/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Babongile, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
12/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Oh okay
12/03/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/03/24, 3:52 pm - +263 71 748 5999: What do you mean "whilst you would be in Zimbabwe itself?"
12/03/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Please even before you come to India, you can start with the EWYL program.
12/03/24, 3:54 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Oh okay
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
12/03/24, 3:56 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Yes,you said fees is scholarship,how come now you're saying I've got to pay?
12/03/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate?
12/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 748 5999: You said I've got to pay first years fees....but you had said the EWYL will cover it
12/03/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Did you read this?
12/03/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: The more you earn through the EWYL program, the less you have to pay.
12/03/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 748 5999: And the financial aid from EDOofa?
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Did you read this, we bring down your fees from $6000-8000 to $2000-3000, and then we give you the opportunity to reduce it further through the EWYL program.
12/03/24, 6:38 pm - +263 71 748 5999: Oh okay
Another question..How many people are in India sir?
12/03/24, 10:06 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
