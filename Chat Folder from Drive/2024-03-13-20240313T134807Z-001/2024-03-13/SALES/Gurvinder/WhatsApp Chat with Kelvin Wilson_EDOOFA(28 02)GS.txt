*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 226 9041: Hie Gurvinder. Thanks for contacting.
28/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 226 9041: Yes we can discuss.
28/02/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Wilson,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 226 9041: Thank you Mr Gurvinder.
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Wilson, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Edith, is that correct?
28/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Hie Mr Gurvinder
I am Kelvin 
Yes, that is correct
28/02/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Edith, also do tell me whether you learnt about Edith’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Okay, sure
She told me that the Edoofa Scholarship Program can offer from 50% to 100% depending on the individuals academic excellence.

She did share her experience with the program and guided me through the procedures of the Application
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more,
28/02/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/02/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/02/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/02/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, you are correct 
It would be a great opportunity, and a big burden would be removed from our shoulders financially
28/02/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kelvin, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, I do believe I, as well as my parents, have what it takes to acquire a higher quantum of scholarship
28/02/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kelvin, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
28/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Okay 
So, as you already know, my name is Kelvin Wilson.

1) My highest education level that I reached was A Level, which I last wrote last year.

8) I attended my high school at Lighthouse Institute, which is located in Chitungwiza, in Mashonaland East Province, and my per-term fees was $100
28/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Kelvin.
28/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study IT, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
28/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I have always been interested in technology from a very young age, and the aspect that technology keeps growing and getting better making life easier only intrigues me to learn more about it.
Despite not having previous experiences where i did not have opportunities to learn much about it, my eagerness to learn about technology did not dispace.
The IT program that I am interested in, is my gateway to get into the ever growing field of technology.
28/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Your passion for technology shines through in your desire to pursue studies in IT. It's clear that your fascination with how technology evolves and improves to simplify life is a driving force behind your decision. Despite any previous limitations, your eagerness to learn and adapt has remained steadfast.
28/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
28/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, my big brother was also interested in the field, but he could not continue with his pursuit due to lack of funds, so he decided to change his interests
28/02/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
28/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Ohky sure, let me do that now
28/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Do you want the documents, or should I just write them down?
28/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 212 1457: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 212 1457: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 212 1457: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 8:37 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Same to you
Take care as well
29/02/24, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

29/02/24, 9:25 am - +263 78 212 1457: Good morning
I am doing okay, thank you. I hope you are well also.
We may continue.
29/02/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: So you didn't give your Business Studies A-level again?
29/02/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 212 1457: No, I didn't 
I could only afford to write one subject and decided to choose Maths
29/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
29/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 212 1457: Okay 
I agree that it is a better degree 
Does it have the same careers as with IT?
29/02/24, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about the course?
29/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, please do
29/02/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course. Apart from pursuing higher study course such as MCA or any related course, students can secure a job in diverse areas such as software development, banks, ITES, government departments, Education, etc.

*What is it About?*

*Job profiles for BCA graduates are:*

	*Programmers*
	*System Analyst*
	*Network Designer*
	*Game Developers and Testers*
	*System Manager*
29/02/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 212 1457: It sounds like a really better choice, especially since it also covers IT skills and more
29/02/24, 11:09 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
29/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, I understood it
Thank you 

It even caters to my interests in technology on how I can use computer appliances to simplify daily living
29/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Given the opportunity. I would aim to secure a job in Cyber Security in the sense that as technology does make life easier and seamless in daily living a problem arises from this, which is vulnerability to hackers.
As different softwares and systems become seamless and can intercommunicate with each other, a hacker might gain access to confidential information using any one of the softwares that are connected together, making it easier for them.
My role would be to ensure that despite the seamless connections in softwares and programs, security is not reduced.
I would manage and make sure that there are no gaps in these system's security and leave no vulnerability for a hacker to infiltrate the system and gain any type of information from it.
I would also try to create a program where as if a hacker tries to infiltrate a system, it will not only block off access but would be able to identify the hacker and notify system managers of a potential threat including being able to track down the source of threat.
29/02/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Kelvin I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I am really willing to give it my all.
I am aware that many problems and challenges will arise, but I will give it my best to acquire my goals
29/02/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I'm my country, the economy is not yet favorable.
Many have finished their degrees in my country but they fail to secure a reasonable job with the degree they studied.
Studying abroad would create career availability
29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, that is correct

With the knowledge I would have acquired, I'd aim to encourage students as well as teachers to partake in the edoofa program as it would be where I got to learn what I learned from
29/02/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Kelvin, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I agree 
To be able to make a change, I have to make a name for myself and be successful enough to be able to accomplish that. <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes 
Please enlighten me on that.
29/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
29/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.

29/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Wow, it is applausible how India is growing and innovations are flooding in 
I understand now how it is the best place for the Edoofa program to be able to fulfill its goals for every student.
29/02/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now Kelvin, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I would like to ask about the cost of living in India during my education
29/02/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/02/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/02/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Okay I understand
29/02/24, 11:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

04/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 212 1457: Yes sir, please do
04/03/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Kelvin, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 212 1457: I see,
So, the whole program is done online
04/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

04/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/03/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 212 1457: The program is very beneficial indeed especially in acquiring the necessary skills that are useful in the pursued field
04/03/24, 11:14 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Kelvin, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/03/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 212 1457: Okay I understand everything 
It _is_ helpful
04/03/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/03/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/03/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, it is an opportunity like no other, and it will definitely help with more than just my education.
04/03/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kelvin, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes sir, that is correct
04/03/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
04/03/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 212 1457: We have discussed about it and since they are present in the group they also have an insight about the whole program 

We are just waiting for the overview of all the exact expenses required after being able to attain the scholarship
04/03/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/03/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, I am
04/03/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Kelvin as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/03/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 212 1457: That would be between $1500 - $2250
04/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Kelvin, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I understand that would be for the application fee only
04/03/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/03/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, that is outstanding for sure
04/03/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
04/03/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
04/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 212 1457: I understand
04/03/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 212 1457: No, not quite
04/03/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kelvin, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/03/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 1:42 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes I understand everything
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Yes, 
Are there certain universities that you are able to work with, or it doesn't matter which university I choose to go to
04/03/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Please, you can choose between any University that sends you an acceptance letter.
04/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 212 1457: Ohky I understand
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
