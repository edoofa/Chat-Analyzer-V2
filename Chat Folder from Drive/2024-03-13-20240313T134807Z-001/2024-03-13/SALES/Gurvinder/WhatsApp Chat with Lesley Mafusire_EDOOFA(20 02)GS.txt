20/02/24, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Lesley, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Ruth, is that correct?
20/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes
20/02/24, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ruth, also do tell me whether you learnt about Ruth’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/02/24, 8:14 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Ruth told me that Edoofa's mission is to provide a scholarly and professional environment to all their students that motivates them to become future leaders
20/02/24, 8:14 pm - +263 78 556 0705: She also told me about the earn while you learn program and the scholarship credits
22/02/24, 8:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
22/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 556 0705: Good morning sir
22/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 556 0705: It’s okay I under
22/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
22/02/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/02/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/02/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/02/24, 11:50 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/02/24, 9:13 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
23/02/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
23/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 556 0705: Good morning
23/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 556 0705: How are you today
23/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 78 556 0705: That is correct
23/02/24, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Lesley, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 556 0705: Good morning
24/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 556 0705: Ohh okay noted

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

29/02/24, 11:10 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

As a computer scientist, I see myself continuously learning and evolving, staying updated  of the latest technologies and advancements.

Professionally, I aim to be working in a challenging and innovative environment, whether it be in a leading tech company, a research institution, or perhaps even starting my own venture. I aspire to be involved in projects that push the boundaries of what is possible, whether it's developing cutting-edge software or exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Moreover, I see myself as a mentor and a leader within the computer science community, sharing my experiences and expertise with others, and inspiring the next generation of technologists. I see myself participating in conferences, workshops, and other events to exchange ideas and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

Overall, in five years, I see myself thriving in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of computer science, making a positive impact through my work and continuing to pursue my passion for technology.
07/03/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lesley I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
07/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes 
You gotta do whatever it takes to make it happen
07/03/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
07/03/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Compared to other countries 
My country is much laid back 
Even if you graduate and get your degree 
It’s not guaranteed to be hired or get a well paying job because of the economy
07/03/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
07/03/24, 8:38 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

I will also work to improve the infrastructure of the educational institutions, so that they are able to provide a better learning environment for the students.

11/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 556 0705: I have a question
11/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 556 0705: I’m now a bit confused

11/03/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please this message was sent due to a technical error.
11/03/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Your results are 68/100 only.
11/03/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Ohhh okay
11/03/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Thank you for letting us know
11/03/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Ohhh
11/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Okay
11/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Thank you for sharing this information with us
11/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
11/03/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes
11/03/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lesley, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/03/24, 4:54 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes
11/03/24, 4:54 pm - +263 78 556 0705: They were not there that day though

11/03/24, 10:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/03/24, 10:21 pm - +263 78 556 0705: It’s okay
11/03/24, 10:21 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Thank you
12/03/24, 9:00 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 9:32 am - +27 60 751 1258: Morning
12/03/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 265 0511: Mrng
12/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 265 0511: We hve a challenge we do not hve zesa since yesterday so Tavonga is not available at the moment so as mie my phone is at 10percent

12/03/24, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 265 0511: Thank you
12/03/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Good afternoon
12/03/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Sorry for being tardy
12/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Had some challenges
12/03/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
12/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes
12/03/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Lesley as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Thousands
12/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 556 0705: At least 1,500
12/03/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Lesley, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/03/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 556 0705: I don’t understand clearly
12/03/24, 2:38 pm - +27 60 751 1258: These statements are conflicting
12/03/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes
12/03/24, 2:38 pm - +27 60 751 1258: There is 750 on top Then the one with covid narration is 350 usd
12/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Cause based on research the cost of applying to any international university is averaged 50-100
So the 750 covers everything else it is just for applying
12/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Please the enrollment fee was $750, but we have reduced that to $350.
12/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/03/24, 2:54 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Now clear
12/03/24, 2:54 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Because at first it was mixed up
12/03/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
12/03/24, 3:03 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Are you asking if we are able to pay 350 usd
12/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/03/24, 3:08 pm - +27 60 751 1258: We are together
12/03/24, 3:08 pm - +27 60 751 1258: We agree
12/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
12/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/03/24, 3:22 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Noted with thanks
12/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
12/03/24, 3:29 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Noo
12/03/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @27607511258, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
12/03/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Understood
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Do we have to do anything in step 2
12/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 556 0705: I think that’s test I already wrote
12/03/24, 4:02 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Ok
12/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 556 0705: I have a question though
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Let’s say we pay for the application fees and end up not getting any responsal from any university
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 556 0705: What happens then
12/03/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 556 0705: And confirm you said the application fee is 350-450?
12/03/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Then your enrollment fee will refunded to you.
12/03/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the enrollment fee is $350.
12/03/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 556 0705: This is paid after all the steps ?
12/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Let me explain.
12/03/24, 4:10 pm - Gurvinder: Step 1: You're currently at Step 1, the counselling session.

Step 2: If you pass Step 1, you'll move on to Step 2, which is eligibility check evaluation.

Step 3: If you pass Step 2, you'll receive an Acceptance Letter, indicating that you've been accepted into our program.

Step 4: Step 4 involves completing enrollment formalities(Paying the enrollment fees).

Step 5: In Step 5, we'll begin the admission process and enroll you in our SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program). This program allows you to earn scholarship credits by completing assignments and projects while you're still in Zimbabwe.

Once we receive responses from our partner universities, you'll be given an Offer Letter detailing your scholarship, fees, and other important information. At the same time, you'll start earning scholarship credits through the SEELS Program to reduce your annual fees.
12/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 556 0705: So the enrollment and application are different
12/03/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Please, no.
12/03/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Ohh okay
12/03/24, 4:13 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Understood
12/03/24, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: There is enrollment fees, which is $350, then there is registration fees, Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-2026.
12/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Are we connected?
12/03/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 556 0705: Yes for sure
12/03/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/03/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
12/03/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
12/03/24, 4:28 pm - +27 60 751 1258: Long walk
12/03/24, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
12/03/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/03/24, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
