*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/03/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 794 0333: Yes  I'm online now
04/03/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 794 0333: We can talk
04/03/24, 11:19 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tanatswa,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 794 0333: Ohk Mr Gurvinder Sir it's an Owner
04/03/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tanatswa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Marc, is that correct?
04/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Ummmm I'm sure it's him Sir ,i dont recall the name
04/03/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Marc, also do tell me whether you learnt about Marc’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 794 0333: No I wasn't told  much except that the Edoofa program is a chance for me to pursue my studies abroad
04/03/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
04/03/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 8:10 am - +263 78 794 0333: Yes Sir it is
05/03/24, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
05/03/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Ohk Sir will
05/03/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tanatswa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Yes Mr Gurvinder Sir I promise I can do it
05/03/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tanatswa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Ohk Sir, so I live in Masvingo Province with my Grandmother .My Parents separated when I was a child so my Father is in SouthAfrica and My mother somewhere here in Zimbabwe so she says  .She  is never  honest of her whereabouts .

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 9:31 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
07/03/24, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.

08/03/24, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Tanatswa I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/03/24, 3:41 am - +263 78 794 0333: I'm willing to do whatever it takes Mr Gurvinder Sir and yes i will put my heart into my studies and make use of all the opportunities I get
09/03/24, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
09/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 794 0333: Yes Sir I'm present
09/03/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/03/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Things are hard here in Zimbabwe Sir , University Prizes keep rising Semester after Semester so I have heard .Plus I have heard that some of world's best Programmers are in India
09/03/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Zimbabwe's education is very good sir ,the only problem is that some of us can't afford to pay for it so if I were to get this scholarship and study abroad I would make sure I help those who can't afford Universities by giving them some money,because the education system is not the problem sir but the Funds is
09/03/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tanatswa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 794 0333: I agree Sir
09/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 794 0333: That's why India is the best for me
09/03/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/03/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 794 0333: No I've never wondered that because I know that India has grown very much in terms of Economic Stability
09/03/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
09/03/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

11/03/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
11/03/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 794 0333: Ummmm no sir please tell me the costs
11/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
11/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

11/03/24, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
