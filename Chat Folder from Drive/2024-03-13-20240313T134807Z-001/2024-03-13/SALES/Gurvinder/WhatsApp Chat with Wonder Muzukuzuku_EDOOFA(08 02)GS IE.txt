10/02/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 515 1330: I came to realize that dreams might only come true if one works very hard, I take Persistence as my role model as for, whatever I want to achieve in life will be possible if only I work hard in my studies
10/02/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 515 1330: Edoofa is so amazing in the sense that it might brings hope to the hopeless with its different types of scholarships
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: That is great, let me brief you about the program.
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 515 1330: Noted
10/02/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Wonder, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 515 1330: It's very true, i want to be an independent individual
10/02/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Now Wonder, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
10/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Of course i am sure it will be in that nature
10/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Myself 

I'm Wonder Muzukuzuku. I have completed my Advanced level studies and got the following grades, History  B and Divinity B. That's my highest education level. 

I would like to pursue my studies in law. That's my dream
Moreover, my parents are deceased but they were farmers, my father succumbed to covid 19 in 2021.But i have got closer relatives (uncles) who support me. 
My parents were educated up to standard 6during the colonial era in southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe

My parents used to back me up in terms of finance, but however after completing my A level the burden crashed

I found a new sponsor, a well wisher in 2021 ,i have chanced a scholarship from hagadol but i never got there because there was covid 19outbreak. The sponsor was willing to pay for the official fees only since the scholarship was covering up air ticket, accommodation and tuition from the Indian government it was alleged. 
Right now I don't have a sponsor to be honest with you. 
I have got 2brothers and 2sisters of which the other brother is younger than me just a school dropout. My elder brother was a police officer but, expelled I don't know the reasons. 

In conclusion i attended Whaddon Chase Primary school and Mvurwi high school respectively from form 1-6.Mvurwi high school is in Mvurwi  town, Mashonaland Central province, Zimbabwe
10/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 515 1330: The school fees at Mvurwi high school was U. S120 per term

Moreover i would like to represent the down played members of the society at an international level, especially the poor  or underprivileged members. Human rights are being abused on a daily basis, thus, this motivates me to become one of the advocates who might voice for the voiceless.

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
12/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 77 515 1330: That's great but what are the qualifications for the above mentioned course
12/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
12/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 515 1330: A most welcome move
12/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

15/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Wonder, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?

15/02/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 515 1330: Yes i wonder why Edoofa opted for students to enroll in Indian universities other than in one of African countries
15/02/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/02/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/02/24, 1:51 am - +263 77 515 1330: Hello sir  

It's my single honor and privilege to make you aware  of my concerns 
as well as grievances towards the scholarship.Firstly ,I'm deeply concerned about the issue of security in India, for the  students .Secondly  I'm worried about accommodation. Issues.In addition what's the cost of an Air ticket recently from Zimbabwe to India. Since, it is a scholarship centered program after completion would one, compensate the scholarship through which means for instance if it is a government scholarship an individual is expected to work for the government for quite a number of years pertaining their terms and conditions of the scholarship.last but not least, basing on my results, what's can you advise me on the programs which might also seem fit for me to undertake besides the study of law for instance may I be able to take on human resources management as well?
17/02/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
17/02/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 515 1330: Good morning
17/02/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Please, the course offered to you is the best one for your subject combination.
17/02/24, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: You don't have to do anything for the program after completion of your higher education.
17/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: About the security issue, I would like to assure you that our Department of Student Welfare regularly visits the Universities for the welfare of students.
17/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
17/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 515 1330: On behalf of my family, edoofa is not comparable to any other other international scholarship it's services are outstanding for an international student so to speak any student without a scholarship to Indian universities is more costly than those with scholarships
19/02/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
19/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 515 1330: Morning
19/02/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
19/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 515 1330: ☝️
19/02/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/02/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/02/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/02/24, 11:11 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
20/02/24, 7:48 am - +263 77 515 1330: Understood
20/02/24, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

23/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Ok
23/02/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Wonder, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 77 515 1330: It's OK sir, it is a very good programme indeed, and I appreciate the fact that it is the backbone of Edoofa. 21st century requires prossessional people could implement their skills in our everyday lives at the Same time raising tuition fees
23/02/24, 4:44 pm - +263 77 515 1330: May I ask, is it a privilege or given upon merit, the Earn While you learn scholarship
28/02/24, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,

04/03/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/03/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/03/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

04/03/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 8:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
05/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Good afternoon
05/03/24, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
05/03/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 515 1330: I have seen these good examples
05/03/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Of course  it's examplary, but as an individual those webinars might be helpful to me to a greater extent in the sense that by the time i would finish my program i would have attained a lot of experience in different fields
05/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this first.
05/03/24, 7:54 pm - +263 77 515 1330: I'm very sorry i haven't been able to access internet connection, as I have spoken before I'm in Murehwa rural, Mashonaland east the network is down over there
05/03/24, 7:55 pm - +263 77 515 1330: I'm really sorry for the inconvenience s  caused
06/03/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Hello
06/03/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
06/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 515 1330: I can safely admit that given such an opportunity and exposure of interacting with the rest of the world, showcasing what I could have learnt at university is a great privilege to me. In short it's indeed helpful to me displaying my a talent and ability by means of those Webinars is a most welcome and greatly appreciated move to me. Truly that is how Edoofians are different  and unique to other university and college graduates
06/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Wonder, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Noted
06/03/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/03/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Yes
06/03/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Wonder, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/03/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 515 1330: this is really what I have been anticipating, Earn while you learn  is a very good programme
06/03/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Yes that's the way it should be
06/03/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Yes i have discussed with them about international education already
06/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 515 1330: Yes I'm ever ready
06/03/24, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Wonder as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 515 1330: One would spend more money that's multiply by 5(300-450)
06/03/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please answer the figures.

07/03/24, 8:37 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
