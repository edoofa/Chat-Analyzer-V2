What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Nkosilomusa provided valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship Program, emphasizing the application process and the unique Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, along with the financial aspects. 

In terms of the application process, Nkosilomusa highlighted the competitive nature of the program due to its widespread popularity. To expedite the process, he offered to assist in prioritizing the evaluation of submitted forms and securing an early career counseling session with an academic expert.

Choosing Edoofa over other agents and consultants, Nkosilomusa stressed authenticity and affordability. Unlike other options, Edoofa stood out by providing continuous support beyond admission, including assistance with accommodation, registration, and documentation. Nkosilomusa's personal experience at the airport, greeted by the mentor/Edoofa team, showcased the program's commitment to student welfare.

The core of the Edoofa Program lies in its Earn While You Learn (EWYL) initiative. Nkosilomusa explained that Edoofians participate in real-time projects from industry leaders, access internship opportunities, and attend live webinars with African CEOs. The unique aspect of this program is the ability to self-finance education beyond the initial scholarship by earning credits through project work.

Nkosilomusa shared his financial journey, highlighting a 50% tuition fee reduction based on merit, extracurriculars, statement of purpose, and recommendations from senior Edoofians. He stated that the fees will range from $1500 to $3000 per annum after the scholarship. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work on projects, earning scholarship credits each month. Some seniors managed to cover their entire $2000 cost through this initiative, serving as inspiration for others.

The involvement of parents in the process was underscored, with regular updates on the student's progress. Nkosilomusa emphasized the program's unique feature of keeping parents informed at every step. Beyond financial benefits, the EWYL program provides a platform to improve skills, expand networks, and collaborate with potential future employers.

In conclusion, Nkosilomusa's messages provide a comprehensive understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, shedding light on the application process, financial aspects, and the transformative impact of the Earn While You Learn program.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Qualifying for a scholarship involves a combination of academic merit, extracurricular achievements, personal statements, and letters of recommendation. Demonstrating passion, commitment, and alignment with the scholarship's values enhances one's eligibility, making them a strong candidate for financial assistance. I believe I'm one of those students.

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
15/02/24, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Nkosilomusa, can you please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
16/02/24, 8:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like you to excuse me for not participating in the session yesterday, I had a family emergency,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
16/02/24, 11:25 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/02/24, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
17/02/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 356 0101: Hello counsellor ,thank you , my network is often erratic , can we continue
17/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
17/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 356 0101: Sorry I never got the questions
17/02/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Takudzwa Chikoko_EDOOFA(15/02)GS IE" to "Takudzwa Chikoko_EDOOFA(15/02)GS"
17/02/24, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nkosilomusa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nkosilomusa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
17/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 356 0101: In short I learnt that Edoofa program has assisted a big number of students from Africa and Zimbabwe to pursue tertiary education at reputable Indian universities via funded scholarship packages , Nkosilomusa says the trip to India and the education process are all very commendable and the life is affordable for students enrolled ,as such I wish Takudzwa could get the scholarship as well
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17/02/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
17/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 356 0101: Thank you , it's a rich history , bright future and  proven track record , I hope my son will be able to secure a scholarship with Edoofa
17/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chikoko, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
17/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 356 0101: Yes indeed , I think I do have the requisites in question despite my network challenges
17/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mr Chikoko, I would like to know Takudzwa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

03/03/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 475 3006: Okay let me read
03/03/24, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/03/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 475 3006: I'm done. Where do students do their attachment?
03/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Which means an Aerospace engineer can fly a plane?
03/03/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Please, they design airplanes, not fly them.
03/03/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 356 0101: Thank you counsellor , so when are we going to know the percentage scholarship offered to this boy by Edoofa
03/03/24, 12:41 pm - +263 77 356 0101: I think just as some mechanics can drive cars ,so can aero engineers ,but it's not their job 😂😂😂
03/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be done after the interview with the program director.
03/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
03/03/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Yes, I understood
03/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
03/03/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 475 3006: No, I wasn't meaning that their job is to fly airplanes. I was just asking if they can do it.
03/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 475 3006: What scholarship percentage is that?
03/03/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please this is based on the 50% scholarship criteria, after the interview the final scholarship percentage will be decided upon.
03/03/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay, I hope it will reduce further because my parents won't afford the fees mentioned above
03/03/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted Earn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
03/03/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay
03/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Takudzwa, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/03/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Noted
03/03/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 475 3006: What is the maximum scholarship percentage one can get
04/03/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
04/03/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 475 3006: I'm online 🙋‍♂
04/03/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: Please one can get a 50%-100% scholarship.
04/03/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay Okay
04/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Let's continue with the session. I'm online
04/03/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Yes, I'm ready
04/03/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities
04/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay
04/03/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
04/03/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
04/03/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: However Takudzwa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay, so what scholarship percentage did I get?
04/03/24, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be decided after the interview round.
04/03/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Is the fee paid after getting an offer letter from the university?
04/03/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay, thank you
04/03/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please the enrollment fee is paid after you are accepted by the program.
04/03/24, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 475 3006: I once was familiar with it, van you send me the cycle again?
04/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay so when will I get accepted?
04/03/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Takudzwa, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/03/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 2:13 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Yes I understood
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 475 3006: Okay
04/03/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 475 3006: No, I understood
04/03/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
04/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
