04/03/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tinashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kundai, is that correct?
04/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 674 5048: No l actually got to know about it via Facebook then l started researching till l had a chat with Ananya mam
04/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ms Ananya?
04/03/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Am I allowed to make an audio
04/03/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Please respond via text.
04/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok l will
04/03/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Basically Ananya mam taught me all l know  about Edoofa inclusive of it helps vulnerable students who are unable to pay fully for their school fees . Secondly Edoofa assists students interms of helping them boost their confidence through high quality professional mentorship . Thirdly  it helps students attain their education in a clean affordable way . I also got to learn about the term earn while you learn . Last but not least I also got to learn that  enrolled students get to meet some of the multinational recognized CEOz across the globe . 


Seriously l am much impressed and intrigued about this program .

I hope l will be part of the Edoofian family .Thank you
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes yes l am looking forward in granted this opportunity
04/03/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinashe, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/03/24, 3:35 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes I do
04/03/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tinashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

04/03/24, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: So can you please tell me, are you planning to do a diploma?
04/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Thank you

04/03/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: So as I can see that you filled the application form for the counselling session but in that you wrote that you want to do engineering but right now you are telling that you want to study business, so can you please share what changed your mind?
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 674 5048: What changed my mind is that when I wrote the test l wrote under department of commerce because I discovered that  a person who did commercials should write what he did in high school . I also discovered that I have enterprenueral skills unlike Engineering department which I think isn't for me .

Sorry for causing the commotion

04/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok basically what motivates me is this feeling that l feel most of the times . The feeling to make change world wide . As you can see most Africans especially my fellow Zimbabweans are un employed . So when I think about unemployment as well as starvation  lingering around it gives me the strength because I hate to see widows , orphans , elderly people sleep on empty stomach seriously it hurts n pains me
04/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Am sorry for saying more than required . I apologize
04/03/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Your desire to make a positive impact and alleviate suffering on a global scale is truly inspiring. I admire your compassion for those who are struggling, and your determination to create change is commendable.
04/03/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
04/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 674 5048: No no one has ever even  thought of that . They support the idea of food to mouth only
04/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level results for evaluation?

05/03/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tinashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 674 5048: Sir as far as my education is concerned l will even give 300%  hardwork as well as concerntration .

05/03/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/03/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 674 5048: The main reason l don't want to study in my country is because 1st my parents can't afford for my tertiary tuition in the first place 2ndly the education abroad is advanced as well as technical 3rdly l can get to meet some CEOz outside  this country . Right now l am unable to meet any CEOz or business tycoons bcz of my poor financial status 4thly Mentorship here in Zimbabwe   is technically not for free to everyone especially to those with poor financial status 5thly When l study abroad l can to learn new cultures the way they live  and meet new people . 

Thank you
05/03/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 71 674 5048: Ok basically if  given the opportunity  l am going to introduce what l have already learnt from you the idea of earn while you learn. And also the introduction of assisting students  with practical and technical programs  especially opharns and the vulnerable ones like the disabled etc  . Free practical education to the disabled especially
05/03/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 71 674 5048: I do agree
05/03/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: True  true  l heard so
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So can you please post my results

05/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Please explain
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: I explained you here.

05/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes I did understand the course . I had a better understanding
05/03/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So what is the way forward after showing me these results .
05/03/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
05/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Hello l am
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes l am highly motivated
05/03/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 674 5048: What if l start by studying for the first 3 years or so then l pay my fees once I start working
06/03/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Hi am online
06/03/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please that is not possible.
06/03/24, 1:14 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ooh ok so I have to pay first am l correct
06/03/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
06/03/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So since you said l am now an Edoofian so when is the enrollment process taking place
06/03/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 674 5048: And also when are the ones who got the scholarship going abroad
06/03/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tinashe, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 674 5048: I believe my father will be doing so .
06/03/24, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes l am ready
06/03/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 674 5048: To be truly honest I don't think my father will be able to raise this kind of money . Isn't there any other way coz his monthly income isn't even near to the quarter of $ 2000-3000. Isn't there any other way please assist me with ideas n solutions because the situation at home isn't favourable <This message was edited>
06/03/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 674 5048: I am indeed overwhelmed by this scholarship program but I don't even have a clue how l would raise that kind of money . Please don't get offended l am just explaining the situation at home as of the enrollment fees l know my father can raise it
06/03/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please the cost of education is $2000-3000 per year, and then comes the EWYL program,  if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So are you saying there is also a room for those who wish to pay for their school fees monthly
06/03/24, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I will explain that to you ahead
06/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Woww go deeper please am more curious to learn
06/03/24, 1:33 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok okay sorry for interrupting
06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/03/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/03/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 674 5048: This is the exact information that l was seeking . Please do go deeper
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So you mean all those guys earned their certificates wow to be honest that is excellent . This is the exact motivation l was seeking
06/03/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
06/03/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 674 5048: I am more than motivated sir
06/03/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes l am ready
06/03/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
06/03/24, 1:46 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok okay
06/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So once l pay my enrollment fee l will be a fully an Edoofian
06/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Go to the roots
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/03/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
06/03/24, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: However Tinashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
06/03/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok so basically where is the acceptance letter . Where can l get it
06/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So my parents have to pay $200 in 7 days then the other $100 after 30 days as an admission fee am I correct
06/03/24, 1:59 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So when is the process of paper work and money affairs expected to be finished so that l can have a deadline so as for my parents to raise money
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be done after this counselling session.
06/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ooh okay go ahead sorry for interrupting once again
06/03/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Are  not yet  can you please summarize it for me
06/03/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/03/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tinashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
06/03/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/03/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Haaaa thank you so much . Now l have a better understanding . Thank you so much . Let's proceed
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/03/24, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Aaah no as of now l don't have any questions since you showed me the  Edoofian Cycle .
06/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 674 5048: We can proceed though
06/03/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/03/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/03/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/03/24, 9:03 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 674 5048: Hi am online
12/03/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: So are your parents active?
12/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 674 5048: Yes they are
12/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: @263776986054 So I hope you have managed to go through Tinashe's acceptance letter?
12/03/24, 9:55 am - +263 77 698 6054: Yes sir
12/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
12/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 674 5048: I just wanna confirm , the only costs that l am going to endure here in Zimbabwe are enrollment costs only amounting to $350
12/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 674 5048: Can the enrollment fee be paid in hard cash and where are the offices such that those transactions can be made
12/03/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct?
12/03/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: May I know, did you went through the payment methods?
12/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 674 5048: I noticed that on acceptance letter there was an account nr receiving the payments . So I was just asking if it's the only option
12/03/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 674 5048: Ok thank you
12/03/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 674 5048: So sir about admission fee . So is that payment process  going to take place in August and the amount is specifically $500 . Correct me if l am wrong
12/03/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Please the registration fees can be variable, and the deadline mentioned for that will be specified by the University itself.
12/03/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 674 5048: Ok
12/03/24, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
12/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 698 6054: Ok,2
12/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account.
12/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, *Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's* account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, *His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.*
12/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
