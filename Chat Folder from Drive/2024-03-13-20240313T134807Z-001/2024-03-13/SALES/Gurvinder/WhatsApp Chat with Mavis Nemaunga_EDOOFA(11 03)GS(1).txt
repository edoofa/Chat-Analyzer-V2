You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

11/03/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mavis, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, is that correct?
11/03/24, 2:20 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Yes that correct
11/03/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, also do tell me whether you learnt about Blessing’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
11/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 103 0033: I learnt a lot about the Edoofa Program,, l learnt that studying abroad  reduce fee hikes rather than studing in Zimbabwe,. It is  also cheap to study in India because the tution fees of our country is very expensive. When studying in inda you will be aware of the expenses and you can support your family through part time employment during my course, l also learnt that you can also learn about that we must value our educational infrastructure much that they can access a necessity like internet for around $40 for the whole year, After graduation in  Zimbabwe many seniors are struggling with unemployment but abroad apportunities are easy
11/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Just to mention a few among athers
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program clearly.
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
11/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
11/03/24, 4:00 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Thank you, l learnt
11/03/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
11/03/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Yes thats true Mr Gurvinder
11/03/24, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mavis, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Mr Gurvinder is the counselling done online or physically?
11/03/24, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Please it is done online.
11/03/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Okay,, yes my parents will be available and I will be proactive in thr counseling session
11/03/24, 9:01 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Hello
12/03/24, 9:02 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 103 0033: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
12/03/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Now Mavis, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

12/03/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Your passion for making a difference in the lives of people, particularly the vulnerable, is truly commendable and aligns closely with the objectives of social work. However, pursuing a law degree alongside or instead of social work can offer unique advantages and opportunities to achieve these goals:

Advocacy and Legal Support: As a lawyer, you'll have the ability to advocate for individuals and communities in legal settings, ensuring that their rights are protected and that they have access to justice. Your legal training will enable you to navigate complex legal systems, challenge discrimination, and seek redress for injustices, complementing the direct support and assistance provided through social work.

Policy and Systemic Change: Lawyers play a crucial role in shaping social policies and laws that impact vulnerable populations. With a background in law, you can influence policy decisions, advocate for systemic reforms, and address the root causes of social issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This systemic approach can complement the individual-focused interventions of social work and lead to broader, long-term impact.

Combating Injustice and Inequality: Law offers a powerful tool for addressing systemic injustices and inequalities in society. By pursuing a career in law, you can work to change discriminatory laws and practices, challenge systemic barriers to social justice, and promote equality under the law for all individuals, including the most vulnerable members of society.

Diverse Career Opportunities: A law degree opens up diverse career opportunities beyond traditional legal practice. You can work in areas such as public interest law, human rights advocacy, policy analysis, legislative drafting, and international development, allowing you to make a difference in various fields and contexts.

Interdisciplinary Approach: Law is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with various disciplines, including sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary perspective enhances your understanding of social issues and equips you with a holistic approach to addressing complex social problems, complementing the skills and knowledge gained through social work training.

Overall, while social work is a noble and valuable profession, pursuing a law degree can offer additional avenues for making a difference, advocating for social justice, and effecting meaningful change at both the individual and systemic levels. By combining the insights and skills of both disciplines, you can enhance your ability to create positive impact and contribute to building a more just and equitable society.

12/03/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mavis, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
12/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 103 0033: Yes, l wonder why
12/03/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
