*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/03/24, 3:59 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Hie
04/03/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Jeti,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Alrighty Mr Gurvinder. Thank you
04/03/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Jeti, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from TADIWANASHE, is that correct?
04/03/24, 4:07 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Correct
04/03/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 4:13 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Honestly speaking I haven't learned much about Edoofa program. I am staying in south Africa and my daughter Lissa is the one who communicated with Tadiwanashe and I guess she was interested that's when sho told me about this
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 4:27 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Thank you very much for your briefing.
05/03/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
06/03/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
06/03/24, 9:36 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
07/03/24, 7:47 am - +27 65 386 2593: Good morning
07/03/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
I would like to inform you that, you have been inactive throughout the counselling session, I would like you to complete your counselling session today or I would have to close your application.
07/03/24, 10:00 am - +27 65 386 2593: Ok let's carry on
07/03/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
07/03/24, 11:07 am - +27 65 386 2593: Pressure at work
07/03/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Please I cannot move ahead if you are not active.
07/03/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/03/24, 3:03 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes
07/03/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why did you went inactive again?
07/03/24, 3:30 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I'm responding as soon as I get your messages. If you are not getting them right away it's network problems
07/03/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Jeti, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/03/24, 3:35 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes I do
07/03/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Jeti, I would like to know Lissa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does she studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was her per-term fee in A level?



Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
09/03/24, 10:49 am - +27 65 386 2593: Alrighty. Do you mind briefing Bachelor of Legislative law
09/03/24, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/03/24, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/03/24, 11:11 am - +27 65 386 2593: Alrighty thank you. I really appreciate the government's considerations
09/03/24, 11:15 am - +27 65 386 2593: That's true I will make sure and advise Lissa to work hard so that she will come with high points
09/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 666 4636: This message was deleted
09/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 666 4636: Hey... Im really looking forward to come up with high points
09/03/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
09/03/24, 11:57 am - +27 65 386 2593: Yes please

09/03/24, 1:15 pm - +27 65 386 2593: All understood thank you
09/03/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/03/24, 2:55 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I will see myself taking responsibilities in all measures.After 5 years I feel like everyone in the community will be honouring me in regard with my career.  This course will help me being more practical. It will also help me to deal with different kinds of people with different issues. Edoofa's programme will help me to be more focused and should be hardworking. Being in the program and studying with other students will also help me focus on my dreams because we will be students from different countries. So socializing with other people will also help in my career.
09/03/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Lissa I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/03/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 666 4636: Yes you can
09/03/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/03/24, 3:04 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I really appreciate your comments. Yes I promise to work  very hard to dedicate to my career.
09/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 666 4636: Yes l am willing to give my 200% hard work sir
09/03/24, 3:06 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Honestly studying abroad might help me to be more focus and obviously abroad most resources will be available unlike in my country. Abroad can also help me meet new people with different characters
09/03/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/03/24, 3:25 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes I am 💯 willing to have maximum exposure in life. I think  I will try maybe to have online group activities inspiring other students to work hard. Will also contribute to advise others to work hard in practical subjects hence they can learn to do some staff on their own
09/03/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Lissa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/03/24, 3:35 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I agree sir. Thank you
11/03/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
11/03/24, 3:05 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Good afternoon
11/03/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/03/24, 3:13 pm - +27 65 386 2593: That's true
11/03/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
11/03/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

12/03/24, 9:12 am - +27 65 386 2593: Let's continue
12/03/24, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: So now Lissa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
12/03/24, 9:54 am - +27 65 386 2593: I have understood everything so far. Thank you. My question is I get a seat for my schoorship do you  offer free accommodation
12/03/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: I will explain that to you ahead, please.
12/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/03/24, 10:06 am - +27 65 386 2593: Ok noted
12/03/24, 10:07 am - +27 65 386 2593: Not yet
12/03/24, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
12/03/24, 10:08 am - +27 65 386 2593: Brief us please. We have no idea
12/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/03/24, 10:31 am - +27 65 386 2593: This is great. Thank you
12/03/24, 10:32 am - +27 65 386 2593: Very affordable we Edoofa for this. Looking forward to be one of the selected students
12/03/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
12/03/24, 10:56 am - +27 65 386 2593: Yes will appreciate that
12/03/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Lissa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/03/24, 12:23 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Noted thank you
12/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

12/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

12/03/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
12/03/24, 1:27 pm - +27 65 386 2593: I think this will benefit me
12/03/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Lissa, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/03/24, 1:51 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Whaal nice to hear about this
12/03/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/03/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/03/24, 2:41 pm - +27 65 386 2593: That's exactly what I am looking for. Thank you
12/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Lissa, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
12/03/24, 3:05 pm - +27 65 386 2593: That's correct
12/03/24, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
12/03/24, 5:34 pm - +27 65 386 2593: Yes I did.
