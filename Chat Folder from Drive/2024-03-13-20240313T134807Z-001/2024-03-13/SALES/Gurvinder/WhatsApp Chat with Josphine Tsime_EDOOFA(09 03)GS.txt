09/03/24, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Josphine, Mr and Mrs Tsime!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
09/03/24, 9:09 am - +263 77 451 2549: Yes you have contacted the right people
09/03/24, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Josphine,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 77 451 2549: Okay and you it's also a great pleasure to connect with you
09/03/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Josphine, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Hazel, is that correct?
09/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 451 2549: Yes she is the one who told me about Edoofa
09/03/24, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Hazel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Hazel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/03/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 451 2549: Okay I learnt that the Edoofa Program is a scholarship program which help students to learn at an affordable tuition fee that means parents have to pay less fees
09/03/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 451 2549: Yes I learnt about her journey she told me everything about it
09/03/24, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
09/03/24, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/03/24, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/03/24, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/03/24, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 451 2549: Yes that is exactly what I want
09/03/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Josphine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/03/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 451 2549: Yes I think so
09/03/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now Josphine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
09/03/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 451 2549: My name is Josphine Tsime and I'm aged 17.
I was born on the 15th of December 2006.
I'm the fist born in a family of 3 girls.
All my siblings are still schooling with one doing Form 2 and the other one is doing Grade one.
I had 10 subjects at O'level with 5 As and 5 Bs . 
My father is a teacher with a Honours Degree in Mathematics and my mom is not employed and she is studied up to Form 4.
I'm an Upper 6 student at Grasslands High School which is in Marondera ,Mashonaland East Province .
Our term fee for A level's is hundred and sixty dollars .
I am currently doing Mathematics , Biology , Chemistry and Geography at A level . 
I am very much interested in medical sciences and would like to study medicine as my course at tertiary level.
I have been supported for education  by my parents and they are the ones to also support me for higher education abroad.
09/03/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Josphine.
09/03/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
09/03/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Same here
09/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 451 2549: I'm very much interested in saving people's life and that has made medicine the best course for me since I was in primary school.
 I have also admired the white lab coat worn by doctors
09/03/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
09/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Sorry I didn't understand should I send the photos or I just tell you
09/03/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Please send photos.
09/03/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Oky
09/03/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 451 2549: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 451 2549: <Media omitted>
09/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Josphine, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/03/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry
09/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Okay I see
09/03/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with any of the given courses.
09/03/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Eish I don't know yet because I like to do medicine so I will see
09/03/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Please let me know till tomorrow then.
09/03/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Okay I will let you know
09/03/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 451 2549: This message was deleted
10/03/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 451 2549: I would like to do Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology
10/03/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 347 1142: I think Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy can be good for you.
11/03/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
11/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 347 1142: mrng sir
11/03/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 347 1142: i am sorry for the mean time she is in the lesson.
11/03/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, when will she be available?
11/03/24, 12:57 pm - +263 77 347 1142: she will break at 1600hrs and the study will resume at 1800hrs and break at 2100hrs
11/03/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
11/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 77 451 2549: I'm now online sir how are you
11/03/24, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, which course you want to go ahead with?
11/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Okay I will do Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy
11/03/24, 4:44 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
11/03/24, 4:44 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Yes i m confident about it
11/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 451 2549: What about cardiovascular technology what are your minimum points
11/03/24, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please the eligibility criteria is the same for every course.
11/03/24, 4:49 pm - +263 77 451 2549: Okay sir thank you
11/03/24, 10:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
12/03/24, 9:23 am - +263 77 347 1142: morning sir
12/03/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 347 1142: I am sorry Josphine is on lessons now.can you start at 1300hrs
12/03/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Please, are you available for the session?
12/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 347 1142: She is still at school
12/03/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: I am talking about you, are you available for the session?
12/03/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 347 1142: Ok.yes sir
12/03/24, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
12/03/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 347 1142: yes sir
12/03/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
12/03/24, 1:17 pm - +263 77 347 1142: That's nice
12/03/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
12/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Yes I did
12/03/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 347 1142: it's really good
12/03/24, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please tell me why you want your daughter to study abroad and not in your country?
12/03/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 347 1142: There are actually better opportunities for those students who did their programs out there as compared to those in Zimbabwe.Again that issue sponsorship is crucial as it will assist us as parents with a poor financial background.Most of the universities here in Zimbabwe are actually incapacitated interms of resources so the students really lack the practical aspect in their training and this will affect students in their career development.
12/03/24, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming for her to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning her to study abroad.
12/03/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 347 1142: very true
12/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
12/03/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 347 1142: I just understand India as the best country offering medical courses world wide and not much about it's history
12/03/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
12/03/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.

12/03/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 347 1142: It's really a country of great trust education wise
12/03/24, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: So now @263773471142, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
12/03/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Ok.thank you sir.just really need to confirm how you consider these students for a full or partial scholarship?
12/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you that in order to be found eligible for the Edoofa scholarship program you need to clear the eligibility procedures 
The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-
-Interview call with the Program Mentor
-Scholarship Test(Online/Offline)
-Final interview with Program Manager(via WhatsApp voice notes from a different interview group)

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, etc would be evaluated!
12/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Ok.thank for clarification
12/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 347 1142: thank you for clarification
12/03/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
12/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 77 347 1142: No sir
12/03/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/03/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/03/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/03/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/03/24, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/03/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Ok
12/03/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
12/03/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Yes sir
12/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: @263773471142, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs

12/03/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
12/03/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Yes.this will benefit much
12/03/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263773471142, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/03/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Ok.
12/03/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/03/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/03/24, 5:31 pm - +263 77 347 1142: Really.thank you so much sir
