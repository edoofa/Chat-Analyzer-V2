*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
09/03/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 223 7113: Good morning, you are welcome
09/03/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Kamhungira,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/03/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 223 7113: Ok Mr Gurvinder go ahead
09/03/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Kamhungira, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Emilia, is that correct?
09/03/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 223 7113: Sure sure
09/03/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Emilia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Emilia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/03/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 223 7113: I did learn that Ediofa Program offers scholarships for students                 I didn not learn anything about Emilias Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program
09/03/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
09/03/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/03/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/03/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/03/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/03/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 223 7113: That is true
09/03/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Kamhungira, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/03/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 223 7113: Yes I think I have what it takes to meet these significant metrics
09/03/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Kamhungira, I would like to know Chido better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?

11/03/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Your passion for making a difference in the lives of people, particularly the vulnerable, is truly commendable and aligns closely with the objectives of social work. However, pursuing a law degree alongside or instead of social work can offer unique advantages and opportunities to achieve these goals:

Advocacy and Legal Support: As a lawyer, you'll have the ability to advocate for individuals and communities in legal settings, ensuring that their rights are protected and that they have access to justice. Your legal training will enable you to navigate complex legal systems, challenge discrimination, and seek redress for injustices, complementing the direct support and assistance provided through social work.

Policy and Systemic Change: Lawyers play a crucial role in shaping social policies and laws that impact vulnerable populations. With a background in law, you can influence policy decisions, advocate for systemic reforms, and address the root causes of social issues such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This systemic approach can complement the individual-focused interventions of social work and lead to broader, long-term impact.

Combating Injustice and Inequality: Law offers a powerful tool for addressing systemic injustices and inequalities in society. By pursuing a career in law, you can work to change discriminatory laws and practices, challenge systemic barriers to social justice, and promote equality under the law for all individuals, including the most vulnerable members of society.

Diverse Career Opportunities: A law degree opens up diverse career opportunities beyond traditional legal practice. You can work in areas such as public interest law, human rights advocacy, policy analysis, legislative drafting, and international development, allowing you to make a difference in various fields and contexts.

Interdisciplinary Approach: Law is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with various disciplines, including sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary perspective enhances your understanding of social issues and equips you with a holistic approach to addressing complex social problems, complementing the skills and knowledge gained through social work training.

Overall, while social work is a noble and valuable profession, pursuing a law degree can offer additional avenues for making a difference, advocating for social justice, and effecting meaningful change at both the individual and systemic levels. By combining the insights and skills of both disciplines, you can enhance your ability to create positive impact and contribute to building a more just and equitable society.
