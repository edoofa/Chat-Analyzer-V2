11/1/24, 6:17 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Good morning Mr Rithvik did my daughter arrive at Dehli Airport, she's currently out of contact. I last talked to her whilst she was in Dubai
11/1/24, 6:18 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Ms Ashi good morning, any information abt Rufaro 's arrival
11/1/24, 7:16 AM - +263 71 133 8660: I'm at the airport right now
11/1/24, 7:16 AM - +263 71 133 8660: Waiting at the ATM
11/1/24, 7:26 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Greetings Rufaro
I hope you are doing well!
11/1/24, 7:34 AM - +263 71 133 8660: I'm not doing okay
11/1/24, 7:34 AM - +263 71 133 8660: No one is hear pick me up and you said someone would do that
11/1/24, 7:36 AM - +263 71 133 8660: You can't just expect me to board a bus by my own. I don't even know the currency and know anything. There is a lot of people and everyone is trying to help and l don't know who is who
11/1/24, 7:36 AM - +263 71 133 8660: I can't board a bus on my own
11/1/24, 7:37 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Rufaro, I hope you have got the travel instructions from Mr Akshit?
11/1/24, 7:37 AM - +263 71 133 8660: Ms Ashi you said someone would be hear to pick me up
11/1/24, 7:39 AM - +263 71 133 8660: I don't know him and I haven't got anything
11/1/24, 7:39 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Rufaro, please pick my call, I will assist you with everything. The Indo bus booth is right in front of you near the KFC.
11/1/24, 7:49 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Rufaro, you will have to ask the lady at the counter to give you a ticket to Lovely Professional University.
11/1/24, 8:19 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Also, Rufaro, I just had a discussion with Ms. Ashi and Mr. Rithvik to understand the instructions that were shared with you. As per the instructions, you were advised to call Mr. Rithvik, the head of student welfare, upon your arrival. This step ensures that you receive guidance to board the bus to India without any hassle.
11/1/24, 8:20 AM - Sagar Edoofa: I am sure you too understand that, unlike a typical scenario where students travel in a batch, you planned to travel alone by taking a term off and the arrival assistance at the airport is extended to students traveling on the designated dates communicated by the Edoofa Team and University Officials. 

Unfortunately, due to the considerable distance of 8 hours between the IGI International Airport Delhi and the university, replicating the same arrangements for students traveling on different dates becomes impractical.
11/1/24, 8:20 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Also, as I mentioned during our call, we are here to ensure your smooth arrival. To avoid any such challenges, we diligently share arrival instructions well in advance, a process that was completed earlier in your case.

This is precisely why you were advised to contact Mr. Rithvik upon landing. Subsequently, I as the dedicated team member at DSW will maintain continuous contact with you throughout your journey to the university.
11/1/24, 8:20 AM - Sagar Edoofa: Once you deboard your bus, we will be at the university to receive and assist you, ensuring you are able to settle down without any hassles. Your well-being and comfort during this transition in your life are our utmost priorities and you can rest assured that we are here for you.
11/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 240 6132: But it's not easy for the child please, but why, how possible her   with all the luggage, this isn't professional at all. You told the child and us that you will pick her up.
Imagine the trauma she's going through 😭😭😭
11/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Everything new, luggage, buses, all the luggage. If she could have not earlier it was much better. Why
11/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Is this what we can call a safe journey.
Entrusting a child in your hands takes a lot of courage for a parent. I know my child, you're yet to know her capacity.
Upon that she stummers
11/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 240 6132: So what was the purpose for all this

11/1/24, 10:21 AM - +263 78 240 6132: The message finds me unwell.

OK Rufaro made a mistake which anyone can make, but isn't it was wise to inform the student and us earlier to be psychological ready than surprising a student, how would you explain such a surprise after being assured we will be waiting at airport, making her send pictures of her for identification.

May a say am not happy
11/1/24, 10:23 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Communication should have been done not traumatized the student and parents.
Not all people are able to adjust and act accordingly with such surprises.
Trust is vital though
11/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sagar Edoofa: I understand your concerns, @263782406132 .

I want to assure you that we are currently in touch with Rufaro since she landed. Our standard procedure includes requesting pictures from every student. Rest assured, we are connected with Rufaro, and I have personally spoken with the bus conductor and officials at the airport to ensure her well-being. Additionally, Mr. Arshdeep will be at the University to receive Rufaro and provide the necessary assistance upon her arrival.
11/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 240 6132: Ok thank you.
11/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 240 6132: I hope my child is safe and she's in your hands.
13/1/24, 7:49 AM - +263 71 133 8660: When am I starting school

I can see that you have not responded to the Wednesday Wisdom. Kindly go through the Wednesday Wisdom and share your learnings with me and then go through the message below :

We value your feedback and understand the challenges you face regarding our DSW Sessions. Many of you have expressed concerns about not being able to attend DSW sessions due to prior commitments and the lack of fixed schedules.

To address this issue, we're introducing a new system to streamline session attendance. We have created a form where you can *_select a dedicated day and time slot_* for your sessions with me. This will ensure that you have a set time to attend, making it easier to plan around your other commitments.

While you fill out the form, please include this passcode: *E639*. Please take a moment to fill out the form provided before *9 PM IST* today. Your input is crucial in helping us implement this new system effectively.

These new timings will come into effect starting *9th March*, providing you with more predictability and convenience in attending sessions.
