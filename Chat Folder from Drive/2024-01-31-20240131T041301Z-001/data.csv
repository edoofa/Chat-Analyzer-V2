120 - 30 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about, 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled 2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
121 - 30 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.  Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.  Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.  I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.  While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached  Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

Q2.""Hello,I am Memory Chimchenga,a former student from your school.I am so happy to connect with you again.I thank you for your support during my time at school.I am so excited to share good news with you. I applied for a scholarship program and i am now part of an amazing society,The EdOOFA,education for all.The indian program provides 50%-100% scholarship on tuition fees making higher quality education more affordable for multiple students all over the world.The program does not only ensure affordability but also ensures employability so that the Eddofians become reliable people in their communities.you know whats also exciting!students are also given online projects through the earn while you learn(EWYL) program,therefore earning employability skills and scholarship credits simultaneously.This program will help me attain high quality education and necessary skills which are needed for me to achieve my future aspirations of becoming a specialist in hematology.I believe that this is a great opportunity for other students from the school to achieve the same.As a proud Edoofian,i humbly request if we can  schedule a call with the EdOOFA program director so that girls from st marys are given a chance to be part of this amazing society.

163 - 30 Jan 2024 09:27AM - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.  May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head‚Äôs Contact.

167 - 30 Jan 2024 01:39PM - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head‚Äôs Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

206 - 30 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects. There is no deadline for the project. There is no order in which you have to do the project. There is no limit on how much you have to do a project. There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects. It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.* Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.

However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare.  Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!

198 - 30 Jan 2024 09:24AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tinotenda!  Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.  Every day you have to come and say ""I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line. It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, ""I am a proud Edoofian.

200 - 30 Jan 2024 09:24AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:  Option 1: Monday and Thursday Option 2: Tuesday and Friday Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.  Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.  It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.

Our daily interactions have been invaluable, and the memories we've created will stay with me. I believe in the power of change for growth, and I'm eager to embrace this new chapter.  I want to express my deepest gratitude for being an inspiring mentor. Your wisdom and encouragement have been instrumental in my development. As I embark on this educational journey, I carry with me the lessons learned under your guidance.  Wishing you continued success and looking forward to crossing paths in the future.Thank you.

So today, I'm stepping in to assist you. If you're facing any challenges in your projects or if there are concerns you'd like to address, feel free to share them with me. Your success is our priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.  Remember your progress and development are our top priorities. Let's continue this journey together, and I'm here¬†if¬†you¬†require any assistance or guidance. Keep up the spirit and hard work, we are really proud of you!

However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare.  Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!

135 - 30 Jan 2024 04:47PM - +263 78 835 4179: On the Second video,  there was emphasis on how Edoofa is concerned about a student's success and that is not just about their academic success buh also their success after their education that includes making them employable and cultivating certain skills needed for one to be the first preference for a particular job or cultivating qualities that make Edoofians stand out of the crowd and it also focuses on making them independent by"" increasing their capacity for success ""
136 - 30 Jan 2024 04:51PM - +263 78 835 4179: For the third video,  it was highlighted for Edoofa took out the time to reach out to different schools trying to find the ones that stood out which could offer quality education and as our parents, they took a lot into account which made them reach at various conclusions pertaining to diffent schools so that is the reason why following instructions will help in showing how grateful we are for the effort and time put for the provision of such"" prestigious institutions ""
137 - 30 Jan 2024 04:55PM - +263 78 835 4179: And lastly but not least, the last video brought out the fact about how Edoofa issues out SOP which is the very backbone to one gettin admitted into any institutions as it highlights our strengths and weaknesses and why they should admit us because Edoofa would have taken out the time to interview student and analysing whether they qualify to be enrolled into the Edoofa Program thereby making it more realible as they are able to compose the SOP using the details and good traits gathered from interviews and counselling sessions
138 - 30 Jan 2024 04:56PM - +263 78 835 4179: I think that is most of it
139 - 30 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263788354179, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
140 - 30 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*  The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
141 - 30 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs Vision for You*  Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
142 - 30 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*  In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
143 - 30 Jan 2024 05:22PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.",No,Yes

2 hr 49 mins","92 - 30 Jan 2024 04:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts here, Let me help you understand the process here. As Mr. Abhinav have shared with you that Comfort has been offered the higher scholarship, due to which the cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $1200 - $1800 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
93 - 30 Jan 2024 04:17PM - Ashi Edoofa: The range of $500 - $1000 is for the registration fees not for the tuition fees please
94 - 30 Jan 2024 04:28PM - +265 999 86 06 62: I still have a request since Comfort's total fees is below the range of $6000-8000, you would have atleast considered her for a higher percentage of scholarship than the one you have offered now, atleast 80% above would have been much better. We are the middle class people and my earnings doesn't even get to $300 per month
95 - 30 Jan 2024 04:33PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your thought process here, I wanted to take a moment to address the scholarship percentage that Comfort has been offered is based on her academic performance and the response she provided in her SOP.  However, I also wanted to share that there is an opportunity to further reduce the cost of education through the Earn While You Learn program. This program allows students to self finances their education, which can greatly alleviate the financial burden of education. I hope this is helpful and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
96 - 30 Jan 2024 04:41PM - +265 999 86 06 62: I don't know what her feedback was on SOP, was it that we are capable of paying highest shortfall? I see that the shortfall here is above $1800 which is maximum on shortfalls. Yet on Comfort's offer $1850 is deemed to be the minimum. Ca you please explain,  I am still concerned on the higher cost.  Even though there's EWYL but this will mean the student will have sleepless nights to cover the shortfall <This message was edited>
97 - 30 Jan 2024 05:15PM - Ashi Edoofa: It appears that you have some concerns about the cost of her education. I want to assure you that we have provided all the necessary information about the expenses. However, I understand that these matters can be overwhelming. If there are specific details or questions you'd like to discuss, I'm here to address them and ensure that we are all on the same page.

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge. Having conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

10 - 16 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe,  I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.  As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
11 - 16 Jan 2024 07:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.  For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
12 - 30 Jan 2024 02:50PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Greetings Mr&Mrs Karavhina and Panasje, *I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa* I hope you all are doing well  If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction together after a frantic search for your name I ended up messaging you today. I understand your calibre and had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to *personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority through the best possible opportunities and exposures.*  Hence, I request you to come online and notify on this platform so that I can guide you ahead.

61 - 30 Jan 2024 10:43AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Shamiso, Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
62 - 30 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
63 - 30 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
64 - 30 Jan 2024 10:44AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?
65 - 30 Jan 2024 10:45AM - +263 78 206 9497: Yes
66 - 30 Jan 2024 11:06AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions regarding the process now?
67 - 30 Jan 2024 11:06AM - +263 78 206 9497: No
68 - 30 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted,  It is really crucial to reserve your University seat with the completion of the registration fees. So I have made a special request to our Academic Board and a recommendation for you to be reconsidered at the earliest. May I know, how far is your family prepared towards the University registration fee as of now?
69 - 30 Jan 2024 11:18AM - +263 78 206 9497: As of now my family is not prepared financially
70 - 30 Jan 2024 11:20AM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Noted Shamiso, I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this.

207 - 30 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning @263772632746! I hope you are doing well. I was not able to reply to you yesterday as I had to be in an urgent meeting. Before clearing out your query I want to inform you that admissions intake in the universities for the year 2025 is going to commence in August 2024 and over in November 2024. Now, if you wish to start the plan in November 2024, then there is no point in the plan, as the admissions are already going to be over.  I understand that you are having trouble managing your finances right now, but during the admission intake in August, if you fail to prepare for the registration fees at that time, then Ashley may miss out on the golden opportunity to jumpstart his career and fulfill his dream of becoming an electrical engineer. That is why the Edoofa Secure Plan ensures that students can come to India, and do not face any financial constraints in doing so.
208 - 30 Jan 2024 10:34AM - Dev Edoofa: Now may I please what challenges are you facing currently with the finances? PLease let us know as it will help us to help you tackle these situations and align ourselves accordingly. <This message was edited>
209 - 30 Jan 2024 10:37AM - +263 77 263 2746: We need to pay Ashley school fees and the fees for his brother. This alone consumes about $500 every month.  Ashley will write his examination in November 2024 that means we will be able not to save for his 2025 university education
210 - 30 Jan 2024 10:45AM - +263 77 263 2746: Its possible for us to pay the registration fees in September 2024 to November 2024 . But we can't manage $150 at the moment as it is still going to his secondary education
211 - 30 Jan 2024 01:13PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your challenges. As you suggest, if we start from September 2024 to November 2024 then, you will only be able to manage $450 which is not at all sufficient to handle the finances of Ashley's higher education. I hope you understand what I am trying to tell you?
212 - 30 Jan 2024 01:15PM - +263 77 263 2746: We are able to raise $250 each month for that period
213 - 30 Jan 2024 02:11PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about it. As mentioned before the amount that needs to be saved at the end of November is $1500, but according to your plan, you are only going to save $750 which is the exact half of the amount that needs to be saved, hence not sufficient for even paying the registration fees. I hope you understand the importance of the whole 10-month plan, it is designed to help you only with the finances and ensure students are able to achieve their dreams.

Now as you suggested you will start saving in September, but till then you would have already missed securing seats in universities because as mentioned, admissions are going to start in August. As a result, Ashley will miss out on this golden opportunity and all of your hard work will go in vain. I hope you are able to see from my perspective?

275 - 29 Jan 2024 03:36PM - +263 77 642 4175: From what we discussed we later realized that we might face challenges in the near future of failing to pay the fees taking into consideration that life is unpredictable so myself being the bread winner in the event that maybe l,m no longer going to work or maybe the worst i.e death and my daughter would have been admitted at a university in lndia it means she will not continue with her education and the worse part of it she will be abroad then it will be worse so other members suggested that we  do what we can afford i.e let her study locally becoz we misunderstood the concept of the scholarship
276 - 29 Jan 2024 05:48PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand @263776424175, that life is unpredictable, but I think this is all the more reason to plan according to the secure plan. The Edoofa Secure Plan is to help the parents prepare for any kind of financial constraints or any other problems in your life so that the student's future is not compromised. God forbids it, if anything happens to you, then Elexise may have more opportunities to grow herself here in India than in Zimbabwe. I hope you understand?

Since you mentioned that she was not able to secure the entire amount of money needed and she has been working for a while towards your education fee, I believe she must have been able to raise a part of the fee.

Considering this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
84 - 30 Jan 2024 05:10PM - +263 71 298 2024: last time, if I heard you correctly, I was told the fee can be paid even when I reach to India.
85 - 30 Jan 2024 05:11PM - +263 71 298 2024: how much did I pay?
86 - 30 Jan 2024 05:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: No @263712982024üèÖ, I think there might be a misunderstanding here. The remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee needs to be paid before your arrival in India. This ensures that all your enrollment formalities can be completed smoothly, allowing you to benefit from the admission facilities and the visa application process without any delays.  Your Edoofa Enrollment Fee was $350, out of which you've already paid $200. This leaves a balance of $150 and hence I wanted to reach out and understand if you have been able to make the payment of the same fee by now? If not, by when do you believe you would be able to deposit the fee so that I can alert the academic board?
87 - 30 Jan 2024 06:35PM - +263 71 298 2024: okay let me work it out and see
88 - 30 Jan 2024 06:43PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263712982024, that would be absolutely fine. Please take your time and have a discussion with your family and let us know about the same so that we can update the academic board as well. If I may ask, may I know by when would you be able to give us an update so that we can reconnect with each other accordingly?

45 - 30 Jan 2024 12:48PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship  $70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation  Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095  Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600  Misc- $300  Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100  Have you calculated this ? Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?

47 - 30 Jan 2024 01:07PM - +263 77 286 6195: The EWYL program makes it even more affordable
48 - 30 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-  Quality Education Conducive Environment Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills Technological Literacy and Attachments Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.   *However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
49 - 30 Jan 2024 01:56PM - +263 77 286 6195: I think it's because of lack of patience, an ability to try and financial strength
50 - 30 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
51 - 30 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
52 - 30 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
62 - 30 Jan 2024 03:16PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
63 - 30 Jan 2024 03:24PM - +263 77 286 6195: Alright please!! Once l have registered, l have to reserve my seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500-$750.  I will then be given an acceptance letter for Visa processes to be easy
64 - 30 Jan 2024 03:34PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
65 - 30 Jan 2024 03:34PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000  This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
66 - 30 Jan 2024 03:39PM - +263 77 286 6195: No, l understand
67 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?
68 - 30 Jan 2024 03:58PM - +263 77 286 6195: sure
69 - 30 Jan 2024 04:00PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship.

84 - 30 Jan 2024 12:48PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay
85 - 30 Jan 2024 12:48PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship  $70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation  Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095  Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600  Misc- $300  Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100  Have you calculated this ?  Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
86 - 30 Jan 2024 12:50PM - +263 77 650 4403: For now l can say all of the above isn't affordable for me at this point
87 - 30 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So what have you planned , will you sit home and stop studying ?
88 - 30 Jan 2024 12:54PM - +263 77 650 4403: Do you know that on that $2000-$3000 price that you offer if we add transport costs to India,passport fee and Visa they will all add up to around 1.200 which will add to that $3000 becoming $4200
89 - 30 Jan 2024 12:55PM - +263 77 650 4403: No l will not sit l will find somewhere affordable at low prices
90 - 30 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Visa cost is $89 and we have students has got flights for $400 .
91 - 30 Jan 2024 01:29PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: and here I have not calculated transportation if I add transportation it will exceed $5000 to study in Zimbabwe as internationally you only travel once where as locally you have to travel daily and daily travel costs more I hope you understand that ?
92 - 30 Jan 2024 01:35PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I have already provided you with links to universities where the local costs are significantly higher than studying abroad. It's important to note that the quality of education in Zimbabwe cannot be compared to that abroad, as employment numbers serve as a clear indicator. Let's consider the broader perspective as average salary in Zimbabwe is $1000-3000 where as in its $6000-9000

72 - 30 Jan 2024 12:33PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
73 - 30 Jan 2024 12:33PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
74 - 30 Jan 2024 12:33PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
75 - 30 Jan 2024 01:14PM - +263 78 309 6004: no that part is clear sir
76 - 30 Jan 2024 01:16PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?
75 - 30 Jan 2024 01:14PM - +263 78 309 6004: no that part is clear sir

43 - 30 Jan 2024 12:13PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please understand, I am here to provide guidance. It is crucial to note that a student cannot pursue Medicine without Biology. Anyone promising that your child can undertake Medicine without Biology is misleading you, as Biology forms the essential foundation for this field. There have been cases where students were unaware that the universities they enrolled in lacked credibility. After completing their courses, these students were unable to obtain a medical license. The criteria for medical practice are stringent, and medical boards do not easily grant doctor licenses. This is because dealing with someone's life directly necessitates prior knowledge. Would you trust someone with your life if they lack the necessary foundational understanding?
44 - 30 Jan 2024 12:15PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: If we were a fake organization, there would be no reason for us to withhold Medicine. We invest time repeatedly to explain because, as a legitimate organization, we are committed to ensuring that we don't waste your child's time and your investment. Please understand our genuine intention.

53 - 30 Jan 2024 11:21AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?

56 - 30 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
57 - 30 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
58 - 30 Jan 2024 07:00PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction.

This could offer you a well-rounded perspective that complements your understanding of law in countries like Ireland and the UK.  Moreover, studying in India often provides a cost-effective option without compromising on the quality of education.

81 - 30 Jan 2024 02:43PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah I'm ready sir
82 - 30 Jan 2024 02:48PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
83 - 30 Jan 2024 02:48PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah the information is accurate
84 - 30 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
85 - 30 Jan 2024 03:02PM - +263 78 506 3324: The registration fee is usually between 500 to 750 usd depending on the university, so if u can't pay all at once u can pay in portions
86 - 30 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
87 - 30 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000  This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
88 - 30 Jan 2024 03:37PM - +263 78 506 3324: I have clearly understood you sir
89 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.  Are you clear with the details?

116 - 30 Jan 2024 09:30AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
117 - 30 Jan 2024 09:31AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum 2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum 3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
118 - 30 Jan 2024 09:31AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

102 - 30 Jan 2024 12:54PM - +260 96 9739802: Correct
103 - 30 Jan 2024 01:08PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*  Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
104 - 30 Jan 2024 01:38PM - +260 763112850: Go through the registration process again
110 - 30 Jan 2024 01:53PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
111 - 30 Jan 2024 01:53PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
112 - 30 Jan 2024 01:53PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
113 - 30 Jan 2024 02:11PM - +260 763112850: Noted No questions yet
114 - 30 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +260 96 9739802: Greetings Me and my family has analyzed every offer presented to us and we have concluded that it is in our best Interest that she pursues her career from Zambia We appreciate the time and offers but unfortunately we won't go ahead In all decency would love a refund Kind regards Thank you so much

96 - 30 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*

58 - 30 Jan 2024 02:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,  1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum 2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum 3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
59 - 30 Jan 2024 02:37PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.  *Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*

62 - 30 Jan 2024 03:38PM - +263 77 312 4510: It's clear, when do universities normally require their fees?
63 - 30 Jan 2024 03:56PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: You will be update about the same shortly
64 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to you about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview Rangarirai and had a Video Call with  Parents.

33 - 30 Jan 2024 08:56AM - +27 62 910 6062: We have to do  things which  we can  manage  ourselves because  we have  a lot do it's  notonly  about Recall s  education  but we have  other  kids  attending  schools  so please  I can't  manage
34 - 30 Jan 2024 08:57AM - +27 62 910 6062: Schooling  is the same  whether  in India  or Africa  but what's  important  a child  is attending  schools
35 - 30 Jan 2024 09:28AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 I understand that you must be facing financial challenges, But I guess you are looking things from a different perspective altogether
36 - 30 Jan 2024 09:28AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail  While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
37 - 30 Jan 2024 09:29AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
38 - 30 Jan 2024 09:35AM - +27 62 910 6062: No Mr Shubbman  offcourse  my country  it's  in crisis  but I can't  run away from  my country  at the same time  it's  not only Recall  but many  students  .Recall did  learn  in  Zimbabwe  from  zero  grade up to A level  still  in the same  country  so wat has changed
39 - 30 Jan 2024 09:38AM - +27 62 910 6062: We can't  afford  thus all . I have  my sister 's two kids at MSU from  last year on the 27 Feb they  going  back  to school  and it's  an advantage  to me because  I will  be paying  half half  unlike  you when  you need money  you just  say put money tomorrow
41 - 30 Jan 2024 09:41AM - +27 62 910 6062: Do you mean  after  educating  the students  you give  them  jobs  . We know  you going  to sent them back  home  for them  to find  themselves  jobs
42 - 30 Jan 2024 09:41AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Shall I help you first clarify the grey areas you are getting confused at before you make any decisions?
43 - 30 Jan 2024 09:42AM - +27 62 910 6062: This  is about  money  issues   Mr Shubbman  not political  issues  of the  countries  better  for him to learn  in SA
44 - 30 Jan 2024 09:43AM - +27 62 910 6062: There  are millions of  students  learning  locally  in Africa
45 - 30 Jan 2024 09:59AM - +27 62 910 6062: There is  a lot  of things  to do for Recall to access  lndian  universities  of which  we can't  afford  .l was home  December  and we sit down  to calculate  how  we have  an answer to  what  better for  us remember  how much  is a plane  to lndia  from  Zimbabwe  a lot of money
46 - 30 Jan 2024 10:43AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @27629106062 During our Counselling Sessions I specifically recall that you mentioned why you wanted Recall to study abroad, the reason you stated was that the infrastructure back their in Africa was not strong enough to provide Recall with a good job opportunity please!
47 - 30 Jan 2024 10:45AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have counselled ten's  of thousands of students and I am aware of the issues a parent and students face, After multiple interactions with them, I have come to noticed that even after completing their degrees in Africa, People work in a supermarket, or a sim card seller or working at a gas station
48 - 30 Jan 2024 10:46AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. *But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education*. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.
49 - 30 Jan 2024 10:46AM - +27 62 910 6062: I think  I am done  Mr Shubbman  I can't  afford
50 - 30 Jan 2024 10:47AM - +27 62 910 6062: I don't think  you can push  or force the situation  I can't  pay  such lots of money",No,Yes

Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others.

92 - 30 Jan 2024 01:49PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-

126 - 30 Jan 2024 01:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Adonis. I hope everything is well on your end. How are you all doing today?
127 - 30 Jan 2024 01:26PM - +263 71 480 1825: We are fine how are you?
128 - 30 Jan 2024 01:27PM - +263 77 168 2406: We are okay. How are you
129 - 30 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am fine too, thank you for asking. Based on our previous conversation, we were discussing the plan for the remaining 10 months of the Financial Secure Plan. Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
130 - 30 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
131 - 30 Jan 2024 01:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

136 - 30 Jan 2024 02:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Once the 10 months are completed, our team will guide you and give the relevant information required to open a bank account. May I know if this was helpful?

138 - 30 Jan 2024 02:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad that it was helpful. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
139 - 30 Jan 2024 02:47PM - +263 77 168 2406: Yes we understand
140 - 30 Jan 2024 03:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their family the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know when you think you'll have the discussion with your family? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

36 - 30 Jan 2024 05:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are all fine. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, you had confirmed your chosen course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
37 - 30 Jan 2024 05:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
38 - 30 Jan 2024 05:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

40 - 30 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
41 - 30 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
42 - 30 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
43 - 30 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
44 - 30 Jan 2024 06:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.",No,Yes

116 - 30 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
117 - 30 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
118 - 30 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
119 - 30 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

120 - 30 Jan 2024 05:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
121 - 30 Jan 2024 05:49PM - +263 77 332 9674: Yes it is exactly what we would like to have upon our future
122 - 30 Jan 2024 06:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the Financial Secure Plan. I wish you a blessed day ahead!

92 - 30 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
93 - 30 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes.

96 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
97 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
98 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
99 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education.

100 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
98 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
99 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education.

101 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
102 - 30 Jan 2024 02:20PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes that's all we want
103 - 30 Jan 2024 02:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
104 - 30 Jan 2024 02:41PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yea sure
105 - 30 Jan 2024 03:09PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
106 - 30 Jan 2024 03:09PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
107 - 30 Jan 2024 03:09PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?

To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29 - 30 Jan 2024 12:10PM - +263 78 111 7306: Sorry  to ask but what does BA LLB stands for
30 - 30 Jan 2024 12:10PM - +263 78 111 7306: And about arriving in lndia during August 2025 it's true
31 - 30 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the confusion. The course you are going to pursue is BCom, am I correct?

33 - 30 Jan 2024 01:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
34 - 30 Jan 2024 01:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
35 - 30 Jan 2024 01:44PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

54 - 30 Jan 2024 03:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
55 - 30 Jan 2024 03:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
56 - 30 Jan 2024 03:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?

74 - 30 Jan 2024 06:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month.

113 - 30 Jan 2024 05:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well. During our previous conversation, you confirmed your course and year of intake. Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
114 - 30 Jan 2024 05:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
115 - 30 Jan 2024 05:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes.

If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?

During our last interaction, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. As you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
135 - 30 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.

93 - 30 Jan 2024 04:11PM - +263 77 346 1535: Yes we have gone through the agreement. I have a question on the instalments. Let's say I happen to have $300 in a particular month and I deposit it, will that be taken as 2 months done and I can skip payment in the following month?
94 - 30 Jan 2024 05:01PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, in such a case you will be allowed to skip the payment of the next month. However, you will need to let us know about the same so that we can update you profile accordingly and carry out the projections accurately.

If you wish to deposit $100 in the first month, and deposit $200 the next month, that is also completely acceptable provided that you are able to give us a plan stating the amount you will be able to deposit every month. I hope this helps with your query?

197 - 29 Jan 2024 10:04AM - +263 77 242 6991: Good morning Madam. We are  very well today. As Kundai's parents we are still pondering on how much can we afford to contribute since our financial position is not sound.
198 - 29 Jan 2024 10:23AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are all doing well. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. May I know what has caused this uncertainty?
199 - 30 Jan 2024 12:44PM - +263 77 242 6991: Good afternoon Ms Siddhi Singh. I managed to pay part of the enrolment fee from money that I had served after a long time and the balance I will be able to pay before the deadline as stipulated. The monthly payment of $150 for the next 10 months will be a challenge for me because I and my wife are self employed. We do not have a fixed salary which we can budget fairly well. Our income fluctuates. Sometimes it meets our daily needs sometimes it doesn't.We depend  on clients served at that particular month and work done. So we need your assistance on this situation Madam. I really want to fulfill my daughter's educational aspirations.
200 - 30 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand that your monthly income is dependant on your clients. In such a case, you have the flexibility of deciding the date and amount you are willing to pay in the next 10 months. Our end goal is to ensure that by the end of the first 10 months, you are able to save $1500 for Kundai's education. However, since it is essential to maintain a track of all the payments to ensure timely and smooth progress, we will require you to let us know the amount you will be able to pay each month. Hence, you may suggest a payment plan with flexible amounts that you can pay every month, which will ultimately sum up to $1500 by the end of the 10 months. I hope you are following?",No,No

We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.  In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelors in Computer Application and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
273 - 30 Jan 2024 10:20AM - +263 77 326 9699: Yes  the information you have is correct.lf all goes well we are planning for him to arrive in lndia in August 2024
274 - 30 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
275 - 30 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
276 - 30 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
277 - 30 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
278 - 30 Jan 2024 11:32AM - +263 77 326 9699: Thanks for your elaboration Ms Siddh

279 - 30 Jan 2024 11:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
280 - 30 Jan 2024 11:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
281 - 30 Jan 2024 11:59AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
282 - 30 Jan 2024 02:10PM - +263 77 326 9699: Yes she explained about it
283 - 30 Jan 2024 02:34PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?

We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

86 - 30 Jan 2024 01:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.  In the meantime, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Travel and Tourism) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
87 - 30 Jan 2024 02:17PM - +263 78 725 5242: Yes, that's correct - I'm planning to arrive in India in August 2025 to begin my studies. The program I've selected is the BA (Hons) Travel and Tourism Management, and I'm really excited about the opportunity to learn more about this field.
88 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
89 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
90 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
83 - 30 Jan 2024 12:59PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?

47 - 30 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
48 - 30 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?

143 - 29 Jan 2024 01:51PM - +263 78 397 9366: Ok thank you very much
144 - 29 Jan 2024 02:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Biotechnology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
145 - 30 Jan 2024 08:29AM - +263 78 810 0185: Good morning how are you doing. Sorry for being absent yesterday my phone was off due to power challenges but today i will be available for our session.
146 - 30 Jan 2024 08:31AM - +263 78 810 0185: I have selected Msc (Biotechnology) currently i am about to finish my B. Sc ( Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology). And everything is accurate except the entry level it's Masters.
147 - 30 Jan 2024 11:01AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyashadzashe. I hope you are doing well today. Kindly excuse me for stating the wrong course and thank you for pointing that out to me. It is quite alright please, I understand that you were facing power challenges due to which we were unable to connect yesterday. However I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, how has your day been going so far?
148 - 30 Jan 2024 11:09AM - +263 78 810 0185: I glad to hear from you today. I am doing ok how about you. Thank you for asking
149 - 30 Jan 2024 11:12AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing okay. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving ahead with today's discussion, based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
150 - 30 Jan 2024 11:12AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
151 - 30 Jan 2024 11:12AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
155 - 30 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
156 - 30 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
157 - 30 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
158 - 30 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
159 - 30 Jan 2024 11:18AM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes i have gone through all the points and it's a great plan which can be helpful if paid attention to and followed.
160 - 30 Jan 2024 11:50AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
161 - 30 Jan 2024 11:52AM - +263 78 810 0185: I fully understood everything and as a family we put measures in place to curb the challenges.
162 - 30 Jan 2024 12:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
163 - 30 Jan 2024 12:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
164 - 30 Jan 2024 12:00PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
174 - 30 Jan 2024 12:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
175 - 30 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
176 - 30 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
177 - 30 Jan 2024 12:14PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes that's all accurate
178 - 30 Jan 2024 12:15PM - +263 78 810 0185: The exchange rateüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠it changes every day without any pattern or trend
179 - 30 Jan 2024 12:56PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Indeed Nyashadzashe. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
180 - 30 Jan 2024 01:00PM - +263 78 810 0185: Yes sure
181 - 30 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
182 - 30 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
183 - 30 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
176 - 30 Jan 2024 12:14PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?

186 - 30 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that. I have taken a note of the same. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
187 - 30 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.
188 - 30 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
189 - 30 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
190 - 30 Jan 2024 05:59PM - +263 78 810 0185: It's actually a good thing. So before paying the stated amount of upto $1500 i won't receive offer letters??

Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.

After the completion of the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month of the plan, during which you will be required to deposit money in your newly opened account, the remaining months you will have the option to save the money in your bank account or with us. The 4 months' deposit in the bank ensure that your bank statements complete the VISA requirement. If you decide to deposit your money with us after the completion of the 4 months, it will be used for Ryan's higher education expense exclusively. I hope this helps with your query?

61 - 29 Jan 2024 11:16AM - +263 78 324 9174: Morning Ms, we're all fine, thank you and you
62 - 30 Jan 2024 11:04AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Samuel. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you yesterday as I got occupied with some urgent work-related emergency. However, I am glad that we can reconnect today to move forward with our discussion. Before we begin, I wanted to ask how your day has been going so far?
63 - 30 Jan 2024 11:20AM - +263 78 324 9174: Morning Edoofa, we're all fine and you
64 - 30 Jan 2024 11:51AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
65 - 30 Jan 2024 12:11PM - +263 78 324 9174: I am not familiar with what SLICE CON is
66 - 30 Jan 2024 12:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
67 - 30 Jan 2024 12:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
68 - 30 Jan 2024 12:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
75 - 30 Jan 2024 12:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
76 - 30 Jan 2024 12:20PM - +263 78 324 9174: Thank you so much for sharing this with us
77 - 30 Jan 2024 12:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
78 - 30 Jan 2024 12:31PM - +263 78 324 9174: I would like to know much more about the quiz schoolaship which was held in Botswana and Samuel's school won, and Edoofa gave, how's it/when that schoolaship going to work
79 - 30 Jan 2024 01:13PM - +263 78 324 9174: Sorry maybe l am asking irrelevant questions, it's just that my son was one of the students, just wanted to know.
80 - 30 Jan 2024 01:40PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this information with me. That is wonderful news! I am sure that you must be proud that Samual was one of the few students who won and also had the opportunity to come on live television. How are you feeling about this accomplishment?

Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
88 - 30 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
89 - 30 Jan 2024 02:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

102 - 30 Jan 2024 03:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
103 - 30 Jan 2024 03:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

103 - 30 Jan 2024 03:52PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
104 - 30 Jan 2024 04:05PM - +263 78 838 3513: Sure Ms. Siddhi
105 - 30 Jan 2024 04:06PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yes , I'm wondering about the details of that Financial Secure Plan
108 - 30 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
109 - 30 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
110 - 30 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
111 - 30 Jan 2024 04:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
112 - 30 Jan 2024 04:17PM - +263 78 838 3513: That's a good plan, we also wish to have
113 - 30 Jan 2024 05:05PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
114 - 30 Jan 2024 05:08PM - +263 78 838 3513: Yah sure

117 - 30 Jan 2024 10:34AM - +263 71 554 0651: Nice thanks for sharing the experience.
118 - 30 Jan 2024 10:40AM - +263 71 554 0651: There were no queries as such, it's a good plan but my only concern was about the extra charge when depositing that $150 to the bank.
119 - 30 Jan 2024 11:24AM - +263 71 554 0651: Since the financial secure plan is mandatory I don't know if there is another way of reducing that cost because 12% is a bit too much. That's my only worry.
120 - 30 Jan 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shyleen. I hope everything is well on your end. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I understand please. I would like to highlight that the payment mode being provided by us are done through local associates who offer to help in making payments through their bank accounts, which has 12.5% international transfer charges. If you have to make the same payment through your own bank account, the international transfer charges are at least 18%.
121 - 30 Jan 2024 12:55PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Moreover, keeping your finances in mind, we also offer a waiver of your remaining $150 enrollment fee. These additional benefits can be availed through the Financial Secure Plan, and we have carefully introduced this plan for the students to ensure that they do not face any financial burden by the time they arrive in India for their higher education. I hope this was helpful in clearing your query regarding the payment charges?
122 - 30 Jan 2024 01:08PM - +263 71 554 0651: Okay thank you I now do understand and thank you for breaking this down for me.
123 - 30 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that this was helpful. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
124 - 30 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.

129 - 30 Jan 2024 03:15PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, do you think it would be suitable for you to set the date as the 7th of every month?

I was unable to respond to your message yesterday as our operational hours had concluded, however I am glad that we can reconnect today. Before we proceed with our discussion, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today? <This message was edited>
109 - 30 Jan 2024 04:23PM - +263 78 745 9092: Good afternoon

113 - 30 Jan 2024 05:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
114 - 30 Jan 2024 05:23PM - +263 78 745 9092: Yes you are correct
115 - 30 Jan 2024 06:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
116 - 30 Jan 2024 06:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.

117 - 30 Jan 2024 06:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?

For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
70 - 30 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
71 - 30 Jan 2024 02:07PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

In such a case, you can connect with him to know about his experience at the event! Next year, you will also be present here to attend your first SLICE Con'24 and get opportunities to learn and grow from industry specialists themselves!
75 - 30 Jan 2024 02:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to decide on a monthly deposit date Simon?

78 - 30 Jan 2024 03:26PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe there has been a misunderstanding. Under Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan you are required to deposit the monthly $150 amount to Edoofa for the first 10 months, after the completion of which you are required to open a Nostro account under Simon's name. With the Financial Secure Plan, you get to avail benefits like $150 waiver of your remaining enrollment fee amount along with the flexibility of choosing the monthly deposit date. If you choose to save the money in your account, I am afraid you will not be eligible to avail these benefits. May I know if we are on the same page here?

81 - 30 Jan 2024 04:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program has worked with over 250 universities, all of which are recognized by UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education). While it is impractical to list all these universities, let me share a few notable ones that excel in exposure, affordability, culture, and academics and the ones we will be considering for Tauya's education:  - Lovely Professional University - Colleges under Uttarakhand Technical University - Colleges under Punjab Technical University - Galgotias University - MVN University

To avoid risking your son's higher education during such difficult times, this plan will be beneficial for you. Moreover, with the Financial Secure Plan, you also get the added benefit of the $150 waive off.

37 - 30 Jan 2024 02:49PM - +263 78 547 2288: Yes I want to know how the plan works
38 - 30 Jan 2024 03:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
39 - 30 Jan 2024 03:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
40 - 30 Jan 2024 03:16PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
41 - 30 Jan 2024 03:17PM - +263 78 547 2288: Yes I agree with you
42 - 30 Jan 2024 03:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
43 - 30 Jan 2024 03:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
44 - 30 Jan 2024 03:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
45 - 30 Jan 2024 04:31PM - +263 78 547 2288: Yes I can . I think it the best idea . I will talk to my mom . Am sure we will be able to start budgeting next month . Since January is already at the end
46 - 30 Jan 2024 05:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.

47 - 30 Jan 2024 05:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
48 - 30 Jan 2024 05:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
49 - 30 Jan 2024 05:21PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?

I hope that by then you will be able to complete these tasks and share them with me. Until then, please take care and have a blessed day ahead!

138 - 30 Jan 2024 03:01PM - +263 77 246 9142: Reference to the outstanding task, Tafadzwa is still working on the task and still to provide answers to the questions you send yesterday. She will indicate approximate completion date in the evening.
139 - 30 Jan 2024 03:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. In such a case, I will be waiting for Tafadzwa to send in the responses, and in the meanwhile we may proceed with our discussion.
140 - 30 Jan 2024 03:32PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
141 - 30 Jan 2024 03:45PM - +263 77 246 9142: This information is very correct
142 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for their higher education abroad.
143 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.

144 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
145 - 30 Jan 2024 04:40PM - +263 77 246 9142: WE will be grateful to get the details of this financial plan to help us prepare
146 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

146 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
147 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  2. *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
148 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 3. *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  4. *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
149 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 5. *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.  6. *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
150 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 7. *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.  8. *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

151 - 30 Jan 2024 05:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.  It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
152 - 30 Jan 2024 05:57PM - +263 77 532 6491: Good day .The financial secure plan we were aware of is EWYL program which Tafadzwa wish to participate in.

75 - 30 Jan 2024 02:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa. I hope everything is well on your end. I was hoping to get a response form your end yesterday, but it seems like due to some reason we were unable to move ahead with our discussion. Before we proceed with our discussion today, I would like to check in on you and your family. How are you all doing today?
76 - 30 Jan 2024 02:34PM - +263 77 368 2556: We are fine sir , how are you
77 - 30 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am well too, thank you for asking. In our previous conversation, we were discussing about the Financial Secure Plan. You mentioned that you had the opportunity to discuss the same with your family, however you were not able to come to an agreement. May I know if you have any queries about the plan that you wish to share with me?
78 - 30 Jan 2024 02:56PM - +263 77 368 2556: The only querry was that we may have problems with depositing  the $150 into the Edoofa account every month, won't we have problems if we fail to do so after paying for some months
79 - 30 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. May I know what are your concerns related to depositing the amount to Edoofa every month?
80 - 30 Jan 2024 03:33PM - +263 77 368 2556: What if fail to raise the money won't it affect the whole plan
81 - 30 Jan 2024 03:35PM - +263 77 368 2556: Lets say I pay for three months then face a problem which may need money and I fail to deposit the money what happens to the plan
82 - 30 Jan 2024 04:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. With Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you are planning one step ahead and preparing for your future finances in advance. However, I understand that sometimes unforeseen situations may cause challenges in paying the deposit on the agreed date. In such a case, I believe that you are going to discuss the same with me, and will let me know the amount that you will be able to deposit in that particular month. In such a case, we will discuss how that amount can be clubbed and adjusted with a deposit in the next few months. If you fail to deposit any amount of money, there is going to be a penalty imposed on that month, which varies for every month. With Edoofa's Financial Secure Plan, you get the flexibility of deciding the deposit date, also while availing the benefit of the $150 waiver and saving $15 every month by not depositing the same amount in your bank. I hope we are together in this?

173 - 30 Jan 2024 02:10PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thomas  Please, how are you doing today? With regards to our discussion yesterday, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you are available for us to have a brief conversation?
174 - 30 Jan 2024 02:34PM - +263 78 746 3056: Good afternoon.we are going good and you. We are available so we can have the conversation

176 - 30 Jan 2024 03:08PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing well and are available for us to connect with each other. Before reaching out to you today, I was going through pictures and videos from Edoofa's very first SLICE CON held last week, and that sparked my curiosity about whether you are familiar with what SLICE CON is or not?
177 - 30 Jan 2024 03:34PM - +263 78 746 3056: Iam not familiar with that
178 - 30 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, Let me tell you a bit about the same.  Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
179 - 30 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
180 - 30 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
186 - 30 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
187 - 30 Jan 2024 03:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let me know once you are able to go through the messages about the SLICE CON, along with the images and videos shared with you. This was indeed a momentous step for all of our students, making them employable ready and giving them access to the right opportunities for their careers ahead.
188 - 30 Jan 2024 03:56PM - +263 78 746 3056: I have gone through them. This was indeed a great conference l must say
189 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly, Thomas. Also, regarding the discussion we had the other day about the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, I wanted to follow up on our last conversation. Have you, as a family, been able to discuss it? If so, I would like to understand how the discussion went. What were their thoughts about it? Did they have any specific queries or concerns that you would like us to address?
190 - 30 Jan 2024 04:01PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok so we did have a discussion and during this discussion my father  liked the idea and recommended it. He had a few questions but l was able to answer him
191 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, Parents and Thomas. For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
192 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
193 - 30 Jan 2024 04:30PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
194 - 30 Jan 2024 04:36PM - +263 78 746 3056: Ok  we will decide and tell you when father comes home from work

It has been over 10 days since we began the admission process, and since we are unable to connect with each other we are running behind schedule. Trinity's batchmates who began their admission process alongside have completed the process and are currently waiting for their offer letters. As Trinity's admission officer, I am a bit concerned about the timely completion of your admission cycle so that you do not miss out on this scholarship opportunity. May I know if you have been facing any challenges due to which it has not been possible on your end to connect with us?

However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 18 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?

215 - 30 Jan 2024 10:42AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Trinity. Could you kindly share a screenshot with me Trinity? In case you forgot to take one, you may revisit the link and take a screenshot of the screen and share the same.
216 - 30 Jan 2024 10:43AM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok let me do so
217 - 30 Jan 2024 10:55AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Trinity. I will be waiting for your response.
218 - 30 Jan 2024 11:21AM - +263 77 623 5022: Sorry, our network is very  low so the link couldn't open but l promise once the network is active , l will do as you say , sorry for the delays
219 - 30 Jan 2024 11:53AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, Trinity. In such a case, let us move forward with out discussion for today. However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 18 February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
220 - 30 Jan 2024 11:57AM - +263 77 623 5022: Thank you very much for the reminder, we are busy preparing for that money
221 - 30 Jan 2024 12:04PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.  In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
222 - 30 Jan 2024 12:19PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes it is accurate
223 - 30 Jan 2024 12:19PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
228 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok thank you for the information
229 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
230 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalise their registration process.
231 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counsellor has also discussed the registration fee during your counselling sessions, correct?
232 - 30 Jan 2024 12:28PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes , we discussed about it during our counselling sessions
233 - 30 Jan 2024 12:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 - $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
234 - 30 Jan 2024 01:01PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes we are
235 - 30 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
236 - 30 Jan 2024 01:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum 2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) 3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum  *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
237 - 30 Jan 2024 01:46PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university‚Äôs first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?

238 - 30 Jan 2024 01:49PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes
239 - 30 Jan 2024 02:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year‚Äôs fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
234 - 30 Jan 2024 01:01PM - +263 77 623 5022: Yes we are

240 - 30 Jan 2024 02:13PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid in two instalments of $325 each. The initial instalment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly instalments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
241 - 30 Jan 2024 02:22PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok, thank you for informing me such important things
242 - 30 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
243 - 30 Jan 2024 02:43PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.

This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
245 - 30 Jan 2024 02:59PM - +263 77 623 5022: Ok

254 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.  Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
255 - 30 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavour for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.  As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
256 - 30 Jan 2024 04:02PM - +263 77 623 5022: Im very exited to hear that
257 - 30 Jan 2024 04:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realised that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
258 - 30 Jan 2024 04:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.  We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
259 - 30 Jan 2024 05:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!

For the current round of students, there are only 27 seats available for the students who can benefit from the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan.  Since you have been one of the most dedicated students, and I see you have great aspirations, I wanted you to be a part of the same set of students and start with your future planning the right way.
130 - 30 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Also, as this plan commences from the month of January, for the efficient implementation of this plan, we need to decide on a fixed date on which you will deposit $150 every month. This will provide you with the flexibility to align your finances accordingly.
131 - 30 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?
132 - 30 Jan 2024 12:34PM - +263 78 126 2807: Good afternoon to you, too My parents said they can start depositing the money by the end of February, is that okay?

131 - 30 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Our complete focus is on providing students and parents with the best ways to avail themselves of these opportunities. We understand that every parent may not be able to make the payment on our specified date. Therefore, considering this situation, we allow them to decide the payment date according to their comfort. In light of the same, may I know the fixed date every month on which you will deposit $150?

66 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
67 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
60 - 30 Jan 2024 01:33PM - +263 77 263 6611: We are good thanks for asking, our daughter Wilma is back in school where we alluded last time that they're not allowed any gadgets eg cellphones etc.
61 - 30 Jan 2024 01:58PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing good. I understand please, thank you for letting me know. In her absence, we can continue with our discussion and when Wilma is available she will have the opportunity to go through the details. In such a case, shall we proceed with our discussion for today? <This message was edited>
62 - 30 Jan 2024 01:59PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes please we may proceed
63 - 30 Jan 2024 02:18PM - Sidhi Edoofa: During our previous discussion, we were talking about the details of Financial Secure Plan. Considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
64 - 30 Jan 2024 02:19PM - +263 77 451 2698: Yes Please let's  proceed <This message was edited>
65 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay before your due date.
66 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
67 - 30 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?

69 - 30 Jan 2024 02:54PM - +263 77 451 2698: Our understanding is that we completed the   Edoofa enrolment  process and we submitted all the documents required for the statement of purpose That is the stage we are at

77 - 30 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. Thank you for bringing that to my notice. Moving forward, I have taken a note of the same. In reference to your sessions with Ms. Ashi, she was under the impression that your admission intake year is 2024, and during our conversation it was highlighted that your admission intake year is 2025, and hence I took over the duties as your admission officer. For the 2025 intake, the offer letter from the universities will be processed by them post the month of August. In the meanwhile, Edoofa is helping the students in planning their finances by offering the Financial Secure Plan, to ensure that the student does not face any unforeseen challenges or difficulties when they arrive in India for their higher education., which we are discussing currently. I hope we are on the same page regarding this?

80 - 30 Jan 2024 04:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that ma'am and sir. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
81 - 30 Jan 2024 04:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fees.

82 - 30 Jan 2024 04:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
83 - 30 Jan 2024 04:47PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
84 - 30 Jan 2024 04:50PM - +263 77 451 2698: Can you please elaborate further here madam <This message was edited>

87 - 30 Jan 2024 06:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The university application process will begin from the month of August, when the universities begin accepting applications for the 2025 intake. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan helps you to plan your educational journey in advance so that you do not face any difficulties or challenges when it is time to pay for Wilma's registration fees. I hope we are together in this?

I have been equally wondering whether you were still checking on the modalities of giving us a life lime response to Melisa's request especially that she had written to your good offices over her legibility to continue after the three points she got out her A'levels recently.

Right now she is not home since she had requested for a refreshing environment at her sister in-law since she was not so sure if she was going to be responded to by your good offices thereto. I am very sorry that you were out of office due to the reason you have shared with us this morning. Having said thus, Melisa is very expectantly looking forward to your update Mum.  Regards,  Parent

If I were at your place I would keep two options open for myself rather than just waiting for the one.

Hence evaluation at every university takes time and once we receive updates from other universities then only we will be able to notify you however, in the meantime if you miss this opportunity you will not be able to reserve your seat with this university again since you would already have missed on the opportunity and the university has to be fair to all the students as well. And it being your admission officer I would suggest you make use of the transfer option explained to you it is always better to have the opportunity secured than be lost.

Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.  2. Journalist For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.  3. Administrative Support Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.  4. Rehabilitation Counsellor If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.  5. Family Counsellor Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that‚Äôs why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.  6. Survey Researcher As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.  7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.  8. Policy Analyst Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That‚Äôs why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population  9. Media Planner A media planner‚Äôs job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

174 - 30 Jan 2024 09:56AM - Arshita: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:  *Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.  *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.  *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.  *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.  *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.  In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.  *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.  In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

273 - 30 Jan 2024 09:18AM - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning Mrs Mercy
274 - 30 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Garima Edoofa: Mrs Mercy, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program.  One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
275 - 30 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Garima Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors  1. Student himself/herself 2. FAMILY 3. EDOOFA PROGAM  Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs.  Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
276 - 30 Jan 2024 09:19AM - Garima Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education.  *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

So apart from the Enrollment fee they wouldn't pay anything separate for their application fee or SOP fee!  So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:  *1. Guaranteed Scholarship* *2. Application fee of all the Edoofa‚Äôs Associated Universities* *3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted* *4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student* *5. Earn While You Learn Program‚Äôs Training* *6. Visa Assistance*  I hope now you will be in a better position to relate how Exactly Edoofa is trying to bring the change in the Admission process for International Students?

227 - 30 Jan 2024 12:19PM - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).   Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.   The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.  However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
224 - 30 Jan 2024 09:32AM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don‚Äôt you think so?
225 - 30 Jan 2024 10:47AM - +260 776321828: Yes i do
226 - 30 Jan 2024 12:19PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
227 - 30 Jan 2024 12:19PM - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).   Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.   The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.  However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

391 - 30 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Gurvinder: @263772839309 you see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities.  So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?
392 - 30 Jan 2024 03:08PM - +263 77 283 9309: Its ok sir you can share

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23 - 30 Jan 2024 02:24PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*",No,No

139 - 29 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Gurvinder: Mr Muke, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

63 - 30 Jan 2024 12:18PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
64 - 30 Jan 2024 12:18PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.  Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa‚Äôs Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.  Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:- *Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.* *Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
197 - 30 Jan 2024 10:15AM - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
198 - 30 Jan 2024 10:17AM - +263 78 271 4456: Let me read through

200 - 30 Jan 2024 11:01AM - +263 78 271 4456: From what I understood stage 5 is for finacial planning  for the entire Tertiary Education
201 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*  *NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year‚Äôs annual fee*
202 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
203 - 30 Jan 2024 12:23PM - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
204 - 30 Jan 2024 01:02PM - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you  as I have seen it you said registration  fee is part of first year fees so does it mean the university notifies of the deduction or it's just automatic deduction

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

328 - 30 Jan 2024 09:31AM - Gurvinder: Oh, well @263784245544 , you see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities.  So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?
329 - 30 Jan 2024 09:39AM - +263 78 424 5544: Absolutely, I will do so through Mukuru platform Kindly send the details

213 - 30 Jan 2024 12:38PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
214 - 30 Jan 2024 01:51PM - +263 78 035 0326: Yes I am
215 - 30 Jan 2024 01:51PM - Gurvinder: @263780350326 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
216 - 30 Jan 2024 01:53PM - +263 78 035 0326: Ok interesting

78 - 30 Jan 2024 12:10PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

80 - 30 Jan 2024 12:49PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Rackel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

320 - 29 Jan 2024 01:55PM - Gurvinder: Runyararo, what I meant to ask was that since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
321 - 29 Jan 2024 03:02PM - +263 77 717 1803: Any of the 2 Mr Gurvinder The 2nd one has 12.5% additional cost but is the easiest because we have an FBC Bank branch in my town. I prefer the 1st mode if you can help me on how to go about it because there is no additional cost. I will also do my research on the 1st mode but I look forward to your help. I will pay by Friday the 2nd of February; I will have done my research. Thank you.
322 - 30 Jan 2024 07:55AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!  *‚ÄúThe best way to predict your future is to create it.""*  Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

324 - 30 Jan 2024 09:31AM - Gurvinder: Should I brief you about it?
325 - 30 Jan 2024 10:02AM - +263 77 717 1803: Yes, you may.
326 - 30 Jan 2024 12:40PM - Gurvinder: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
327 - 30 Jan 2024 12:41PM - Gurvinder: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

338 - 30 Jan 2024 01:16PM - Gurvinder: Alright @263777171803, meanwhile as you know that the due date of the formalities is of 3rd February, however it would be of great benefit for you incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st January.
339 - 30 Jan 2024 01:16PM - Gurvinder: While I do understand that the deadline is of 3rd February, the key benefit you as a child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January 2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.

22 - 30 Jan 2024 01:10PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Shantel, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23 - 30 Jan 2024 01:57PM - +263 71 585 4470: I dont think so especially the number 2 metric
24 - 30 Jan 2024 01:59PM - Gurvinder: Now Shantel, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

202 - 29 Jan 2024 02:28PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
203 - 29 Jan 2024 11:23PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*.

357 - 30 Jan 2024 10:23AM - Gurvinder: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 10% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.
358 - 30 Jan 2024 10:23AM - Gurvinder: The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $385 ($350 + $35 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  US Dollar Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  Zambian Kwacha Account  Bank Name: Indo Zambia Bank Branch: Jacaranda Account Name: Penmal Connect Limited Account Number: 0222030000591 Swift Code: INZAZMLX Sort Code: 090122

The Image above is from our recent meeting with the Ministries of Education of Zambia, Penmal Connect along with our founders Mr Angad and Mr Avreen. This meeting was scheduled in order to provide more scholarship opportunities for the student of Zambia to Study abroad.  *So you can connect with them as well once you get the time to get further clarity about the program and its procedures.*

363 - 30 Jan 2024 11:34AM - Gurvinder: Sure @260977418333, meanwhile, as you know the due date of the formalities 3rd February, however it would be of great benefit for Thabo incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st January. <This message was edited>
364 - 30 Jan 2024 11:35AM - Gurvinder: While I do understand that the deadline is of 3rd February, the key benefit Thabo as a child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of January 2024. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.

He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.

257 - 30 Jan 2024 04:19PM - +263 71 227 4883: Section 6 My inspirational story is about the story of Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google? He's a modern-day pioneer in the field of computer science. Sergey Brin was born in 1973 and studied computer science at Stanford University. He met Larry Page, who shared his passion for the internet. Together, they founded Google in 1998. Brin played a key role in developing the company's groundbreaking PageRank algorithm, which revolutionized the way we search for information online. Brin and Page also developed many other technologies, including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Translate. Today, Brin continues to work for Google as the president of Google's parent company, Alphabet.The most inspiring about Sergey Brin's story is his determination to pursue his dreams, even when others doubted him. Many people thought his ideas were too radical or impossible to achieve. But Brin didn't give up, and he went on to change the way we use the internet. He also used his success to help others, donating millions of dollars to causes like health and education.

259 - 30 Jan 2024 04:32PM - +263 71 227 4883: Section 5  No, that is not true. There are many factors that contribute to poor diets in Africa, including poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and cultural beliefs about food. While agricultural productivity is one factor, it's not the only one. And in some cases, farming methods may be inefficient not because they're stagnant, but because they're limited by factors like access to technology, water, and fertilizer. So it's not as simple as saying that farms are stagnant and inefficient, and there's a lot more that goes into this issue.  Furthermore, African farmers don't have access to the latest farming technologies, like hybrid seeds, irrigation systems, and fertilizer. Without these technologies, it's difficult to increase agricultural productivity and improve diets. Another challenge is that many farmers in Africa rely on rain-fed agriculture, which can be unreliable and lead to crop failure in times of drought. This is especially problematic in countries like Ethiopia and Somalia, where droughts are common. Finally, cultural beliefs about food can also play a role in poor diets. For example, in some parts of Africa, certain foods like eggs and dairy products are considered to be for children.  Another challenge facing African farmers is the lack of access to markets. In many cases, farmers have to sell their crops to local middlemen, who then sell the crops to urban markets. This means that farmers often don't get a fair price for their crops, and the lack of access to markets can lead to food insecurity. Additionally, farmers may not have access to information about market prices or the best practices for growing their crops. All of these factors can contribute to poor diets in Africa. So it is not as simple as saying that farms are stagnant and inefficient.  Also, Africans have poor diets because they cannot afford nutritious and healthy foods, not because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. The primary cause of hunger in Africa is rural poverty, not food shortages. And policy interventions should focus more on the demand side of the food system, rather than the supply side, to improve the dietary diversity and quality of Africans.  On another research l discovered how some policies, such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), have undermined the crop diversity of African farmers by promoting commercial seeds and fertilizers for starchy crops, such as maize and rice. And now l suggest that what African farmers need most is crop diversity, which improves their diet diversity.  The majority of the hungry in Africa are rural, most living off crops they grow for subsistence and for sale. Even though they can‚Äôt afford expensive commercial seeds and fertilizers, donors have been pushing such inputs across the region.

27 - 29 Jan 2024 02:54PM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

46 - 30 Jan 2024 11:03AM - Harmehak: You're very welcome,  So Mr Gilbert, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
47 - 30 Jan 2024 11:19AM - +263 73 456 6584: Maybe  it's because the degrees ,diplomas and certificates are recognized internationally , and some of the great people and prominent business people have also obtained their education from India
48 - 30 Jan 2024 11:38AM - Harmehak: That's correct!
49 - 30 Jan 2024 11:38AM - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  *1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.  2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education.

72 - 30 Jan 2024 03:05PM - +263 73 456 6584: I was told that it depends with the universities , and where they are located as well as their popularity  , some charge tuition fees ranging from $500-$800/ Simester and accomodation on campus was told is a bit expensive so the better to opt for off campus where it will cost around $50 and food was told is very affordable to as little as $30/ month so for accommodation and food was told if you get something around $1200 /year it will be ok
73 - 30 Jan 2024 03:08PM - Harmehak: Alright!
74 - 30 Jan 2024 03:08PM - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
75 - 30 Jan 2024 03:15PM - +263 73 456 6584: Ok so is very cheap
76 - 30 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
77 - 30 Jan 2024 03:44PM - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

80 - 30 Jan 2024 05:12PM - Harmehak: Indeed;
81 - 30 Jan 2024 05:12PM - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well,  Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*  What are you thoughts on the same please?
82 - 30 Jan 2024 05:38PM - +263 78 362 1370: I think that will be affordable and it's better because it reduces  some costs
83 - 30 Jan 2024 05:43PM - Harmehak: That's great,  Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
84 - 30 Jan 2024 05:43PM - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
206 - 30 Jan 2024 08:10PM - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Mufaro,  Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on ‚Äú31-01-23‚Äù at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.  We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.  If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.  Happy Family Discussion! Stay Blessed!
207 - 30 Jan 2024 08:17PM - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, thank you for the best wishes and counseling in my career guidance
208 - 30 Jan 2024 08:19PM - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
209 - 30 Jan 2024 08:19PM - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

77 - 30 Jan 2024 03:54PM - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  *1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.  2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.  3. *Quality Education and Research:* Indian universities emphasize a rigorous academic curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development. Students have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and collaboration with experts.  4. *Faculty Expertise:* The faculty members in Indian institutions are highly qualified and bring industry expertise to the classroom.

79 - 30 Jan 2024 03:54PM - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
104 - 30 Jan 2024 05:37PM - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
105 - 30 Jan 2024 05:38PM - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
106 - 30 Jan 2024 05:38PM - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
107 - 30 Jan 2024 05:38PM - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
108 - 30 Jan 2024 05:41PM - +263 78 121 6726: This us interesting
109 - 30 Jan 2024 06:13PM - Harmehak: In simple words Takudzwa, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*  However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
110 - 30 Jan 2024 06:14PM - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
111 - 30 Jan 2024 06:14PM - +263 78 121 6726: I will talk to my parents tonight and give you feedback ASAP
112 - 30 Jan 2024 06:15PM - Harmehak: I do understand!
113 - 30 Jan 2024 06:15PM - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.  Did you follow the same too?",No,Yes

40 - 30 Jan 2024 03:55PM - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth. Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles ‚Äì so much for rent, for food, for the children‚Äôs shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can‚Äôt really afford . As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.  1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage a)The cause of poverty is extravagance. b)Stingy habits of the poor. c)Being extravagant is always condemnable. d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.  2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time. b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle. c)Must be extravagant before achieving success. d)Should not bother about popularity.  3. The phrase ‚Äòlavish with his hospitality‚Äô in the third sentence of the first paragraph means a)Extravagance in entertaining guest. b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives. c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers. d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.  4.The word ‚Äòparadox‚Äô in the last sentence of the first paragraph means a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning b)Statement based on facts c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth. d)Statement based on the popular opinion  5.What is the meaning of the word ‚Äúequanimity‚Äù? a)Calmness b)Discomposure c)Equivocal d)Dubious  *_SECTION 3_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* *_Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage.

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. A) NO CHANGE B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production. C) supplement, while sweet whey is more desirable as a food additive for humans.

Therefore , To a lesser extent , many Africans have poor diets  because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.One of the reasons why Africans have poor diets is poor management of farms . In Africa, some regions have rich and fertile soil but they are being poorly managed . Inorder to promote good soil management farmers should practice farming methods like crop rotation, shifting cultivation and mulching.Farms should be distributed to farmers who a willing to work thoroughly o n the farm and they should produce a bumber harvest .  Political instability is also another cause of poor diet and malnutrition in Africa , examples of countries like Somalia are suffering because of political instability,they usually experience wars in their country and the government is not willing to address issues of poverty that causes poor diets in those countries.African governments should elect leaders who are ready to save their  fellow people from hunger and poor living conditions. Every one must get employed inorder to enjoy higher living standards  Economic inequality is also another cause of poor diet in Africa . The government must offer food stuffs to the needy like the orphans , widows and the widowers . The Non Governmental organizations must take part in helping the above mentioned people  hence economic equality is achieved . The wealthy people should also help the poor people.  In addition, climatic change is also a cause of poor diet in Africa.The heavens sometimes give low amount of rainfall .for example here in Zimbabwe, in the Midlands .there has hardly been a down pour .and the sun is burning as hell . To solve the issue of low rainfall , the farmers should use machinery like the irrigation systems .This will be necessary because water for the weeds will be available to water the farm.  Conclusively, there are many causes of poor diet in Africa . They may lead to diseases like kwashiorkor in Children and malnutrition in elderly people.  Therefore , the government should recommend, farming schemes , like ""pfumvudza"" that has been introduced in Zimbabwe, crop rotation, shifting cultivation and mulching.  Section 6  My inspirational story  Life is like a teacher , the more you learn, Sometimes our expectations are not our achievements . Five years back I had seen my self a  successful person by this time but life turned out to be something else .  After passing my ordinary level with flying colors I expected to secure a place for my Advanced level but I failed to get the place for no apparent reason.  The devil had locked the doors of my future all knowing that I was a brilliant student with a bright future ahead of me .  I stayed home at home but I did not lose hope . I decided to right more of my ordinary level subjects though I heard passed already .I wrote 3 more subjects and I passed them .After that the coming year by God's grace I manage to secure a place at a nearby school in my area. I went for my Advanced level but when I was about to right my exams I started to experience sickness which no one understood My parents took me to different hospitals but to no avail. I attempted to right my A levels for Three times but I failed due to sickness  .  One day I got prayed for by a certain woman of God and the illness stopped I wrote my exams and I passed with the required passes . I thank God for that because the phase of agony and pain had passed . For the bible says no weapon formed against me shall prosper.  I would like to share this story with someone who has lost hope that . Keep on thriving God is the answer to all our problems and there is no permanent situation.That is my story .

383 - 30 Jan 2024 03:19PM - Keshav Edoofa: Throughout the session, i have been evaluating Chamaine's response and I have confidence in Chamaine's capabilities Mr. Bervely that she will definitely clear the eligibility check, as from my experience of counseling so many students I do realize which student deserves the scholarship.  As a parent you have a natural concern that I duly understand, However if a student does not clear the eligibility check Mr. Bervely the parent won't be paying anything as the student will not be enrolled in the program, if Chamaine doesn't clear you do not have to pay anything as she would not be admitted into the program, she can apply in the next intake of admissions

16 - 30 Jan 2024 11:23AM - +263 77 594 9676: It‚Äôs a program designed to help and assist students by providing affordable education through scholarships and also offering assistance to foreign students on any issue no matter how small to help them fit into the new environment

25 - 30 Jan 2024 12:08PM - +263 77 412 1368: So how do you rate which student to give scholarship and at such at percentage
26 - 30 Jan 2024 12:09PM - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Also it depends upon your grades, your willingness to join the program to achieve greater things in life etc.
27 - 30 Jan 2024 12:13PM - +263 77 594 9676: Yes that is right

Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?

149 - 30 Jan 2024 12:02PM - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
150 - 30 Jan 2024 12:28PM - +263 71 669 8958: I believe all of the above facts are very significant. I say so because the guidance and stewardship will help me focus on the right goals. The reduction in the fees makes it even more worthwhile. Moreover, the vast knowledge I will acquire from engaging with the EWYL program will propel me to greater heights in my career.
151 - 30 Jan 2024 12:48PM - Kunal: Great! So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability. Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

427 - 30 Jan 2024 09:43PM - +265 999 54 69 90: Subject: Request for Extension of Enrollment Fee Deadline for Chimwemwe Ngaiyaye Majanga  Dear Edoofa Scholarship Program Committee,  I trust this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am reaching out to you as a parent on behalf of my son, Chimwemwe Ngaiyaye Majanga, who has been found eligible to pursue a science in agriculture through your esteemed scholarship program. We are immensely grateful for this opportunity, and we are eager to see him thrive in this academic pursuit.  Regrettably, I must bring to your attention the financial challenges we are currently facing, which are making it exceedingly difficult for us to raise the required funds for the enrollment fee within the specified timeframe. Due to poverty and financial constraints, we find ourselves in a position where meeting this financial obligation has become an insurmountable hurdle.  Understanding the significance of meeting enrollment requirements, I humbly appeal to you to consider extending the closing date for the enrollment fee. This extension would afford us the necessary time to secure the requisite funds and enable Chimwemwe to take full advantage of the life-changing opportunity your scholarship program provides.  As parents, we are deeply committed to providing our son with the best possible education and opportunities for a bright and prosperous future. The Edoofa Scholarship Program is an invaluable beacon of hope for Chimwemwe and many other deserving students who aspire to overcome financial hardships and pursue their educational dreams.  I sincerely hope that you will give thoughtful consideration to our earnest request for an extension of the enrollment fee deadline. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter will not only benefit Chimwemwe but also numerous other students who are in similar circumstances and share the same aspirations for a better future.  We are immensely grateful for the opportunity that the Edoofa Scholarship Program presents, and we remain hopeful that our request will be positively received. Your support and understanding in this matter will make a profound difference in the lives of aspiring students like Chimwemwe.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. We eagerly anticipate a positive response and hope for the opportunity for Chimwemwe to participate in your scholarship program.  Warm regards,  Mrs Ngaiyaye

I am an U6 student at Mt Pleasant School. I‚Äôm a good volleyball player. My strength is my belief in the Almighty. I was born in a family of five (5) exclusive of my mother and father. I‚Äôm the middle child with two of my elder brothers self dependent and my younger brother and sister still in school. I‚Äôm a student interested in Business administration. I believe I want to achieve the masters degree in business administration. My father is currently serving his last year as a police officer in the Ministry of Home Affairs and my mother is not employed. My father is a graduate and on a sad note my mother could not finish up her O‚ÄôLevel. As mentioned earlier, two of my elder brothers are self dependent and are staying on their own with the other one staying with his wife. And the younger ones are in school, the one after me is in form 2 and the last born my sister she is in grade 2. Luckily up until now, my father haas been funding for my education. For my higher education abroad my family will be funding for my education. I also have stubborn faith in getting a scholarship that will help my family to cater for my education financially. I did my O Level at Howard High School and I am currently doing my A Level at Mount Pleasant High and back then our fees at Howard summed up to roughly a total of maybe $600 USD. The school fees at Mount Pleasant High is currently $150 USD.

138 - 30 Jan 2024 10:21AM - Kunal: Noted Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

142 - 30 Jan 2024 10:50AM - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
143 - 30 Jan 2024 10:50AM - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field  *Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* *Physiotherapy* *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology* *Bachelor of Science in Optometry* *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology* etc  Would you like me to explain any of these programs to you?

1 hr 3 mins","245 - 30 Jan 2024 12:37PM - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
246 - 30 Jan 2024 01:00PM - +27 84 416 1241: I haven't done done that since my child has been aiming at international education
247 - 30 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Pallika Edoofa: You see, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
248 - 30 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child‚Äôs career, aren't you?
249 - 30 Jan 2024 01:07PM - +27 84 416 1241: Oh yes you got me right because in Zimbabwe we have graduates who are loitering around without job and for that reason i am aiming for my child to graduate and get a job that's why I see Edoofa Program is a proper fit for her
250 - 30 Jan 2024 01:38PM - Pallika Edoofa: bsolutely, I understand your concern about job opportunities for graduates in Zimbabwe. Ensuring your child's education leads to tangible career prospects is crucial. The Edoofa Program indeed offers a comprehensive pathway for students to acquire the skills and experiences necessary to secure meaningful employment after graduation. It's a fitting choice to help your child achieve their career aspirations.  So, are willing to put in some extra efforts for your child's future?
251 - 30 Jan 2024 01:51PM - +27 84 416 1241: More than willing

255 - 30 Jan 2024 03:30PM - +27 84 416 1241: She is still at school and will only be available in the next two hours. Kindly excuse me for that
256 - 30 Jan 2024 03:30PM - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.  *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Courtly?*",No,Yes

83 - 30 Jan 2024 09:40AM - +263 77 210 1377: Greetings.Yes we can proceed.  Yesterday we had an opportunity to engage Jonathan's A Level teacher and he was of the opinion that Jonathan undertakes a degree in Computer Science purely and then specialize as he goes up the academic ladder.
84 - 30 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
85 - 30 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue with this course?
86 - 30 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +263 77 210 1377: No, not willing to pursue this one but Computer Science
87 - 30 Jan 2024 10:14AM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing the teacher's recommendation. While pursuing a BSc in Computer Science is definitely an option, I'd like to offer an alternative perspective as a counselor. Opting for a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree also holds significant advantages. BCA provides a strong foundation in computer science along with specialized training in practical applications, which can lead to quicker entry into the workforce. Additionally, BCA programs often emphasize industry-relevant skills, offer opportunities for hands-on learning, and provide a pathway to internships for gaining real-world experience.
88 - 30 Jan 2024 10:23AM - +263 77 210 1377: Yes I get what you are saying and appreciate your advice.We may therefore need a little bit of time to research before making a final decision.
89 - 30 Jan 2024 10:27AM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, You can research for the same.
90 - 30 Jan 2024 10:27AM - Pallika Edoofa: Please note Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) over a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSc CS) can offer numerous advantages aligned with one's career aspirations. BCA programs typically provide a more specialized and practical approach to computer science education, focusing on the application of theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios. This emphasis on practical skills equips students with a hands-on understanding of software development, database management, and other key areas crucial in today's tech-driven job market. Additionally, BCA curricula often integrate industry-relevant projects and internships, offering students valuable exposure to the professional landscape and networking opportunities. As such, opting for a BCA degree can be advantageous for individuals seeking a more direct path to fulfilling their career goals in the field of computer science.

95 - 29 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

101 - 30 Jan 2024 10:00AM - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

10 - 30 Jan 2024 09:52AM - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.  *So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
