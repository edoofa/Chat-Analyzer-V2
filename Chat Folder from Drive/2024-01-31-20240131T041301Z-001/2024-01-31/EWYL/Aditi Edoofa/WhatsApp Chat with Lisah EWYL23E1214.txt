30/1/24, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263778203688 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 820 3688: I want to work in government or policy, helping to create laws and policies that benefit the people of my country.  I have a strong sense of civic duty and a desire to serve the public.
30/1/24, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations with me. It's truly commendable that you have a strong sense of civic duty and a desire to contribute to the well-being of your country by working in government or policy.

Your goal of helping to create laws and policies that benefit the people reflects a noble commitment to public service. Working in this field allows individuals to make a meaningful impact on society and contribute to positive change.

The Earn While You Learn program can be a valuable step toward achieving your career objectives. By providing financial support and opportunities for practical experience, it aligns well with your goals.
30/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Oky
30/1/24, 9:20 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 820 3688: No can you please help
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you for understanding
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 9:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I have to say it's been a delightful exchange! Excitedly looking forward to our next session. 🌟😊
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 77 820 3688: Thank you
