No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 1:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted with caution
23/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Thank you for this welcoming message . I will be glad to work with you as well

23/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Currently she is not available
As she is at work. But I will notify her of your presence
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
23/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So now, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Beyond all that the EWYL program offers. I had desires to
be a CEO of back-end website developer company involved in selling new technological advancement devices. So EWYL program would set a foundation for me to create my own opportunities and maybe help me to be a decision maker
23/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your ambition to become a CEO in the field of back-end website development and new technological devices. The EWYL program indeed seems like a stepping stone to lay the foundation for your aspirations, providing valuable skills and experiences.
23/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 274 4769: I am digesting it deeper
23/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great! <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Well you can brief me on that
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted 1st point
23/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Noted 2nd point
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Great to know you all
I hope to work with you well
23/1/24, 2:23 PM - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Great news
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Yes indeed
23/1/24, 2:27 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 274 4769: The EWYL document summarizes the necessary skills needed for me to tackle the 21st century job opportunity. To be able to recognize these skills , I must be aware and be able to acquire the skills based on the technological advancements . It clarifies that there are enduring skills which can't be replaced by computers like: decision making ,empathy networking and many others. The EWYL program helps to reduce the financial burden to my family and myself as an individual.

 Cooperate Alliances

30/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 274 4769: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *Offline Application Form*

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
30/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
30/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 274 4769: Okay noted
30/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*CARLOS/ADITI*
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
30/1/24, 2:06 PM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
