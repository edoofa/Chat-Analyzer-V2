30/1/24, 8:42 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh we Can't do it without them today coz they are currently busy
Can we go on today and they will join tomorrow
30/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure, I understand!
30/1/24, 8:46 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 8:52 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: I want to become a very successful economist not only in my country but even outside where i want big companies or organisations to trust me and depend on me in different areas like decision making even more

So the EWYL program i strongly believe that it will help me to achieve them because those credits that i will be receiving will lessen the burden that my parents have to bear in paying school fees,atleast part of the remaing fees will be covered through this program making me go further with my education and dreams
30/1/24, 8:55 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations and goals with me. It's commendable that you have a clear vision of becoming a successful economist and contributing not only to your country but globally. The ambition to earn the trust of big companies and organizations showcases your determination.

I'm glad to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable opportunity to support your educational journey. The financial assistance provided through the program will indeed alleviate the burden on your parents and contribute to fulfilling your dreams.
30/1/24, 8:57 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Thank you so much
30/1/24, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: No please you can remind me so we can be on the same pace
30/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure,  let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 9:01 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 9:03 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Yes yes,i understand now
30/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
30/1/24, 9:06 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay,it will be nice to interact with both of them
30/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
30/1/24, 9:08 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 9:09 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Very interesting ma'am
30/1/24, 9:14 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/1/24, 9:19 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Sure we can proceed now
30/1/24, 9:23 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

30/1/24, 9:25 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: Oh okay okay let me go through them,am excited already about this
30/1/24, 9:27 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +265 888 03 87 59: This is interesting,it needs more time to understand everything and upon looking at it,if the person is reading and following this,am sure they will become better person...i quote what Mr angad has said in newsletter 2 that "Not everything is simple. The best things in life demand some work". Am looking forward to read more of these
Thanks for sharing,i will read them again in the evening to grab more
30/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I have to say it's been a delightful exchange! Excitedly looking forward to our next session. 🌟😊
