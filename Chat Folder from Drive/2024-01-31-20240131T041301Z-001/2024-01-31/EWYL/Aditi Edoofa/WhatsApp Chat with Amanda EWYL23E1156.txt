30/1/24, 2:09 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Amanda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 673 5858: I plan on working for a tech company in helping the development and upgrading of AI in the hopes of building a better tomorrow through technological advancement

30/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Thank you
30/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 673 5858: No I do not
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 2:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I have to say it's been a delightful exchange! Excitedly looking forward to our next session. 🌟😊
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Same as me
30/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 673 5858: Thank you
