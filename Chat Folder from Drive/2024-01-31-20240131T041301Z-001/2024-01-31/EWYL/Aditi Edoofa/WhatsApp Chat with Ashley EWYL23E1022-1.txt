How are you doing today?
23/1/24, 1:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon on this beautiful day!✨
I am well. Hope you are well.

Let's begin with today's discussion🚀
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes of course
23/1/24, 1:51 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
23/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes of course, that it my mother Miss Maiden James . She is currently doing a diploma in education and has given birth to 3 children .
23/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing. It's wonderful to hear about your mother's pursuits in education and her family. I extend a warm welcome to her for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you Ms. Aditi
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I mentioned on the statement of purpose that my long term goal is to obtain a degree in Accounting and finance and l think the Edoofa Scholarship Program is going to help me a lot through this phrase as it would be giving me an opportunity to get higher education in India unlike here in Zimbabwe education is very poor and expenses are really hard
23/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations. Pursuing a degree in Accounting and Finance is a commendable goal, and it's great that you see the Edoofa Scholarship Program as a valuable opportunity.
23/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Please explain a bit about the two objectives.
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 2:10 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Understood Ms. Aditi.
23/1/24, 2:14 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Noted
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Very interesting.
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

24/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes l noticed it and it would be really nice to be noticed by the founder himself.
24/1/24, 2:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed. <This message was edited>
