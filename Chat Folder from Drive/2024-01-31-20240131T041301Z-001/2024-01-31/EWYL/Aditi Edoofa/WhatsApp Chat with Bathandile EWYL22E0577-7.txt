6/1/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Bathandile

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 77 373 6612: Greetings Ms Aditi. Thank you for sharing this information with me. I truly understand, l wish them Good luck with their presentations. Its not an easy task to present , it alot of confidence.  We will meet on the 11th of January. Take care🙏
11/1/24, 4:22 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

" Yes l have completed my high school, l passed my A' level, l don't know what to do next, alot is going on in my mind. My wish is to complete my education abroad. I don't want to go to UZ their education can't be a match with the education abroad. What can l do.


The second speaker is going to say, 

Ohhh hie , sorry l overheard you talking about going abroad and stuff. You shouldn't worry , there is this scholarship called Edoofa scholarship it is the best, have you ever heard about it?
