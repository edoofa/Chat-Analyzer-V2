If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine..
I guess it may start by asking my name 😃😃😃
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's true, the foundation of a wonderful pet-owner relationship might just begin with a simple question, like asking your name. <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 585 4209: okey

3/1/24, 2:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Briefly, its about learning more about the industry which I'm going to enter after the studies as well as connecting with some of the subordinates like human and resource managers ,
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Albert. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you on Friday from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.*
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Okey well noted .

I hope you are doing well. Unfortunately, you weren't able to attend the session today. Kindly share the reason for missing the session. 

Exciting news awaits! We are
orchestrating a spectacular industrial visit - *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 from Monday to Wednesday. Picture this: our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities, are immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈. Bracing themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The ambiance will be electric, with performances, quizzes, and mind-blowing games⚡ 
*Stay tuned for updates and pictures on Thursday from 1:30-3:30 PM, capturing the essence of this extraordinary experience.*
7/1/24, 6:46 AM - +263 78 585 4209: Good morning Ms Jasmine.  Today I might be not available for the session.  I will be busy at work today . I greatly apologise for that .
15/1/24, 1:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon Albert_*
Kindly excuse me for the delay in my response. Following the event, I experienced a fever and had to be on bed rest for a couple of days.

Let me share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

18/1/24, 12:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon*_
I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 12:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The mentorship team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾
29/1/24, 9:14 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good Morning Albert*,
I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinator for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have *the golden opportunity to collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh*, and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
29/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity *today at 2:30 PM CAT.* If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call. 🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨
29/1/24, 9:15 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Albert,
As discussed please join this link for your training call:
http://meet.google.com/ozt-bsay-pdy
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Hello, Albert!
I hope you are doing well. I understand you were unable to join the call yesterday due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!
30/1/24, 8:24 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Good evening
