Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.

15/1/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 854 7550: Am good how are you
15/1/24, 12:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
15/1/24, 12:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
15/1/24, 12:49 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
15/1/24, 12:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/1/24, 12:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I'm [Your Name], grateful for the Edoofa Scholarship taking me to study in India. With high tuition fees in Zimbabwe, this opportunity is a dream come true.
Back in Zimbabwe, internet costs were steep—around $500 annually. In India, it's just $40 a year, showing how much they value education.
In Zimbabwe, limited seats and job struggles after graduation were concerns. Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program eased these worries, offering $50 to $100 monthly.
Following the 5S principles helped me secure this scholarship. I encourage you to do the same. Counselors will ask questions based on the flyer attached.
Best of luck! Your dreams are closer than you think.

25/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 77 319 4371: How are you here??
27/1/24, 8:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 77 854 7550: Thank you for the support and guidance , l really appreciate you and all the effort that you put into making my journey so far enjoyable and smooth . l wish you the best in all that you are going to do and l wish more enjoyable sessions with your future students.
Please enjoy the rest of your night😊
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - +263 77 312 5117: Thank you Saloni for the journey covered so far with your assistance, we are very grateful for your mentorship, you are such a great leader. Wishing you grace in your new assignments & hoping that our new mentor will pick up from where you left & offer help to our daughter until she finally complete all the processes necessary. Blessings.
27/1/24, 9:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Your message has left me profoundly touched and emotional. To say you've been my best student is an understatement; your attention to detail, active participation, and remarkable growth have enriched our journey beyond measure. Your kind words are some of the most heartwarming parting messages a mentor could receive. I genuinely love you, and I'm immensely grateful for the privilege of being a part of your journey🥺🙌🏼🫶🏻
27/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 77 854 7550: I am really grateful to have been one of best students and I wish you the best in everything that you do and you are genuinely loved as well
28/1/24, 2:50 AM - +263 77 319 4371: I also want to wish you the best in your new venture. Also hope that there will be smooth change of hands for our our daughter, Praise.

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐
