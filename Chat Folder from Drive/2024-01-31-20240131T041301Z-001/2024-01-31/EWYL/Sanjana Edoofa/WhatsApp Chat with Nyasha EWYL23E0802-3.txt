29/12/23, 4:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

How are you?

This week we will be having our session on *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Project updates
Since we don’t have the Saturday activity to be discussed for our session today, I want you to come with any concerns you have to work on the Community Building project and the African School project in our session today. I want us to start accelerating our performance so that we can utilize the time to give our utmost on working on the projects.

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.
16/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 085 1156: Morning ma'am how are you
16/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 78 085 1156: Noted
27/1/24, 8:09 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:09 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:12 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Good evening ma'am thank you for everything and I am going to miss you alot

29/1/24, 2:24 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nyasha,
I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Saloni. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa
29/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 085 1156: I truly appreciate your care and I can not wait to hear the new update from you thank you
29/1/24, 3:26 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good afternoon Leiann,*
I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinators for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯

I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨
30/1/24, 9:16 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good Morning Nyasha,*

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to personally reach out to you today because, I have been studying your progress in the EWYL Community Building Project and seeing that you shared 5 referrals this month it's clear that you're putting in a lot of effort. Kudos to you for that!

Now, till the time you are not assigned with a new mentor, I personally wanted to make sure that your growth and learning journey have not hit a pause and you are able to earn the Scholarship credits that I understand hold a great value in your journey. So today, I'm stepping in to assist you. If you're facing any challenges in your projects or if there are concerns you'd like to address, feel free to share them with me. Your success is our priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Remember your progress and development are our top priorities. Let's continue this journey together, and I'm here if you require any assistance or guidance. Keep up the spirit and hard work, we are really proud of you!
30/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 085 1156: Good morning
30/1/24, 9:24 AM - +263 78 085 1156: Thank you very much
30/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: I hope you are having a lovely morning Nyasha, and if not so get ready to create one! I have especially created a voice message to share my energy and excitement with you regarding your selection as one of our event coordinators. As discussed yesterday, I have also shared the timings with you so, go ahead and listen to the audio carefully!🚀⭐
30/1/24, 10:13 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 085 1156: Thank you very much ma'am I am so excited
30/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha
As discussed, I look forward to seeing you in the meeting at 2:30 pm CAT. KIndly ensure you join on time.

30/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Good afternoon ma'am sorry  I won't be able to join the meeting due to network problems can you please reschedule it for tomorrow
30/1/24, 3:25 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Nyasha, I hope you shall be able to attend future sessions, since a lot was covered in today's meeting.
30/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Yes I will
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Can you please share what I missed from today's meeting
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: I understand you were unable to join the call today due to certain challenges. However, since you have shown enthusiasm for this role and for our event, I thought I'd personally reach out to you and bring you upto speed about the discussion I had yesterday with all the students who have been chosen to become a coordinator along with you. Together, you and your co-Edoofians shall be managing an event that would have a footfall of around *5000 participants*. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest events you ever attend in your academic or professional life. This is the first time that an event of such scale is being conducted in Zimbabwe. In fact, you'd be surprised to know that we had to really struggle to find a suitable venue for such a big event in all of Harare. 

Now, while I know that it is challenging for you to attend each training session, I would not want you to miss out on the oppurtunity of being a part of this mega event, so please do try and participate in as many training calls and sessions in the upcoming days as you can- there will be a lot to learn!! I look forward to seeing you soon!
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 085 1156: Thank you very much
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 085 1156: I will surely try to attend all the session
