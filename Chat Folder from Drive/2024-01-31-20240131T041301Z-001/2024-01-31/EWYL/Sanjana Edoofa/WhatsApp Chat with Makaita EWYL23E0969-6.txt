How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

Hope you are doing well.

I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your husband's brother. Please accept my deepest condolences during this difficult time. Your decision to spend time with family in your rural home is entirely understandable, and it's important to prioritize your well-being and support each other.

Take all the time you need, and do not worry about online commitments. Family comes first, and I hope that being together will provide comfort and strength during this period of grief. If there's anything I can do to support or assist you upon your return, please feel free to let me know.

How are you?

I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days.

27/1/24, 7:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 78 871 0042: Thank you ma'am for the words of hope and this boosts mi optimism for a brighter future ahead... But ma'am,can I still contact you whenever I have a question,I will miss you though🥺
27/1/24, 8:58 PM - +263 77 294 9349: Thank you ma'am for the support you our daughter and we will continue to cherish it.Best wishes in your new endeavors.
27/1/24, 9:13 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Your message has left me profoundly touched and emotional. To say you've been my best student is an understatement; your attention to detail, active participation, and remarkable growth have enriched our journey beyond measure. Your kind words are some of the most heartwarming parting messages a mentor could receive. I genuinely love you, and I'm immensely grateful for the privilege of being a part of your journey🥺🙌🏼🫶🏻
29/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Makaita,
I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Saloni. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa

Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨
