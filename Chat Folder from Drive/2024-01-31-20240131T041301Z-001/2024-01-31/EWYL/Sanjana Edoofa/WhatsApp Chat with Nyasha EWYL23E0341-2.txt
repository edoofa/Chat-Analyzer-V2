6/1/24, 1:53 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Nyasha
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
16/1/24, 8:13 AM - +263 71 655 3182: Mam how are you
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Nyasha
I am doing absolutely alright, thank you so much for asking.
16/1/24, 11:52 PM - +263 71 655 3182: Very nice mam it's my pleasure
27/1/24, 8:16 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings of the day, Nyasha*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.
27/1/24, 8:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

Thank you for being an integral part of my life's journey. Keep radiating brilliance, dare to dream ambitiously, and always remember the remarkable potential within you. 
*I want to assure you that the mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
27/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 71 655 3182: Am doing well Mam and I really thank you for all the effort, time and services you rendered myself but it is bitter for me as well and maybe it will come to meet soon and we will flock together      May the Lord continue to bless you thank you
29/1/24, 11:21 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nyasha,

I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Sharda. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa

30/1/24, 9:05 PM - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam? It's nice to meet you and am doing very well. Yeah I do appreciate your support for me but the real thing is am sorry I've withdrawn from the scholarship due to some reasons here and I had told Mrs Sharda about the issue and if I happen to apply again I will Mam. Am sorry maybe I had wasted your time somehow but I just want to be open with you
