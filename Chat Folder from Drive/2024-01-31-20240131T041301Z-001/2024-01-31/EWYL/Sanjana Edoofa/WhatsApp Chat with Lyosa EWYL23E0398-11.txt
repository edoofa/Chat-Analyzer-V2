I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I want to share some heartfelt news with you. After careful consideration, I've come to a decision that carries a mix of emotions. *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor.*

As we journey through this moment, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions realizing that our daily interactions are about to change. *Saying goodbye to our current way of connecting brings a bittersweet feeling*, but deep down, I see change as a chance for growth and the discovery of new opportunities.

Reflecting on our shared journey, I am truly humbled by the extraordinary moments we've experienced together—the bonds we've forged, the shared laughter, and the countless instances of mutual growth and learning.

Our daily interactions have been invaluable, and the memories we've created will stay with me. I believe in the power of change for growth, and I'm eager to embrace this new chapter.

I want to express my deepest gratitude for being an inspiring mentor. Your wisdom and encouragement have been instrumental in my development. As I embark on this educational journey, I carry with me the lessons learned under your guidance.
