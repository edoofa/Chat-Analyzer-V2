15/1/24, 12:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
15/1/24, 12:28 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

25/1/24, 10:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Tapiwanashe!
How are you?
25/1/24, 10:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
25/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 78 602 0609: I'm blessed and yourself saloni maam
25/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 78 602 0609: @918002312433 l need your help maam
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:46 PM - +263 78 602 0609: It's not going to be easy letting you go as my mentor maam 
From you l have learned a lot educationally and emotionally qnd adjusting to a new mentor is not something l expected l would come across
27/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 602 0609: But since you have decided a root in life which enables you to enhance your life then maybe it is worth letting go of us 
And we also wish you a lovely journey jn your higher education maam 

Thank you maam @918002312433 
You have been more of a guardian to me than just a mentor
27/1/24, 8:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Your message has left me profoundly touched and emotional. To say you've been my best student is an understatement; your attention to detail, active participation, and remarkable growth have enriched our journey beyond measure. Your kind words are some of the most heartwarming parting messages a mentor could receive. I genuinely love you, and I'm immensely grateful for the privilege of being a part of your journey🫶🏻
29/1/24, 2:25 PM - Sanjana Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tapiwanashe,
I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Saloni. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth. While we are actively searching for a new mentor to guide you further, I have taken up the responsibility of being available to you in case of any queries or assistance required.

Moving forward, I have a very exciting new update to share with you, which would be a big milestone for you on your personal journey with Edoofa
29/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 602 0609: I'm glad to have you as my mebote for the mean time maam

I am thrilled to share some incredible news with you - after careful consideration and discussions about your performance in the EWYL Program, you have been selected to take on *the role of Event Coordinators for Edoofa's upcoming Meet & Greet in Zimbabwe* that is due in a few days! Congratulations on this well-deserved opportunity!🥳

This is no ordinary event; _we are expecting a gathering of 5000 people_, and we believe in your ability to not just meet but exceed the responsibilities that come with this role. ⭐

This role is not mandatory but rather an invitation for you to explore and consider. As one of the Event Coordinators, it's a chance for you to showcase your *leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity* on a grand scale. Apart from this, you will also have the golden opportunity to *collaborate with Edoofa’s Team, work closely with Mr. Angad Singh,* and contribute significantly to the success of this huge event! 🎯
I know you must be feeling butterflies in your stomach, along with a lot of questions in your mind. Well, to clear all your doubts regarding this opportunity we have scheduled *a video call with all the students who have been given this opportunity tomorrow* and the timings for the same will be also shared tomorrow itself. If you have any questions or if there's anything you'd like to discuss, please note it down so that it can be addressed over the call.🚨

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨
