23/12/23, 3:00 PM - +91 75269 32812: Thank you mam
23/12/23, 4:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Edgar,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:14 PM - +91 75269 32812: Sorry mam was occupied recently
27/12/23, 4:14 PM - +91 75269 32812: How are you

28/12/23, 2:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:11 PM - +91 75269 32812: It was because of the holiday mam, from now own i will give you all my update
29/12/23, 10:14 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Edgar,
How are you?
29/12/23, 10:15 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I can understand that and I hope you will work in full power from new year onwards.
29/12/23, 11:11 AM - +91 75269 32812: Im positive mam i will start sharing forms from 2 January onwards. New year new goals
29/12/23, 11:11 AM - +91 75269 32812: I also need that form layout to share with students and resources about edoofa
29/12/23, 11:11 AM - +91 75269 32812: I lost some in my old phone
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is an advance wish since along with you, our organization will be occupied in New Year celebrations from tomorrow till 1st January, Monday, so I will share your session schedule post that.

I pray for your good health, wealth, and success, and yes,

_*see you next year👋🏼*_

25/1/24, 12:41 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Edgar
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
25/1/24, 12:43 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I have noted all this, thank you so much🌟
25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Department of Student DSW) team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
25/1/24, 12:59 PM - +91 75269 32812: Ok mam, thank you. I really enjoyed our time together.
30/1/24, 9:16 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: *Good Morning Edgar,*

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to personally reach out to you today because, I have been studying your progress in the EWYL Community Building Project and seeing that you shared 5 referrals this month it's clear that you're putting in a lot of effort. Kudos to you for that!

Now, till the time you are not assigned with a new mentor, I personally wanted to make sure that your growth and learning journey have not hit a pause and you are able to earn the Scholarship credits that I understand hold a great value in your journey. So today, I'm stepping in to assist you. If you're facing any challenges in your projects or if there are concerns you'd like to address, feel free to share them with me. Your success is our priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

Remember your progress and development are our top priorities. Let's continue this journey together, and I'm here if you require any assistance or guidance. Keep up the spirit and hard work, we are really proud of you!
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - +91 75269 32812: Ok mam i wanted to know more about my scholarship grant
30/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: Edgar, you may connect with your DSW Officer for any queries realted to the Grant. Do feel free to reach out to me for questions related to your projects.
30/1/24, 10:16 AM - +91 75269 32812: Ok
