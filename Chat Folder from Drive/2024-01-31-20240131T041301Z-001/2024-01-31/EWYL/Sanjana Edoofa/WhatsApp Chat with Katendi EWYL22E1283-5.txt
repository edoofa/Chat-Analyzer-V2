📌 Important Note: *Dress Code - Formals* 

*Mark your calendars for the event: January 10th, '24!* 🗓

6/1/24, 12:59 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon*_ @260966813038 @260977518729 
If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - +260 96 6813038: Good day. We have been following the conversations and your good work in preparing Katendi mentally. 

Personally,  I feel this a great opportunity ( thanks to Edoofa) as it will be a platform for Katendi to experience real life  and practical situations away from the classroom.  This will give her an insight of how the industry works and learn from great leaders on what drives them. Katendi needs to grasp the opportunity and learn as this is a preparation for her future success.

 As David McNally put it: Even eagles need a push. We need to learn to soar in a fast changing world and learning from those that have done it before us, does it. 

Thank you so much for this opportunity.
6/1/24, 4:45 PM - +260 97 7518729: Afternoon, yes we are aware and have been keenly following. It's a great opportunity for her to gain exposure to the diverse cultures out there, meet and interact with the industry professionals, network with peers and start envisioning herself on the professional globe, it starts somewhere and we are grateful for the opportunity. Thank you so much Edoofa.
6/1/24, 9:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am really happy to know this and I really appreciate your participation in Katendis EWYL journey
Goodnight!
7/1/24, 4:41 PM - +260 95 7285931: Good evening Ms.Jasmine

18/1/24, 9:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Katendi*_
I trust this message finds you well and that your day has been delightful thus far. 
I hope you recall the times when I encouraged you to pursue your dreams passionately and put in the hard work to see them come to fruition. 🎓

*Today, with a heavy heart yet fortified by courage, I am sharing with you my decision to step back from my role as your mentor.* It is not without sincere consideration, and I want you to know that your growth and success have always been my utmost priority.

You know, my dream has always been to embark on a journey of higher studies, aiming to obtain a PhD in chemistry from abroad. *While this means I must bid farewell as your mentor, Believe me, I am doing so with the conviction that the next individual stepping into this role will be of equal or even greater caliber. I trust they will guide you with the same dedication, enabling you to achieve your dreams.*
18/1/24, 9:43 AM - Jasmine Edoofa: I have no doubt that you will continue to make me proud, fostering a bond with your new mentor built on honesty and commitment. 

*The DSW team will be in touch with you to discuss the plan going forward.*

As I pen down this closing message, my heart is filled with gratitude for the journey we've shared. I am confident that the next chapter with your new mentor will be marked by growth, support, and achievements that surpass even our fondest expectations. ❤️

Wishing you all the best on your continued journey, and I look forward to hearing about your future successes.🫱🏼‍🫲🏾

I sincerely appreciate the time and dedication you ve poured into helping Katendi pursue her dreams.  Your influence will be invaluable, and I truly that your positive impact will be felt in the future. 

As you move forward,  I wish you nothing but continued success and fulfillment in all your endeavors.  Am already feeling a twinge of separation anxiety on Katendiz behalf. Thank you for everything, and may your path be filled with prosperity and joy. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 2:16 PM - +260 95 7285931: Good Afternoon Ms. Jasmine.........Hope you are okay.
I am sad that you have to go.......I didn't even get to see you again during the Slicon 24 ( I hope you are now feeling better).
You have been a role model to me, you have  pushed me to be the best of myself even in times I thought I wouldn't do something. I'd like to express my  gratitude for your guidance and support throughout our journey.
While I'm excited for the incredible experience that awaits you, I can't help but feel a sense of loss as we bid farewell.Your presence will forever be remembered, I'll miss you so much. 
I wish you all the best on your next journey....May your path be filled with nothing but success.

I trust this message finds you well. Today, I want to take a moment to celebrate the exceptional bond that has been fostered between you and your former mentor, Ms. Jasmine. We truly appreciate the positive impact she has had on your journey with us.

As the Head of the Department, I want to assure you that it is our top priority to ensure a smooth transition for you and to maintain the momentum of your learning and growth.

24/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sanjana Edoofa: _*Wednesday Lesson*_

In today's Wednesday lesson, we'll delve into the impactful realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer technology in the context of saving lives. We'll explore how innovative solutions are leveraging these technologies to make a significant difference in healthcare.

Furthermore, we'll discuss a noteworthy case study involving a startup from Zambia that has effectively translated the concept of using AI and computer technology into practical applications for improving healthcare outcomes. I encourage you to read the provided PDF carefully, as it promises to open your mind to multiple opportunities within this dynamic field.

This lesson aims not only to broaden your understanding of the transformative potential of technology in healthcare but also to inspire you to explore ways you can contribute within your capacities. Feel free to come prepared with questions and ideas for a lively and engaging discussion.

Best regards,

May I submit any student forms here?
24/1/24, 11:39 AM - +260 95 7285931: Received ,Thank you .
30/1/24, 9:49 AM - +260 95 7285931: Wednesday wisdom 
AI in the health sector offers benefits such as improved diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and efficient healthcare management. In the context of a seizure assistant startup in Zambia( which is something I have only come to learn about, and is very interesting), it could enhance early detection, provide real-time monitoring, and offer valuable insights into managing seizures, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy which is a benefit to the health sector not only in Zambia but also world wide.
