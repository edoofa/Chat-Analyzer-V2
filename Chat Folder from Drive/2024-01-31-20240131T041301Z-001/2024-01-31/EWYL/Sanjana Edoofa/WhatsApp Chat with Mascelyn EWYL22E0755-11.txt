26/12/23, 9:33 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Yes l did
26/12/23, 9:34 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Mascelyn, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Mascelyn!

26/12/23, 9:47 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I never received any confirmation after security verification to show that l have created a LinkedIn account
26/12/23, 9:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you try redoing it by 'forget password'?
26/12/23, 9:49 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay let me
26/12/23, 9:51 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will try this after our session ends.
26/12/23, 9:52 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know Mascelyn, if you got a chance to listen to this audio?
26/12/23, 9:53 AM - +263 77 636 4787: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 9:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you try the entire process from another email id?
26/12/23, 9:57 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I have listened to the audio

27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Were you able to do this?
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 77 636 4787: No i didn't
27/12/23, 9:11 AM - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, you can do that later.
27/12/23, 9:11 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have learned from the audio?
27/12/23, 9:18 AM - +263 77 636 4787: This project is mainly about reaching to my other students out there who who want an opportunity to persue their dreams and become part of the EDOOFA community. Of course there will a lot of convincing from me to these people
27/12/23, 9:21 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Mascelyn, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
27/12/23, 9:21 AM - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

27/12/23, 9:24 AM - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/12/23, 9:30 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Ooow that's great🥰
27/12/23, 9:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 9:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Mascelyn/Saloni/27DEC2023*
27/12/23, 9:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/12/23, 9:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/12/23, 9:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/12/23, 9:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/12/23, 9:40 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am
27/12/23, 9:42 AM - +263 77 636 4787: So if there is already an EDOOFA student doing this at my school, l will have to look for other schools then?
27/12/23, 9:47 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You are already a part of that group?
27/12/23, 9:49 AM - +263 77 636 4787: No I'm not
27/12/23, 9:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:58 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am
27/12/23, 10:00 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Mascelyn,
How are you?

Are you excited about today's session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
28/12/23, 9:07 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Yes ma'am 🔥🔥
28/12/23, 9:12 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Were you able to connect with the admin of the group?
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 77 636 4787: No l figured out that the group is not even functioning well
28/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 77 636 4787: And l feel like if l start running the group it will be more like stealing because this person went through a lot just to have people as one so that they can listen to him and enrol them with EDOOFA
28/12/23, 9:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Do listen to this audio
28/12/23, 9:32 AM - +263 77 636 4787: By also including form 5 and those who have already finished school that was very thought of you atleast now there will be more students to reach out to
28/12/23, 9:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed!
28/12/23, 9:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood it well now?
28/12/23, 9:34 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Yes l have
28/12/23, 9:36 AM - +263 77 636 4787: So ma'am firstly l have to talk to these people about my journey with EDOOFA then after they have agreed to be a part of us  then that's when l will add you into the group?
28/12/23, 9:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:38 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 9:39 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood everything and are you ready to learn some tricks and information about Edoofa?
28/12/23, 9:47 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Yes ma'am 🔥
28/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/12/23, 9:50 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:56 AM - +263 77 636 4787: This is detailed
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed!
28/12/23, 10:00 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

4/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I have been trying to reach out to other schools' headboys and headgirls in my community but  it seems like it requires a lot of patience
4/1/24, 11:02 AM - Saloni Edoofa: We will conclude the session for today, I am sure to meet you tomorrow from *10:00-11:00 AM* in the EWYL Group for the upcoming exciting session🫶🏻

5/1/24, 10:27 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I think it's a network problem because l only saw your message 2 minutes ago. On top of it there is a power failure this side
5/1/24, 10:39 AM - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I can understand now.
5/1/24, 10:40 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am
5/1/24, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what challenge did you exactly face that time?
5/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Ma'am it seems like at almost every school there is an Edoofian agent so the acceptance is very uneasy, the moment you mention that you are from EDOOFA they are quick to turn down your offer 😔
5/1/24, 10:52 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Mascelyn, before anything, we need to understand that we are no agents. At Edoofa, we believe all our students are our Student Ambassadors/Student Leaders. We do not believe in transactional relationships with our students but a bond we nurture for a lifetime.
5/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Okay ma'am

12/1/24, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: But how will you communicate with them?
12/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I will create one after receiving a green light from my teachers
12/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 636 4787: Unless you want me to create a group where there will be two participants you and l, whilst we are waiting for the others
12/1/24, 10:23 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I can understand that.
12/1/24, 10:23 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

2.Greetings of the day to you . I am Mascelyn T Chimatira from EDOOFA. I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to a life changing opportunity for students at your school.An opportunity to persue their dreams by studying abroad. 
3.Midlands Province
18/1/24, 10:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
18/1/24, 11:01 AM - Saloni Edoofa: We will resume our discussion tomorrow in our session from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group. I am sure you will be available at that time🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

19/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 636 4787: No ma'am l don't have but l am asking other school heads numbers from my peers
19/1/24, 10:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: What other methods are you trying?
19/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I have tried to reach out to some school administrators(through my church members who work there) so that they can can organise a meeting between me and the school head
19/1/24, 10:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, I am glad to see these efforts💪🏼
19/1/24, 10:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'd like to share the success story of our star performer from last week, Loice. She successfully identified and reached out to three potential schools to meet her targets. Interestingly, she utilized Google for her research. Loice performed searches like 'School nearby,' 'School in Harare,' and 'School in Manicaland,' generating valuable results. Remarkably, she achieved this without physically visiting the schools. Using Google, she gathered essential information, including contact details, and then initiated communication with them via WhatsApp.
19/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 77 636 4787: This is motivational
19/1/24, 10:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: What do you think of this method?
19/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 77 636 4787: I think the method used good compared to the one of reaching out to the peers  atleast we will be having a bigger platform with more schools. But the peer method on the other hand is good because your peers can give a better recommendation of you to their school heads therefore ensuring smooth flow and also they can act as an enzyme in speeding up the communication between us(the school head and l)
19/1/24, 10:57 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true!
19/1/24, 10:58 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let me also share some crucial information that you can share with the headmasters.

27/1/24, 8:01 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 8:01 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 8:13 PM - +263 77 636 4787: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭It's hard to say goodbye to the person that you had created a special bond with. To me you were more of a friend than a mentor. I enjoyed our sessions very much. Hopefully we will be able to meet in the future only if God wills 🙏🏾. I wish you all the best on your new  journey to success 🪜. Go out there to the world and prove the saying that, *"What men  can do, women can do better"* 😁
27/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 77 503 7285: I was following everything, you were a very good mentor.You were do patient.Anywhere  I wish you the best Ms Saloni in you new educational career

Congratulations once again, and let's make this event an unforgettable experience for everyone involved!💯✨
