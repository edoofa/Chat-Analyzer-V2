23/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! Your background growing up in rural Manicaland Province is interesting. It sounds like life was centered around subsistence farming for your family. Kudos on making some extra cash from selling produce! And football as a favorite hobby from primary level? That's awesome! As you grow, aiming to be a town planner is a great goal. Best of luck on that journey! Feel free to share more about your experiences and aspirations.
23/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Yes mam l am ready
24/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam thank you
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 115 4509: No mam l don't know them
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 115 4509: 👍
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam noted
24/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Oky mam
24/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Well noted
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Lm finished now mam
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 115 4509: 🤣🤣 oky mam thank you have a good day you too
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Afternoon mam how are you
25/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Very impressive mam thank you
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Nyasha?
25/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 115 4509: Very brilliant mam
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
25/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

25/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 78 115 4509: On this understand that when l look for company search, l should search for a potential company that could be able to collaborate with Edoofa and that company should be willing to help students that has been enrolled by Edoofa .l should also need to know the nature of that company. That company should be financially sound and also it should know the background of the founder of that company and also to know about the platform that could be used by that company
29/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nyasha!

Let us begin our session as I  wanted to quickly share how we celebrated Republic Day this year!
