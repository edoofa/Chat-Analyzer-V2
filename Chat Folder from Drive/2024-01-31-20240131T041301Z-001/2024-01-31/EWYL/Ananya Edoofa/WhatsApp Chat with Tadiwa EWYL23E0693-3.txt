23/12/23, 12:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tadiwa!

I hope you are doing well. Please excuse my delay in connecting with you earlier. I trust you understand that, due to a high volume of applications, our counselor requires 15-20 days to connect with each student. This time is necessary for a thorough understanding of the application form. During this period, I recommend that you maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.

Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
29/12/23, 9:40 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tadiwa!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?
29/12/23, 3:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_New Year is here!🌟_*

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

7/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
12/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 71 463 5856: Hello Ms Ananya Iam waiting for you on the EWYL Line....
16/1/24, 9:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tadiwa

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!

23/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Tadiwa, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 71 463 5856: Ok sure

I hope you are doing fine. As mentioned earlier, I will soon share a different updated time table with you. We do not have our session today.
26/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I have some exciting news to share with you. Today, we are celebrating Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀
