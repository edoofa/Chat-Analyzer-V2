Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM

Let me know which one suits your schedule best.
20/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I am ready ma'am.
20/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 78 555 3504: The second one will do fine ma'am. Thank you.
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
20/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you ma'am, I'm really looking forward to starting the discussions.
20/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I really like your spirit, Tinashe!
20/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let us connect on Tuesday to move ahead with our journey! I am so excited to have you on board!🚀🤝🏽
20/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you ma'am, we'll talk then.
23/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am, I'm good thanks and how are you?
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yess, we may begin. 👍🏽
23/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 555 3504: No ma'am, I do not.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand now.
23/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Ohh, okay. I'm grateful to have them on my side.
23/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes, it's very intriguing ma'am.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, let me get right on it.
23/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm done reading ma'am.
23/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. We will pick up from where we left off tomorrow.

Have a great day ahead! See you soon!
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes ma'am, let's begin.
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon.
24/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I like the part by the founder the most.
24/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, at this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 555 3504: That sounds amazing, I can't wait.
24/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Yes ma'am, I understand fully. Let me get right on it.
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I'm done with this ma'am.
24/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Well, from my understanding, I have to understand the market I'm going to be working at in the future and I have to start preparing for it at an early stage.
I have to familiarise myself with the digital and online mode of working. I would have to meet professionals be it online or via my own connections and setup a working relationship between their organisation and Edoofa.
24/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Haha, good one. 😂

Enjoy the rest of your day.
25/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinashe!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon ma'am.
Sorry for the delay.


That's quite a fascinating phenomenon.
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
25/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay ma'am.
25/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
25/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 555 3504: I have finished reading the document.
It details how I'm supposed to look for a business to partner up with Edoofa. I'm not supposed to find organisations or businesses that are too big or too small. These preferred business should be student centric, recreational or content centric. I'm also supposed to do a thorough background check on the organisation/business and it's founder as well to see if they meet the desired criteria.
25/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what , this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
25/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Thank you very much ma'am.
25/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

25/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*

25/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, thank you. I understand.
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While concluding our session let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution. People across the country come together for parades, flag hoisting, and cultural events. Looking forward to catching up with you on Monday! Have a wonderful Republic Day celebration!🇮🇳
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay. I've finished listening.

29/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Good afternoon!

I'll take a look a bit later, right now I do not have a secure Internet connection.
29/1/24, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 555 3504: For the second project I'm supposed to approach my peers and enlighten them about Edoofa.
I'm supposed to tell them about my experience with Edoofa mainly about my counsellors, the EWYL Program and expenses that come with the program.
Basically, I'm supposed to go out to my peers and try and show them the light that is joining the program.
29/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! ,I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like  to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
29/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, noted.
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, I understand. 👍🏽
29/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 555 3504: Okay, please do.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
