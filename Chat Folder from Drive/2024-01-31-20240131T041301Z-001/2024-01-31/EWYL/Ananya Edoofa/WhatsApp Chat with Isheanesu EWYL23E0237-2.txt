23/1/24, 11:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Isheanesu, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 522 7025: Noted mam. I am willing to volunteer but due to some barriers like distance and so on l might fail to physically connect with the team in time

Where do you live?
24/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 522 7025: Makumbe Buhera

I completely understand your concerns about the travel, and I appreciate your consideration. However, I want to emphasize that this event is not just a gathering; it's an investment in your future education.

Our founders are genuinely invested in your growth and success, and that's why they are making this journey. They are eager to establish a meaningful connection with you and your fellow students.

25/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I have some exciting news to share with you. Tomorrow, we are going to celebrate Republic Day! Now, let me tell you a bit about it.

Republic Day is a special day in India. It's a time when we remember and celebrate the day our country adopted its Constitution. Just like a constitution helps guide a country, ours outlines the rules and principles that make India the diverse and vibrant place it is.

On Republic Day, we have a big parade in the capital city, where people from all over the country come together to showcase our culture, traditions, and achievements. It's like a colorful and lively show with music, dance, and different displays. The Indian flag is hoisted, and everyone sings the national anthem with pride.

People also fly kites, dress up in traditional clothes, and enjoy delicious food! 🇮🇳✨

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 29 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges? <This message was edited>
