28/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good evening maam her are my forms for students that i have discussed with about Edoofa
29/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you? I'm a bit surprised to see progress on the projects. We haven't even started working together yet!
29/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Afternoon ma'am. I am good and you
30/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Good afternoon ma'am,  l am ready for today's session.
30/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nokuthaba!

How are you doing? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
30/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I am good thank you and how are you. I did not know that.Thats intresting.
30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
30/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 751 4112: My name is a Nokuthaba Anita Ncube. I am a Christian and I love to play tennis. My favorite tennis player is Serena Williams. In 5years time I see myself achieving my masters in Sociology. My goal in life is to be able to actually help and be an inspiration to the girl child and every child nationwide. I am a very free-spirited person which helps me to interact with people and makes people comfortable with me. I have sympathy which enables me to be remorseful for the most part it is a good thing as I feel to help people. <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you! 🌟 That's awesome that you're into tennis. Serena Williams is a legend! 🎾 And aiming for a master's in Sociology in 5 years – that's some serious ambition. 📚 Your goal of helping and inspiring the girl child is truly admirable. Keep that free-spirited vibe going, it's a superpower! 🌈 Sympathy is a beautiful quality, and using it to help others is incredible. 💖
30/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Indeed Serena Williams is a legend. Thank you so much for the motivational words maam.
30/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
30/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 751 4112: No maam i dont understand the two objectives.
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes maam i have understood
30/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
30/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Yes, it sounds intresting.
30/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
30/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 751 4112: The newsletter got me motivated and encouraged. I also gained a lot from the newsletter. Thank you ma'am.
30/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 751 4112: I  am done reading the newsletter maam
30/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
30/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 751 4112: Noted ma'am, thank you for today's session
