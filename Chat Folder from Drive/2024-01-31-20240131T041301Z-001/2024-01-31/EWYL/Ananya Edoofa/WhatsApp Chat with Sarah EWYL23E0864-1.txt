22/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a burst of motivation. Remember, each effort you put into our project is like planting a seed. Nurture it with dedication, watch it grow with collaboration, and soon you'll reap the rewards in the form of credits. Let's bring our collective brilliance to this project and make it shine. 

Together, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Let's go out there, give it our all, and earn those well-deserved credits! Until our next meeting, stay inspired and keep rocking!

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Sarah!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 758 5688: I'm doing great  Madam
