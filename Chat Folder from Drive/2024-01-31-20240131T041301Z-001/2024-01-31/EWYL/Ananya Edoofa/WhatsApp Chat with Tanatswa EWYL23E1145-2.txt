18/1/24, 7:59 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

I can see a short delay in initiating our journey together, however, due to bad health, I had to take a day off. By the way, I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

*_Did you know that a group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.' So, just like the flamboyance of flamingos, let's add a touch of flair to our session today._*

Ready to soar into the world of curiosity?🦩
22/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Good afternoon
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Sp, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
22/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
22/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 77 799 8533: My name is tanatswa
22/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up today's session, I want to leave you with a burst of motivation. Remember, each effort you put into our project is like planting a seed. Nurture it with dedication, watch it grow with collaboration, and soon you'll reap the rewards in the form of credits. Let's bring our collective brilliance to this project and make it shine. 

Together, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Let's go out there, give it our all, and earn those well-deserved credits! Until our next meeting, stay inspired and keep rocking!
22/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Thanks
23/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

How are you doing? Are you ready for your session?🚀
23/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 799 8533: afternoon
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Im sorry   for replying late , i am not feeling well
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am
24/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Oh okay
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes it is
24/1/24, 2:20 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

24/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 799 8533: The urge to self motivation
24/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
25/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You did not attend the session today as well, however let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution. People across the country come together for parades, flag hoisting, and cultural events. Looking forward to catching up with you on Monday! Have a wonderful Republic Day celebration!🇮🇳
25/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

Let us begin our session as I  wanted to quickly share how we celebrated Republic Day this year!

29/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Good afternoon
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
29/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. 

Have a good day ahead!🚀
30/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

How are you doing? Did you know that the longest river in the world is the Nile River in Africa, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)?🤔
