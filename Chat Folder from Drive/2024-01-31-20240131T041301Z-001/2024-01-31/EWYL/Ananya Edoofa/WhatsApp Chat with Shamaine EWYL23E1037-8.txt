5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to listen to the audio?

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am
Have a nice weekend and all the best to your students .
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shamaine!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:53 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
This wonderful news I wish  you and your students a wonderful time .
11/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shamaine!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 4:27 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I'm sorry for not being available there was no electricity
11/1/24, 4:28 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Have a goodnight ma'am
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shamaine

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good afternoon ma'am
12/1/24, 1:41 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Oh u did not know .it's a very amazing thing to learn
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Can you kindly explain them to me
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am this is a great goal
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Well understood.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:10 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
It's lovely to meet them and I can't wait for us to work together.
12/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes it's an interesting thing .
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
12/1/24, 2:30 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have read the newsletter.
12/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am
Have a wonderful weekend.

19/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Shamaine

Before beginning today's session, I want you to check out this incredible post : 

*https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==*
19/1/24, 8:41 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Good morning ma'am
19/1/24, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the document?
19/1/24, 8:43 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am I did
19/1/24, 8:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
19/1/24, 8:46 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
19/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 62 820 6650: So the EWYL program is going to help us stay aware and updated about the things and events happening around us .it will also help us acquire different skills such as digital marketing skills , social media literacy, creative content writing and teamwork.There are three projects in this document,the first is that Edoofians will represent Edoofa in different organisations and companies and make Edoofa sign contracts with these companies and form cooperate alliances .the second project is community building where Edoofians will reach out to their personal and extended networks and give them an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's educational system.This will be helping a lot of African students to apply at Edoofa.The third one is where the Edoofian students to to their local schools and tell the decision makers of the school for instance the headmaster about collaborating with  Edoofa .This only has to be senior secondary schools .The student will be paid with the completion of each activity and project .
19/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Shamaine!🚀
19/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
19/1/24, 9:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 9:15 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
19/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
19/1/24, 9:34 AM - +27 62 820 6650: The first thing is cooperate alliance .First the student has to identify companies that are technologically driven and make a list of such companies .You have to approach relatives , neighbors or friends parents who work in such companies and explain to them about the Edoofa program.The next step.is creating a LinkedIn account so as to communicate with the decision makers and human resources officers in these companies.Next you have to send them a request and I'd they accept it you connect them to the Edoofa team and set up a meeting so they sign a contract in regards to the alliance.
19/1/24, 11:03 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect on Monday since we don't have sessions over the weekend. Happy Weekend! 🚀
22/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shamaine!

Let us begin our session with an interesting fact!

22/1/24, 9:12 AM - +27 62 820 6650: The document is giving a guide in searching for companies . The first step is to look at the  nature of the company . There are different types of platforms and links of some platform based companies. The  next steps are to look at the financial stability of the company,its scale and the background of the company. This can be done on Google , LinkedIn,or crunchbase .When searching about the company one has to make sure that they read more on the company's foundation,it's function and area of expertise .After the search you study the company's website and check it's social media pages .The next thing is to check the background of the founder and reach out to the company's managers before the founder by sending invites and connection requests to them .
22/1/24, 9:16 AM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
22/1/24, 9:20 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am.
22/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
22/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
24/1/24, 8:59 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
24/1/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
24/1/24, 9:03 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay this is wonderful
24/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/1/24, 9:12 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/1/24, 9:27 AM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/1/24, 9:32 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
This is well noted
24/1/24, 9:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we wrap up, here's a quick joke to add a smile to your day:

Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

Thank you all for a great session. Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Until next time!🚀
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - +27 62 820 6650: 😄thank you ma'am
24/1/24, 9:35 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Have a wonderful day
25/1/24, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shamaine!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 8:48 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Good morning ma'am
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
25/1/24, 8:57 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

The students have to share the details about the Edoofa program with the principal or headmaster and also let them know that you want to set up a meeting for them and the Edoofa director to further discussion on the Edoofa program. You then share the headmaster's or principals contact details with the EWYL Mentor
25/1/24, 9:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
25/1/24, 9:48 AM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am
25/1/24, 9:48 AM - +27 62 820 6650: I have fully understood everything
25/1/24, 9:58 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for today's session! It was great discussing \ with you. Let's continue our conversation on Monday when we resume our sessions.

29/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As per our records, your school is already connected with us. Therefore,  I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
29/1/24, 9:22 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
29/1/24, 9:23 AM - +27 62 820 6650: I know a lot of schools in my province and I will look at them

30/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shamaine!

Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Good morning ma'am
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we plan for our sessions, you have the flexibility to choose between the following options:

Option 1: Monday and Thursday
Option 2: Tuesday and Friday
Feel free to select the days that best suit your schedule. Following your decision, I will provide you with an updated timetable.

Additionally, every Wednesday, I will share a piece of Wednesday wisdom, and we can discuss it in our subsequent session. Similarly, every Saturday, you will receive your weekend activity, and we will review it in our next session. Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
30/1/24, 9:00 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
30/1/24, 9:02 AM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am 😊
30/1/24, 9:03 AM - +27 62 820 6650: I'll go with option 2
30/1/24, 9:22 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Shamaine!
