22/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Isaac, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it's going to be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes proper time and effort, our team will be occupied so tight. Therefore, I was thinking of connecting only once a week for the time being.

Therefore, your new session timing will be *Every Tuesday, 9:30 a.m*. ⏰

Can't wait for this adventure together! 🚀

24/1/24, 10:29 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Isaac!

Now that your results are here, I hope you realize that you are one step closer to *your dream of studying in INDIA!* I understand there might be some challenges preventing you from attending your sessions regularly. However, why not step up and focus on financing your education while learning some valuable skills?

I've taken some time to discuss this with you. Remember, when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right? I believe we can make your parents' investment worth it. What do you think? Isn't it the right time?⌛

29/1/24, 8:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Isaac!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect earlier. You know, our whole is gearing up for a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town.

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
