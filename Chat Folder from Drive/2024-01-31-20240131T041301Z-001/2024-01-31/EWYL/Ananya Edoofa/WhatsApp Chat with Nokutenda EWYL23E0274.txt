23/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Nokutenda, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *Today, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
23/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 272 0741: I appreciate ma'am and l would be glad to be of help hence l volunteer

I won't spill all the details here, but I've recorded a special audio message filled with enthusiasm, encouragement and a whole lot of excitement. Your name is shining bright, and I can't wait for you to listen in on the great news.

So, go, play, and get ready for a burst of positivity coming your way! 🚀

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 18 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
30/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 272 0741: My plans to achieve the target of the month are to visit as many schools as l can and to interact with as many students as l can connect with.Also to make sure that the magnificent offers of Edoofa are known and spread to all the corners of my town ma'am.

I haven't been facing problems lately since schools have reopened
30/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 272 0741: I've submitted 24 forms this month ma'am
30/1/24, 10:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Apart from the ones you shared on Saturday and the 18 you shared with me in a single day, I cannot find another three. Can you help me with those?
30/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 272 0741: Okay
