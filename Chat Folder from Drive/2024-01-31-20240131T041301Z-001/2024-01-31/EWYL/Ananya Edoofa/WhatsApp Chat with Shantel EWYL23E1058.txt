24/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step._”* - Lao Tzu

As we embark on today's session, let's remember that every small effort contributes to significant progress. Let's take that first step together and make the most out of our time. Ready to dive in?
24/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes I'm ready
24/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Shantel, why are you late?
24/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Sorry ma'am my network was down
24/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
24/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Still downloading ma'am
24/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright! While the video is downloading why don't you tell me something more about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
24/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 741 8328: My name is Shantel Tinaye Mahachi. Am an A level student at Herentals College doing Arts subjects, History, Sociology and FRS
I like to play volley ball the most during my spare time. I would like to be a successful lawyer
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Volleyball sounds like a blast for downtime. Best of luck on your journey to becoming a successful lawyer – that's awesome! 🌟
24/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Thank you
24/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Nice to know you ma'am and thank you once again. I hope I will grow during the journey of the EWYL program
25/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shantel!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: 

The tongue of a blue whale, the largest animal on Earth, can weigh as much as an elephant. Despite their massive size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, using their enormous tongues to filter them from the water.🐋
25/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Good afternoon ma'am we can start pur session
25/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
25/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 77 741 8328: My name is Shantel Tinaye Mahachi. Am an A level student at Herentals College doing Arts subjects, History, Sociology and FRS
I like to play volley ball the most during my spare time. I would like to be a successful lawyer
25/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Oh, I got a bit confused, Shantel! We have already done that.😅
25/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Was also confused
25/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 741 8328: No you can explain them to me
25/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Its clear I understand
25/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Thank you for introducing me to the EWYL team. I am honored to be part of this program and look forward to working with everyone involved. It sounds like we have a strong team with a wide range of expertise and experience, and I am excited to learn from them and work with them to achieve our goals.
25/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes this sounds interesting, I'm following
25/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
25/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While concluding our session let me highlight that we will continue our conversation on Monday as we do not have our sessions over the weekend. Also, tomorrow, we won't be having our session as it's Republic Day in India. Wishing you a happy Republic Day! It's a special day when we celebrate the adoption of our constitution. People across the country come together for parades, flag hoisting, and cultural events. Looking forward to catching up with you on Monday! Have a wonderful Republic Day celebration!🇮🇳
25/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Sorry ma'am for being absent in the last minutes of our session I was in class
25/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 77 741 8328: Noted ma'am I wish you a happy Republic Day to you too
29/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shantel!

29/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

29/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
