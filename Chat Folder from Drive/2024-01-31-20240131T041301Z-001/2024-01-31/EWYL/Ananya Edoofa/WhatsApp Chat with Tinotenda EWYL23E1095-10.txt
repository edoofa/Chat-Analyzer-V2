Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you:

4/1/24, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one hour. If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.

I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 8:30 a.m. in the morning. <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Noted thanks
5/1/24, 8:34 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tinotenda!

 Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼
5/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 364 3205: morning how are you
5/1/24, 8:41 AM - +263 77 364 3205: We can start
5/1/24, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
5/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Not yet
5/1/24, 8:52 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Will you please enlight me on that
5/1/24, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
5/1/24, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
5/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay noted
5/1/24, 9:02 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
5/1/24, 9:09 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Thank you and I’m pleased to know them
5/1/24, 9:15 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
5/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah sure
5/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
5/1/24, 9:21 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 9:36 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Done ☑️

6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tinotenda!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 10:35 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Tinotenda!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 364 3205: It is well
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Wow that’s amazing

11/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
11/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Sounds great thanks
11/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session. Meanwhile, I want you to read the following document so that we can discuss this tomorrow. 

Remember that your consistency is something that will make you achieve heights! So always attend your session on time, and trust me, no one can stop you from earning credits!

Therefore, good luck, and see you tomorrow! <This message was edited>

*Identify Potential Candidates:* - Reach out to students in Form 6 or those who have recently passed Form 6 (A-Level Examination).

*Connect with Form 6 Divisions*: - Assume there are 3 divisions in Form 6, each with around 20 students. Begin with one division. Connect with these students and request to be added to their official or unofficial WhatsApp group.

*Share Your Group Link*: - Once added, share the link to your created WhatsApp group, explaining that it's an opportunity to pursue education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on tuition fees. Encourage them to join for more details.

*Repeat the Process*: - Move on to the next divisions of Form 6, applying the same approach. In this way, you'll reach at least 60 students (3 divisions of Form 6).

*Extend to Form 5*: - Repeat the process in Form 5, targeting another 60 students.
23/1/24, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *Result*:

23/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/1/24, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

Because of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable. Meanwhile, you can keep working on your targets and keep me posted on your EWYL group.

Now that we will be beginning our new journey. From now onwards we will be having our session on a dedicated EWYL Line. Please save the EWYL Line contact number: +91 98107 89170.

Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.

Both of these components are essential for your evaluation and progress, so ensure their completion.

It's crucial to note that you will only receive your lessons and activities if you follow your EWYL (Every Week, Your Life) ritual consistently. Make it a daily practice, especially in the morning, to ensure timely sharing of activities and lessons.
