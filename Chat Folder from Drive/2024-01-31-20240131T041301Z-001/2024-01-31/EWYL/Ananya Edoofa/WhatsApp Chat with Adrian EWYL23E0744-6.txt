26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Adrian!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you!

Well, what I have observed today is that if I have not shared a reminder with you before the session, you have clearly missed your session! Don't you think it's a bit irresponsible behavior? Do you get a reminder before your classes at school?

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤

How are you doing today? I've noticed you haven't attended your last two sessions with me. Since you always attend your sessions, I am quite worried. Are you alright?
4/1/24, 10:11 AM - +263 77 376 4957: Good morning...adrian might be facing a challenge with his phone ..no battery...electricity is scarce in zimbabwe..by the time hes online..he would have missed the sessions already..
5/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, @263773764957 

Kindly excuse me for not being able to respond earlier. That's alright I understand.

7/1/24, 8:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

I hope you are doing well. I have noticed that you are not following your EWYL ritual on time. It is crucial for you to follow the ritual as it ensures that you do not miss out on any information and important posts. Kindly do it right now, and let us proceed with our session!
15/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 376 4957: Good morning..adrian said he is communicating on the other group..EWYL line..
15/1/24, 10:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, he is connected with me!
18/1/24, 9:41 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Adrian!

I hope you are doing well. I've noticed that you consistently arrive late for your sessions. Is it challenging for you to be punctual for our sessions?
24/1/24, 10:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: *_🌟 URGENT UPDATE 🌟_*

Adrian, guess what? I'm super excited to share some awesome news – next month, we're planning a trip to Africa! 🌍 Yep, you heard it right! Our team is coming to your town. Just like last year, our students will be helping us organize the event, and we're looking for volunteers to join in and help manage everything! 🙌

Trust me, it will be an amazing experience with lots to learn! 🌈 Since planning this big event takes time and effort, our team will be so tight. 

In light of this, I'm proposing a slight adjustment to our session timetable. *As of now, we won't be having our session as initially planned. However, worry not! I will soon share an updated timetable* and I am confident that together, we will create something truly extraordinary.
30/1/24, 10:24 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Adrian

As the month is ending, I've been evaluating the performance of my students, and I noticed that you have made decent progress this month by sharing 11 offline application forms with me.

I understand that we haven't been connecting through our sessions lately; however, as your mentor, my priority is your progress, and I don't want you to compromise on that. Therefore, I have taken out some time specifically for you so that we can have a conversation about your progress.

So, tell me, what is your progress? What are your plans to achieve the target of the month? Are you facing any challenges?
