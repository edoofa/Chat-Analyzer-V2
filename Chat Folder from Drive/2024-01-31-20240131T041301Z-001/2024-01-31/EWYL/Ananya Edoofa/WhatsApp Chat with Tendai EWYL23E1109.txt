I trust this message finds you well. I am Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

I apologize for the slight delay from my end. The reason being, I am thrilled to share with you that our team is planning an Africa Trip next month. Just like last year, we have a lot to plan, and therefore, I have been occupied with the preparations.

Thank you for your understanding, and I am eager to start our journey in the EWYL program with you.
29/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We will be having our first session on 30th January and for that, I'd like to offer you a choice between two-time slots. Please select one that works for you:

Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM

30/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you so much for the detailed introduction.

Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?

30/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 340 7203: Not quite clear, please do share.
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 340 7203: oooh owkay, it is clear
30/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is tomorrow at the same time.
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 340 7203: thats fine, thank you for your team
30/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 340 7203: enjoy the rest of your day
