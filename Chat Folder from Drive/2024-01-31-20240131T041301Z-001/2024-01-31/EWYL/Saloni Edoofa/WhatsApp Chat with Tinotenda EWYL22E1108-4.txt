29/12/23, 4:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

19/1/24, 9:13 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust this message finds you well.

I am thrilled to reignite our weekly calls brimming with enthusiasm, passion, reflections on SLICE Con'24, updates on the $300 plan, and everything in between. Moreover, I am eagerly looking forward to our very first video call of the year 2024 🥺.

Without further ado, allow me to share the details for our upcoming call:

*Time*: 06:15 - 07:00 PM
*Link*: https://meet.google.com/qbb-ghae-rwj

Your participation is eagerly awaited! Let's make this call as vibrant and productive as our past discussions.
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day, Tinotenda
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Department of Student DSW) team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
