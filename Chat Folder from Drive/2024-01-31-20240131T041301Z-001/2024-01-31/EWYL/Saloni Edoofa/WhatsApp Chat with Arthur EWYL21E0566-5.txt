19/1/24, 10:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
19/1/24, 10:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
19/1/24, 10:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
19/1/24, 10:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
19/1/24, 10:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
19/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
19/1/24, 10:46 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you send them the message?
19/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 71 931 0305: The number l got is not available on WhatsApp
19/1/24, 11:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Our sessions will resume next week, from *Tuesday* onwards, between *10:00 - 11:00 AM*.

Just so you know, there will be no sessions held on Saturday and Sunday, allowing for a well-deserved break.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend ahead filled with joy and relaxation! 🌺
19/1/24, 11:55 AM - +263 71 931 0305: Thank you very 
Same too you
27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I hope you're doing well.

I know from the past few days, that I could not respond but allow me to share a story very close to my heart🫰🏻

I became a part of Edoofa almost two years back with initial thoughts on how my relationship would be, will I be a good mentor, or will I be able to think like my students, and so on. With these thoughts, I began my journey. Honestly speaking, I learned a lot each day, and yes, made some mistakes but I did not know that now there is going something that I will cherish for my lifetime, our bond. In this journey so far, I have guided more than 500 students, and beyond guidance I have made sure that I can create a transformation in their lives🌟
27/1/24, 7:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: As an individual, I always believe that the learning process is life never ends and the more you learn, the better the guidance becomes, with a heavy heart, *I've chosen to immerse myself in higher education, and as a result, I'll be taking a step back from being your mentor🥺*
*You have a special place in my heart, and I am profoundly thankful for the honor of being your mentor*. Our journey doesn't end here; it merely takes a different course. I have full confidence in your continued success.

*I want to assure you that the Mentorship team will reach out to you soon to discuss the upcoming plan and ensure a seamless transition.*
All the best🫶🏻
27/1/24, 9:54 PM - +263 71 931 0305: Okay but this  is a sad message to be honest l wish you could stay and continue to be my mentor you were the best and also you still the best mentor l ever had.Am wishing you all the best as you immerse yourself to higher education
29/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 71 931 0305: Good Afternoon
30/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 71 931 0305: Good morning
