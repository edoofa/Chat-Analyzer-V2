15/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 653 0616: The A level results came out, and I didn't do well. I have got 3 points. I just want a clarification, if I am still eligible to continue with the Program.
16/1/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Melisa,

I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*.  I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 10:12 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 78 653 0616: Thank you so much for sharing the great news
16/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 653 0616: My family and I are doing quite well, thank you.
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 346 7191: Very inspiring indeed and even us as Parents to the daughter Melisa T. Tsvangirai, we feel honored. We wish humble ourselves to be part of the great Edoofa Family through our daughter whom you admitted so kindly and honourably indeed. 

Regards 
Eladios Tsvangirai as the father to Melisa.
16/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to know that. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

17/1/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Melisa.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you did go through the message above. I am happy to know that. Over the past couple of days, we also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 77 365 9499: Greetings, noted.

17/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 78 653 0616: Thank you
18/1/24, 12:30 AM - +263 77 346 7191: This is amazingly fantastic and we look forward to hearing from you then. I am sure that once we have heard from you as you have reiterated, we will be in a position to navigate our daughter's future in a more cautious and focused manner thereto.
22/1/24, 8:06 AM - +263 78 653 0616: Greetings
23/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 78 653 0616: Greatings ma'am, I am patiently waiting for your feedback prior to the issue of the evaluation process of my results.
24/1/24, 12:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Melisa,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 346 7191: Warm Greetings Mum.
I am Eladios Tsvangirai, the father to Melisa Tariro Tsvangirayi.
I have been equally wondering whether you were still checking on the modalities of giving us a life lime response to Melisa's request especially that she had written to your good offices over her legibility to continue after the three points she got out her A'levels recently.
24/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 77 346 7191: As a parent, I have been noticing some stressful emotions on my daughter Melissa after getting the results which were not as pleasing as expected. Right now she is not home since she had requested for a refreshing environment at her sister in-law since she was not so sure if she was going to be responded to by your good offices thereto. 
I am very sorry that you were out of office due to the reason you have shared with us this morning. 
Having said thus, Melisa is very expectantly looking forward to your update Mum.

Regards,

Parent
25/1/24, 9:11 AM - +263 78 653 0616: Greetings ma'am
27/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 77 346 7191: Greetings ma'am. We are waiting patiently and expectantly for your feedback this end. We were hoping that you would resume the discussions sooner as you had noted that you had improved health wise, but we have not heard from you ever since. 

Reagards,

Melisa Tsvangirayi T

30/1/24, 7:32 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, regarding your A Level results, Ms. Kirti had shared the same concern before her absence and since then I have followed up with the academic board and the university officials to chart the way forward for her higher education.
30/1/24, 7:32 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: In light of the same, I wanted to connect with you and help you address your concerns in a better way, guide you on how the admission process will work from here and what is it that you can do.
