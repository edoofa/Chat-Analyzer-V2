I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/1/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/1/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:30 PM to 03:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 797 2255: I am so happy I got admitted
Thank you mam.

17/1/24, 11:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tapiwanashe,

I hope you are doing well. Let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 01:30 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your University admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 797 2255: Good morning mam
Ok thank you.Noted.
17/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 797 2255: I recently received my results mam and it's so saddening that they didn't come out well as expected.

Personally I  am not pleased with the results looking at the investment and hardwork I gave in.

We wrote our exams in a year which was full of disturbances.We were having The Country's Presidential Elections that disturbed the whole year's learnings.
The program called out for all civil servants including my A level teachers.
They went out for months .
I relied on relief teachers who could be with me here and there.I had no reliable teachers specifically for my A level subjects that's why I resorted to extra lessons.

The results that I hold right now mainly came out of my hardwork through extra lessons.
I got three (3) A levels however I have not yet collected the result slip,I researched online.

Again our class also got affected by Covid-19 during our lower 6.I hope you  consider me because I am still interested in the program.
I am also worried about my colleagues that I encouraged to join the program who are asking if I am still proceeding with Edoofa.
I don't want to disappoint them.
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 797 2255: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Thanks man.I am really grateful and appreciative. I am thankful to you and team. Thank you so much. I had bundles so I currently going through the letter. The scheduled time of 1:30  to 3:00 pm is ok for us. We will be ready
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Yes man. We as parents have gone through the letter and accepted it with gratitude. However there are some grey areas which need some clarifications:
1.If we pay £700 within 30 days, how long do we take to offset the balance of £250 (from£950 per semester)
2.Can you shed light on accommodation and its charges .
3.What do you mean by "not opted" on meal plan,laundry facility,requested accommodation?
4.Is the admission processing fee of £200 covered in the £700
5.Can someone with BSc in Chemistry become a Pharmacist
6.Where and when will the £350 we paid considered?
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.

Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
17/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 317 8669: We are all ready mam

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

17/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 797 2255: ok sure.Thank you
17/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.

17/1/24, 6:27 PM - +263 78 797 2255: okay mam thanks
18/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 78 317 8669: Ok mam. Thanks
18/1/24, 12:26 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Morning mam
20/1/24, 6:29 AM - +263 78 317 8669: Hello mam
24/1/24, 1:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwanashe,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, since we were unable to complete our letter discussion so let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
24/1/24, 5:44 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Ok mam.Sorry for being unwell.However we thank God for healing you. We will be ready at 600pm mam
24/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Our weekend was very much ok
24/1/24, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Now available mam.Let's proceed
24/1/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can proceed now. I appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.

Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.
24/1/24, 7:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 78 317 8669: I am ready mam
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
24/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Clear mam
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
24/1/24, 7:32 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Understood
24/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
24/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
24/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Clear
24/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
24/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Is the 75 and already included in the 975 or to be added to it
24/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, it is included in the $975.
24/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on  January 30th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
24/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please and thanks for the grant
24/1/24, 8:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 8:49 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Yes thank you. Can proceed
24/1/24, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 9:15 PM - +263 78 317 8669: No some 150km away.For previous payment I paid through Mr Shorwi who was said to be an agent. Not sure if the same can apply
24/1/24, 9:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 9:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 9:26 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Thanks I have saved the contact
24/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
24/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
24/1/24, 9:32 PM - +263 78 317 8669: May be for Mr Rajan only. For Mr Shorwi I have the details
24/1/24, 9:35 PM - +263 78 317 8669: I also would like to inform you that I prefer to split the payment of 600 over two splits as have been said above.I am now working sleeplessly to source for the money
24/1/24, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
24/1/24, 9:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that it is alright please.
24/1/24, 9:44 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Thank you so much mam
24/1/24, 9:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
24/1/24, 9:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, they can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
24/1/24, 9:55 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Clear mam
24/1/24, 9:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/1/24, 10:09 PM - +263 78 317 8669: I have no question related to admission but on course to be trained on. We once requested for change of course and were advised to write an email which we did but no response was given. Instead the initial course"Chemistry" is the one that came on offer letter. My daughter had a passion on medicine but could not fit in since she had no physics. But she is looking for a health related courses. E.g. Biotech, etc. Is there likely wood to change?
24/1/24, 10:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263783178669 thank you for letting me know that however, to pursue medicine in India, a combined science of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology is required since Tapiwanashe does not have Physics as her A-level subject combination so please stay assured the course offered to her during her counseling session is as per the career aspirations that she wish to do.
24/1/24, 10:16 PM - +263 78 317 8669: Ok
24/1/24, 10:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
24/1/24, 10:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
24/1/24, 10:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

26/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tapiwanashe!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 797 2255: Good afternoon mam.
Yes we did review it
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 797 2255: It was good,we have no problem but the problem arises on the coarse you gave me.I had an appeal to change the program from BSC in Chemistry to BSC in Biochemistry but no response was received.
26/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 78 317 8669: We really are grateful mam. Our worry lies on the course to be trained in. She really wants to change the course
