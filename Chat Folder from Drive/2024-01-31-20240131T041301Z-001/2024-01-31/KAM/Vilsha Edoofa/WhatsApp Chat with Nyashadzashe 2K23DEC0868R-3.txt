26/12/23, 6:21 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l am
26/12/23, 6:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l agree
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 6:26 PM - +267 74 197 595: The exams were already written in November 2023 and we are waiting for the results that will be out early February 2024
26/12/23, 6:27 PM - +267 74 197 595: So there is no reappearance
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l m clear
26/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m understanding point 1 and 2
26/12/23, 6:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: I have no queries
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Nyashadzashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes
26/12/23, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day evening and please extend our regards to your family as well. We will only be able to share your application with the universities when you will be able to share your letter of recommendation or the statement of entry for A level

We are looking forward
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
17/1/24, 1:51 PM - +267 74 238 400: 1. 900
2. 3 years
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 238 400: 3.$ 300
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 238 400: 4. $750
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - +267 74 197 595: 1 The tuition is 900 usd
2 standard duration of course is 3 years
3 procedure fee 300usd
4 registration 750usd
17/1/24, 1:53 PM - +267 74 238 400: Yes its clear
17/1/24, 1:53 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes it clarifies
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/1/24, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/1/24, 2:06 PM - +267 74 197 595: I would like to ask on campus accommodation  is the money paid once off or interms
17/1/24, 2:09 PM - +267 74 197 595: Then is it shared equally amongst the 3 seater or it's an amount per head
17/1/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, however, may I know which accommodation are you referring to before I help you understand?
17/1/24, 2:45 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m referring to the on campus accommodation
17/1/24, 2:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: Is the 2000 usd divided amongst the 3  students or it's charged per head and is it a once off payment or to be paid in terms
17/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I have taken note of your concerns. I would love to continue with our discussion however, for now, I will not be available to connect since I am heading for my dinner break, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm CAT so that we can continue with our discussion without any issues, have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 4:39 PM - +267 74 197 595: Alright

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 1:18 PM - +267 74 197 595: Good afternoon
24/1/24, 1:19 PM - +267 74 197 595: Last week wasn't well for us with a lot of anxiety because of questions we didn't manage to get answers as time was moving
24/1/24, 1:21 PM - +267 74 197 595: We wish you a speedy recovery as a family
24/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry that you have to go through all of that because of the questions that were not answered because of me, however, I will be able to clear your concerns better now. So please do not worry about that. And thank you for your warm wishes.

24/1/24, 1:45 PM - +267 74 197 595: The balance was $150  plus 12.5 % for the bank charges that is $93 75 
So in total we paid $194
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: Now my concern was on the accommodation issue
24/1/24, 1:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
24/1/24, 1:49 PM - +267 74 197 595: This one the on campus accommodation 
1.I wanted clarity on the $2000 for a 3 seater whether the amount is divided between the 3 students.
2. I was also kindly asking for 2 more universities to be able to compare if it's possible
24/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns, since we were unable to complete our letter discussion so let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
24/1/24, 4:03 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l will be available
24/1/24, 5:53 PM - +267 74 238 400: Good evening
24/1/24, 6:19 PM - +267 74 197 595: Good evening
24/1/24, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes we are available
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, now  coming back to the concern you shared above. Let me help you understand the on-campus accommodation you are talking about above is an annual individual amount which includes your food, water bill, electricity bill and wifi expenses as well.
24/1/24, 6:39 PM - +267 74 197 595: Ooh okay l get you
24/1/24, 6:40 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m kindly asking for 2 more universities to compare especially on on campus accommodation if possible
24/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
24/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
24/1/24, 6:43 PM - +267 74 197 595: Alright
24/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
24/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - +267 74 238 400: l also have Lovely Professional University on my mind
24/1/24, 6:54 PM - +267 74 197 595: I wad also requesting for LPU especially on on campus accommodation
24/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
24/1/24, 6:58 PM - +267 74 238 400: No we are not aware
24/1/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
24/1/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/1/24, 7:02 PM - +267 74 197 595: Ooh okay
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear with your concerns now?
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - +267 74 197 595: It's alright we will also wait patiently for other responses from other universities
24/1/24, 7:05 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l m clear
24/1/24, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we can wait and for now let us discuss the offer letter in detail so that you have a better understanding of the letter in detail, so may I know if you are ready now?
24/1/24, 7:09 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes we are ready
24/1/24, 7:10 PM - +267 74 238 400: We are ready
24/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
24/1/24, 7:12 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes it does
24/1/24, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
24/1/24, 7:15 PM - +267 74 238 400: I am clear
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - +267 74 238 400: Lets move on
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 30 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
24/1/24, 7:17 PM - +267 74 238 400: Yes we are together
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes we are
24/1/24, 7:20 PM - +267 74 197 595: We once paid $350  at the start is it the same that is waived
24/1/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No please, let me help you explain the $350 you paid before is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is basically for the scholarship application where we apply your application with multiple universities, your SOP, while this is the admission processing is different and while processing your application we had already taken care of the same so you do not have to worry about that.
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - +267 74 197 595: Ooh okay it's clear now
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - +267 74 197 595: We can proceed
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 30th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 7:30 PM - +267 74 197 595: Its now clear
24/1/24, 7:31 PM - +267 74 197 595: Though the payment options were not clear on the offer letter
24/1/24, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - +267 74 197 595: We are Zimbabweans staying in Botswana
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 7:36 PM - +267 74 197 595: I do have a for foreign currency exchange bank here
24/1/24, 7:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 7:41 PM - +267 74 197 595: Is there an option to transfer money from my bank account straight to your bank account like from my employers  account straight into your account provided
24/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can certainly do that by making a deposit directly to the bank details mentioned in the offer letter.
24/1/24, 7:43 PM - +267 74 197 595: Thank you
24/1/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. If you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
24/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
24/1/24, 7:46 PM - +267 74 197 595: Noted with thanks
24/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
24/1/24, 7:47 PM - +267 74 197 595: Noted
24/1/24, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
24/1/24, 7:53 PM - +267 74 197 595: Let me see if l m understanding better
Per semester tuition  is $900 
Of which l  supposed to pay  $750 by 30 January minus the $100 Edoofa grant summing it to $650  by the end of January or in instalments of 30 days apart is that so
24/1/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
24/1/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
24/1/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
24/1/24, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
24/1/24, 8:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
24/1/24, 8:07 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes l understood
24/1/24, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
24/1/24, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
24/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
24/1/24, 8:13 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes it clarifies and it's a very good program
24/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
24/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/1/24, 8:17 PM - +267 74 197 595: No queries at the moment
24/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
24/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
24/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
24/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities

24/1/24, 8:26 PM - +267 74 238 400: Thank you
24/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome,  before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
24/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realising your dream of pursuing education abroad.
24/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Friday which is 26th Jan. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
24/1/24, 8:30 PM - +267 74 238 400: Yes it sounds good
24/1/24, 8:39 PM - +267 74 197 595: Yes it sounds good and we are also waiting for any other responses from other universities
25/1/24, 1:36 AM - Akshit Kam: You deleted this message
26/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyashadzashe!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - +267 74 238 400: Yes we had an opportunity to do so
26/1/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - +267 74 197 595: Good afternoon 
Yes we did
26/1/24, 4:12 PM - +267 74 197 595: We have seen it and discussed about it and suggested for 2 more universities to compare
26/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. It is alright please if you do not wish to reserve your seat with Galgotias University we completely respect your decision, however, if you wish to wait for more offers you can surely do that but if those offers do not align with your preference or you may consider that the amount asked might be expensive then please remember you would have even lost this opportunity, and that is the reason I would want you to think first make use of the transfer option and then select. If I were at your place I would keep two options open for myself rather than just waiting for the one.
26/1/24, 5:58 PM - +267 74 197 595: I m kindly asking for 2 more universities to choose
26/1/24, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @26774197595 if you wish to have 2 more universities you will need to get however, you need to understand that we are connected with many universities, and with the A-level result being announced we have 1000+ students who are now applying for scholarship opportunities. Hence evaluation at every university takes time and once we receive updates from other universities then only we will be able to notify you however, in the meantime if you miss this opportunity you will not be able to reserve your seat with this university again since you would already have missed on the opportunity and the university has to be fair to all the students as well. And it being your admission officer I would suggest you make use of the transfer option explained to you it is always better to have the opportunity secured than be lost.
29/1/24, 9:06 AM - +267 74 197 595: Good morning 
I'm getting you very well
But l m kindly asking for 2 more universities so that l can have a wider choice
30/1/24, 8:02 AM - +267 74 197 595: Good morning
30/1/24, 6:53 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyashadzashe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa*.
