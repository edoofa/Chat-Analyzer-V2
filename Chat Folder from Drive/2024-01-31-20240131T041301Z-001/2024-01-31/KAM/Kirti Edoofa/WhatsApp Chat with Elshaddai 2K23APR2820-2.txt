I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the document, it is duly noted with us. We shall now share your application with the universities. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 248 3564: It's all fine thanks

24/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Elshaddai,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 78 956 1557: We good glad to hear from you
24/1/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Elshaddai,

I trust you're well and that you had a productive weekend. I'm following up regarding the fee breakdown I shared with you on Saturday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Elshaddai,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Over the past couple of days, I have been reaching out to you to discuss your offer letter from *Galgotias University*, which is ranked in the top 100 universities in India. 

My intention is to help you understand the next steps for your university admission journey and guide you in the right direction. However, it seems as if my messages have not been able to get through.
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recognize, the Edoofa scholarship opportunity is highly competitive, with students from all over the world vying for the scholarship and you have been given a valuable chance to shape your future path.
30/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If I know you well from our past discussions, this is not something you will lose out on easily. Hence, that is the reason, I am a bit worried because you have not connected with us over the past couple of days. I believe something must have been bothering you that has prevented you from connecting with us. Is my understanding correct?
30/1/24, 6:57 PM - +27 60 485 9077: It's a gud evening
30/1/24, 6:59 PM - +27 60 485 9077: We are sorry we couldn't for the past days due to some other comitment ...nevertheless we will try b all means to attend this issue of paramount importance to us
30/1/24, 7:00 PM - +27 60 485 9077: I Kno sometimes we fail due to power issue coz the fons will be without much power ..,but we will try and make sure we do all what is necessary to pull thru within the timeframe expected
30/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, @27604859077, that you may have been occupied with prior commitments, which could explain why you haven't been able to connect with us. However, I noticed that none of your family members were available as well, which concerned us greatly. The offer letters you received are time-sensitive, and with each passing day, there's a risk of missing out on your scholarship opportunity.

Nevertheless, I am glad to see that you recognize these challenges and are willing to make an effort to be available over the next couple of days. Am I correct in understanding your situation?
30/1/24, 7:22 PM - +27 60 485 9077: Yes your understanding is correct and I think regardless of our challenges something can be done ....we will talk about it and see how best we can handle it
30/1/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, @27604859077, and if you are on the right track, I would want to do my very best to help you here. According to our previous discussions, you received an offer letter from Galgotias University, but we never had the chance to discuss the letter. The discussion will take at least 45 minutes of our time, and hence, I want to understand when we can discuss the same letter so that we can help you with the way forward before time runs out. When would be a convenient time for you to discuss this matter?
30/1/24, 8:58 PM - +27 60 485 9077: Thts what we are organizing to try and have someone available at convenient times
