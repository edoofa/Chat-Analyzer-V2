8/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Deborah 2K23DEC2678)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
8/1/24, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Deborah EWYL23E1152)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 1:21 PM - +260 763785676: I am clear with the purpose of the two groups.
8/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

He really helped me with understanding all this.
8/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience!

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
8/1/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
8/1/24, 2:54 PM - +260 763785676: Can a testimonial be required?
8/1/24, 6:07 PM - +260 763785676: We will be able to send it on Wednesday if we manage to get it.

8/1/24, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you would like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
8/1/24, 7:41 PM - +260 763785676: From 12:30 PM to 08:30 PM is okay.
8/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session.

10/1/24, 12:31 PM - +260 97 9988111: Good afternoon too thanks.

10/1/24, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
10/1/24, 12:44 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
10/1/24, 12:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 12:48 PM - +260 763785676: I have gone through it.
10/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/1/24, 12:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
10/1/24, 12:52 PM - +260 763785676: They are clear.
10/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/1/24, 12:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
10/1/24, 12:59 PM - +260 763785676: I am following.
10/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
10/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
10/1/24, 1:08 PM - +260 763785676: They are clear
10/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/1/24, 1:10 PM - +260 763785676: Yes we can start.
10/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
10/1/24, 1:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
10/1/24, 1:17 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
10/1/24, 1:48 PM - +260 763785676: I want to go through them today. I have already started going through them.
10/1/24, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please in that case, may I know by what time you will be done going through the videos?
10/1/24, 2:03 PM - +260 763785676: 14:30
10/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please I shall wait for your response.
10/1/24, 3:13 PM - +260 763785676: I'm having challenges with opening the third video.
10/1/24, 3:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260763785676 thank you for letting me know that. May I know if you would want me to share the audio version of the video 3?
10/1/24, 3:19 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
10/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the audio version of video 3
10/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 3:23 PM - +260 763785676: Thank you
10/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
10/1/24, 4:01 PM - +260 763785676: I understood that as a student I must be teachable, must be willing to learn what is been taught and must be open-minded. As a student I must follow all the Efooda's instructions to speed up processes like traveling issues and many more. Edoofa gives scholarships to make education affordable not only that but to also take someone's capacity to a whole excess. Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program. Students of the Edoofa program earning and learning to success, but its also focused on increasing students capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent. Students understand that Edoofa has invested a lot of time  to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. Founders encourage students like me to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions. Statement of purpose is an important document students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the forms in time to make sure programs are not delayed. But most importantly students should follow the rules, instructions and steps given to them.
10/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
10/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
10/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/1/24, 4:07 PM - +260 763785676: Thank you for the information.
10/1/24, 4:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/1/24, 4:09 PM - +260 763785676: Yes we are
10/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
10/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/1/24, 8:56 AM - +260 763785676: Good morning. Hope you are doing well.  There is an error the course indicated in the document is not the one I applied for.
11/1/24, 11:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Deborah.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that, it must have been an error, kindly excuse me for that. Let me share the correct academic questions
11/1/24, 11:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 11:43 AM - +260 763785676: Thank you
11/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
11/1/24, 1:59 PM - +260 763785676: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:03 PM - +260 763785676: Compilers and interpreters are both tools used in the execution of computer programs, but they differ in their approaches to translating high-level code into machine-readable instructions. 

A compiler transforms the entire source code of a program into machine code or an intermediate code in a single batch before execution. This compiled code can be executed multiple times without the need for recompilation. While the initial compilation may take longer, the overall execution tends to be faster as the compiled code is optimized for the specific target platform. Languages like C and C++ often use compilers.

On the other hand, an interpreter translates the source code into machine code or an intermediate code line by line, executing each line immediately. Interpreters are generally more flexible as they can adapt to changes in the code on-the-fly, but this flexibility often comes at the cost of slower overall execution speed. Languages like Python and JavaScript are commonly interpreted.

In summary, compilers translate the entire code before execution, optimizing for performance, while interpreters execute code line by line, offering flexibility but potentially sacrificing speed.

11/1/24, 2:08 PM - +260 763785676: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, and the academic documents it is well noted with us. I shall wait for your response to the first question.
11/1/24, 2:39 PM - +260 763785676: 2. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are crucial components in the digital world, shaping how users interact with technology. UI refers to the visual elements and design of an interface, while UX encompasses the overall experience, focusing on user satisfaction. In today's digital landscape, seamless and intuitive UI/UX is paramount for success. With the proliferation of smartphones and web applications, users demand not just functionality but also a delightful and efficient experience. Well-designed UI/UX enhances accessibility, reduces friction, and fosters user engagement. Companies investing in thoughtful design gain a competitive edge by creating products that resonate with users, driving loyalty and positive word-of-mouth. As technology evolves, staying attuned to user preferences and evolving design trends remains essential for delivering exceptional UI/UX in the dynamic digital realm.
11/1/24, 2:41 PM - +260 763785676: 3. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer performs specific tasks, and the model facilitates interoperability between different systems.

1. **Physical Layer:** The lowest layer deals with the physical connection between devices. It includes specifications for cables, connectors, and hardware.

2. **Data Link Layer:** Responsible for node-to-node communication, this layer handles framing, addressing, and error detection to ensure reliable data transfer.

3. **Network Layer:** Focused on routing and logical addressing, this layer manages packet forwarding across different networks. It establishes the most efficient path for data to travel.

4. **Transport Layer:** Ensuring end-to-end communication, this layer manages error recovery, flow control, and data segmentation. It establishes reliable connections and ensures data integrity.

5. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions or connections between applications, providing synchronization and dialog control during communication.

6. **Presentation Layer:** Deals with data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that the application layer can understand the exchanged information.

7. **Application Layer:** The top layer interacts directly with end-user applications, providing network services like email, file transfer, and remote login.

Understanding the OSI model aids in troubleshooting, designing networks, and ensuring compatibility across diverse systems.
11/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 763785676: 4. Programming involves creating sets of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task. It is the process of designing and building executable computer programs. Programming languages serve as the medium through which humans communicate with computers, providing a structured way to express algorithms and logic.

In today's applications, several programming languages are widely used due to their versatility and suitability for different tasks. Python is renowned for its readability and simplicity, making it a favorite for beginners and widely adopted in fields like web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. JavaScript is fundamental for web development, enabling dynamic and interactive content. Java, known for its platform independence, is prevalent in enterprise-level applications. C++ is valued for its performance and is often used in systems programming and game development. Meanwhile, languages like C# and Swift are popular for building desktop and mobile applications, respectively.

Ultimately, the choice of programming language depends on the specific requirements of a project, emphasizing factors such as ease of development, performance, and the target application domain.
11/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, I shall wait for your response to the first question.
11/1/24, 2:45 PM - +260 763785676: I'm attending to it right now.
11/1/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I shall wait for your response.
11/1/24, 3:55 PM - +260 763785676: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
11/1/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
11/1/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors in Computer Application for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
11/1/24, 7:45 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
11/1/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move ahead I have some news to share with you.

https://chat.whatsapp.com/IVyVHUWTGJUDlPmkEfUIeZ

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Deborah Kambatika, and my EWYL group name is Deborah EWYL23E1152. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
11/1/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
11/1/24, 7:54 PM - +260 763785676: Noted with thanks
11/1/24, 8:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know if you are ready to move ahead with our discussion now?
11/1/24, 8:17 PM - +260 763785676: I'm ready, we can move on.
11/1/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
11/1/24, 8:28 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
11/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
11/1/24, 8:43 PM - +260 763785676: How much is the balance because my mom deposited $350.
11/1/24, 8:44 PM - +260 763785676: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the above message it was for one of the other students who is also named Deborah and by mistake it was shared with you since I was even having a conversation with you. So please do not worry about that.
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - +260 763785676: Okay we have noted it.
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great now. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/1/24, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/1/24, 8:53 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/1/24, 8:56 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
11/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/1/24, 9:01 PM - +260 763785676: Yes we are. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/1/24, 9:05 PM - +260 763785676: Yes I have.
11/1/24, 9:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
11/1/24, 9:13 PM - +260 763785676: Noted
11/1/24, 9:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/1/24, 9:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/1/24, 9:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/1/24, 9:15 PM - +260 763785676: Noted
11/1/24, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/1/24, 9:24 PM - +260 763785676: There are no queries.
11/1/24, 9:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would love to continue with our discussion now since it has been a long day for me and my available hours are now over let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm I hope you will be available have a blessed night ahead.
11/1/24, 9:35 PM - +260 763785676: Have a blessed night too.

12/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
12/1/24, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
12/1/24, 1:56 PM - +260 763785676: Noted with thanks.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +260 763785676: I have reviewed them.
12/1/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/1/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level. Grade 10 and 12 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
12/1/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - +260 763785676: Noted with thanks
12/1/24, 2:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/1/24, 2:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/1/24, 2:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/1/24, 2:25 PM - +260 763785676: It does.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/1/24, 2:37 PM - +260 763785676: It does.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/1/24, 2:40 PM - +260 763785676: I have followed the details.
12/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level / garde 12 results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/1/24, 3:27 PM - +260 763785676: I'm aware.
12/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/1/24, 3:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/1/24, 3:30 PM - +260 763785676: I can see.
12/1/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their / grade 12 exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/1/24, 3:32 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
12/1/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/1/24, 3:36 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
12/1/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level/ Grade 12*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/1/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/1/24, 3:41 PM - +260 763785676: Yes I am.
12/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue
12/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/1/24, 3:44 PM - +260 763785676: Yes I am.
12/1/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/1/24, 3:46 PM - +260 763785676: Noted.
12/1/24, 3:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/1/24, 3:48 PM - +260 763785676: I'm clear.
12/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/1/24, 3:56 PM - +260 763785676: Yes I am.
12/1/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/1/24, 4:02 PM - +260 763785676: Have a blessed day too. Noted, I will patiently wait for the offer later.
16/1/24, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Deborah,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

17/1/24, 10:22 AM - +260 763785676: Noted.
17/1/24, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

17/1/24, 1:45 PM - +260 763785676: Yes. We can move forward.
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/1/24, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

17/1/24, 1:57 PM - +260 763785676: This message was deleted
17/1/24, 2:00 PM - +260 763785676: 1.$350
2.$0
3. $1600
4.sports $125
    Misc $125
5. $1000
17/1/24, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/1/24, 2:06 PM - +260 763785676: It really is. I agree with you.
17/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussion however, for now, I will not be available to connect since I am heading for my dinner break, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm CAT so that we can continue with our discussion without any issues, have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 4:40 PM - +260 763785676: Have a blessed day too.
24/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Deborah,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 4:28 PM - +260 763785676: We are doing fine and it's good that you are feeling better.
24/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing fine and thank you for your concern, since we were unable to complete our letter discussion so let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
24/1/24, 4:31 PM - +260 763785676: I will be available.
24/1/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can connect and continue with our discussion?
24/1/24, 6:24 PM - +260 763785676: I am available.
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, so may I know if you are clear so far?
24/1/24, 6:34 PM - +260 763785676: You are clear.
24/1/24, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
24/1/24, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
24/1/24, 6:47 PM - +260 763785676: It does.
24/1/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
24/1/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
24/1/24, 6:50 PM - +260 763785676: I have gone through it.
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
24/1/24, 6:55 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
24/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
24/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
24/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
24/1/24, 6:56 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
24/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
24/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
24/1/24, 6:59 PM - +260 763785676: This message was deleted
24/1/24, 7:00 PM - +260 763785676: I have a question.
24/1/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please?
24/1/24, 7:01 PM - +260 763785676: So I have to pay $1850 and $1000?
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260763785676 let me help you understand. This fee of $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
24/1/24, 7:04 PM - +260 763785676: We are clear.
24/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.
24/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
24/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
24/1/24, 7:07 PM - +260 763785676: Yes I do.
24/1/24, 7:09 PM - +260 763785676: I would opt for a scholarship offer that forces me to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee.
24/1/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
24/1/24, 7:11 PM - +260 763785676: I am clear.
24/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 30th, 2024*.
24/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 7:13 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
24/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 30, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 29, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - +260 763785676: We are.
24/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 10% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - +260 763785676: Let me confirm from my mother.
24/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. That is alright please, let me share the account details just for your reference:

*Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda
*Sort Code* - 090122
*Swift Code* - INZAZMLX
24/1/24, 7:31 PM - +260 763785676: Thank you.
24/1/24, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - +260 763785676: I have no questions.
24/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

24/1/24, 7:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the offer letter. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter as a collective?
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - +260 763785676: We did.
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/1/24, 2:45 PM - +260 763785676: We will proceed with sending the money soon.
26/1/24, 2:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

26/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I am sure you will. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of 30th January 2024, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $450, or you can opt to pay the full $900 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - +260 763785676: Yes.
26/1/24, 3:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
26/1/24, 3:15 PM - +260 763785676: I have to ask my mother in when she is planning to pay but she wants to use the $450 payment.
26/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260763785676 thank you for letting me know that may I know by when will your mother be able to update about the same?
26/1/24, 3:25 PM - +260 763785676: Let me confirm.
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I will wait for your response.
30/1/24, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Deborah,

I hope you are doing well, and I find you in the best of sports. I was going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your first part of the university registration fee of $450 by today, 30th of January 2024.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board and the university officials accordingly?
30/1/24, 7:04 PM - +260 763785676: We were not able to make the payment today.
30/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that you were not able to make the payment of your fee today. May I inquire, @260763785676, what specific challenges you encountered that prevented you from meeting the deadline and potentially risking the entire scholarship opportunity that you worked so hard for?
30/1/24, 7:12 PM - +260 763785676: The money is not enough.
30/1/24, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand that, @260763785676. However, if that was the case, may I know why you did not take the initiative to discuss this challenge with us and figure out what can be done in such a scenario to ensure you do not end up losing out on your scholarship opportunity? When you did not reach out, it makes me feel as if you are not serious towards the scholarship program and you are okay with compromising on your career. Is that the case here?
30/1/24, 7:15 PM - +260 763785676: It is not the case
30/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Okay, Deborah, in that case, I would like to understand from you why did you not feel comfortable enough to take a step forward and discuss with the people who can help you out. Perhaps, by sharing your perspective, you can help me understand your situation better. <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 7:21 PM - +260 763785676: I didn't think we would go through this situation.
30/1/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Deborah, if you don't mind me asking, may I know what happened all of a sudden that prevented you from foreseeing the situation where you would risk your scholarship opportunity? Perhaps you can help me understand your situation, and I would be in a position to assist you with the way forward.

You have been one of my favorite students since you started your admission journey, and seeing you in such a situation disheartens me. I want to help you here, and to do that, you have to take the first step and give me better clarity on what transpired.
30/1/24, 7:27 PM - +260 763785676: Mom is not feeling well and she wasn't able to send the money today.
30/1/24, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am so sorry to know about your mom Deborah. May I know what happened to her and how is she feeling right now?
30/1/24, 7:31 PM - +260 763785676: She developed a terrible flu which made her feel weak and dizzy. But she is getting better now thank you for your concern.
30/1/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that she has been feeling better now. Godspeed to her @260763785676.
30/1/24, 7:45 PM - +260 763785676: Thank you.
30/1/24, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Also, addressing the concern you shared, I am a bit confused because earlier you mentioned that the money was not enough, and here you mentioned that your mother was not well, which is why she could not make the deposit. Can you please clarify again and help me understand your situation better so that I can guide you accordingly?
30/1/24, 7:48 PM - +260 763785676: She is not feeling well so she wasn't able to go for work. Which affected the amount of money to be sent.
30/1/24, 8:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Okay, Deborah. I understand, and thank you for the clarification. Since you mentioned that she was not able to secure the entire amount of money needed and she has been working for a while towards your education fee, I believe she must have been able to raise a part of the fee. May I know what is the amount she was able to secure by now for your university registration to help you secure your scholarship seat?
30/1/24, 8:26 PM - +260 763785676: I have to ask her. She hasn't really told me.
30/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Okay, Deborah. In that case, I would encourage you to have a discussion with her and then share an update with us. May I know by when would you be able to have a discussion with your mother and give us an update?
30/1/24, 8:29 PM - +260 763785676: Tomorrow.
30/1/24, 8:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Okay Deborah, In that case, I would be connecting with you tomorrow at 01:00 PM. In the meantime, I want you to have a discussion with your parents and I will do my best to present a compelling case on your behalf with the academic board and to ensure you do not lose out on the scholarship offered. To do that, I would need your assistance and specific information:

1. *Challenge/Concern Details:* Please share the specific challenges or concerns that led to missing the opportunity to secure the scholarship seat.

2. *Plans Moving Forward:* Outline your plans for moving forward in pursuing education abroad.

3. *How We Can Help:* Specify how you wish for us to assist you with the challenges you are facing.
30/1/24, 8:40 PM - +260 763785676: Is this needed today?
