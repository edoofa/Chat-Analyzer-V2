12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

12/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and thank you for your wishes. I am glad to hear that everyone is healthy in 2024. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

13/1/24, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday I wanted to reach out and know more about your A-level results. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 77 233 2043: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Greetings of the day Ms Kirti, I'm am sorry for the late responses which are due to network problems.
17/1/24, 8:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanyaradzwa.

I hope you are doing well. It is alright please, I understand that the network can be a challenge. Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 8:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
17/1/24, 8:34 AM - +263 77 233 2043: Good morning ma'am, how are you?

Thank you so much
17/1/24, 8:35 AM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, thank you for asking, I am doing great.

17/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 77 233 2043: Is it possible to change my program from Human resources to Geospatial intelligence program which I am currently interested in?
17/1/24, 9:33 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, it is possible to change your course and we shall have a in-depth discussion about the same on Monday.
17/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 233 2043: Thank you so much😊
25/1/24, 11:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Greetings Ms Kirti, I am glad you are better now
My family and I have been doing well.
25/1/24, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know that your family is doing well and thank you for your concern. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Yes I am available
25/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BBA for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
25/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Yes that is correct
25/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 233 2043: I do remember, thank you for the image
25/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
25/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Firstly, I get the message from the Founders of Edoofa on YouTube. I then write the Statement of Purpose, which already did. Thirdly, I go through Counseling Session on university Admissions. After this is done , I then receive offer letter from colleges or universities and choose the course I want to pursue. There is also university registration and admissions acceptance letter that I receive. Lastly there's Visa application process.
25/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 233 2043: I have no questions regarding the registration process.
25/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
25/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Yes we are very excited and can't wait for the offer letter.
25/1/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
25/1/24, 3:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $750. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 233 2043: We are not aware of the solution, please enlighten us.
25/1/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
25/1/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $750. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $375 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $375, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $375 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $375 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 233 2043: It's all clear thank you👏
25/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 233 2043: As of now we don't have any questions
25/1/24, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 233 2043: I'm so excited for the next steps
25/1/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Thank you so much Ms Kirti, have a great day ahead too.
30/1/24, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanyaradzwa,

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. I was going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 in the month of September 2023, however, there has been no record updated against the same. 

Considering this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Greetings Ms Kirti
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - +263 77 233 2043: We paid the Edoofa Enrollment fee

30/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see @263772332043, thank you for sharing the payment receipt with me. There is nothing to be worried about if you have made the payment. 

I have taken a note of the receipt, and I will share it with the accounts team as well for confirmation.
30/1/24, 6:21 PM - +263 77 233 2043: Thank you😊
