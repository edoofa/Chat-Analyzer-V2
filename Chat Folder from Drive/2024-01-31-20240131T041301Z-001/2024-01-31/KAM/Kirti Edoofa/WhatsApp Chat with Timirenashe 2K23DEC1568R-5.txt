29/12/23, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773902651 Alright please, you can update me about the same when you are connected with the school.

29/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We can proceed
29/12/23, 1:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/12/23, 1:08 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We can start
29/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Done
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 1:13 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Quite clear
29/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 1:18 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Following
29/12/23, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Oh ok so this is paid before coming to India?
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you are absolutely correct, as your counselor informed you in your counseling sessions. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Well explained
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thus fine
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Ready but network challenges now it's raining heavily

29/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 77 949 9509: <Media omitted>

29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
3/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

4/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 2. Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth, i.e. to provide plant habitat and result in sustained and consistent yields of high quality. It also refers to the soil's ability to supply plant/crop nutrients in the right quantities and qualities over a sustainable period of time.
4/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 949 9509: *Question*: How can soil fertility be improved?
*Answer*: Soil fertility can be further improved by incorporating cover crops that add organic matter to the soil, which leads to improved soil structure and promotes a healthy, fertile soil; by using green manure or growing legumes to fix nitrogen from the air through the process of biological nitrogen fixation; by micro-dose . . .

*Question*: How can we check the fertility of soil?
*Answer*: The measurement of the fertility of soils is usually done by chemical analysis for plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and trace elements, as well as physical measurements of soil structure.

5/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 3. There are two divisions of agriculture, subsistence and commercial farming which roughly correspond to the less developed and more developed countries. 
Contemporary practices subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and part of Asia and Latin America. Subsistence farmers farm for survival, and usually do not look to make a profit off the crops that they grow.
Commercial agriculture is practised virtually whenever it is capable of growing crops or raising livestock, but primarily in areas with the highest growth potential. It is usually found in more developed countries, and the crops are grown in huge quantities to support entire populations for a profit.
Subsistence farming, form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer's family, leaving little, if any surplus for sale or trade.
Commercial farming heps countries in the world earn a high foreign exchange. It is being purely for profit. It is also used for commercial use including cafeterias, restaurant and soup kitchen.
5/1/24, 9:58 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 4. Pesticides are substances that are used to control pests . They include herbicides, insecticides , nematicides, fungicides , and many others. The most common of these are herbicides, which account for approximately 50percent of all pesticides use globally.
Insecticides kill insects and other arthropods. Miticides also called acaricides kill mites that feed on plants and animals. Microbial pesticides are microorganisms that kill , inhibit , or out -compete pests , including insects or other microorganisms pests.
Molluscicides kill snails and slugs.
Pesticides are used in agriculture to control weeds , insect infestation and diseases . There are many different types of pesticides, each is meant to be effective against specific pests . 
Any harmful effects that occur from small doses repeated over a period time are termed chronic effects. Suspected chronic effects from exposure to certain pesticides include birth defects , toxicity to a fetus , production of benign or malignant tumours , genetic changes , blood disorders, nerve disorders, endocrine.
Some pesticides for example the organophosphates , can cause severe symptoms, like convulsious , coma and possibly even death.
5/1/24, 9:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the questions, however, since it is past our available time now let us reconnect tomorrow as we discussed above.
5/1/24, 9:59 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay
5/1/24, 10:40 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 5. Higher crop productivity . Decreased use of water , fertilizer, and pesticides which turn keeps food prices down . Reduced impact on natural ecosystems.
Furthermore, technologies offers precise recommendations on the use of fertilizers and pesticides, reducing input costs and minimising the environmental impact. For instance , using satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies, we can detect sub the cahnges in crop health and respond quickly to any emerging issues. Technology leads immense support in automating various tasks, setting up reminders , communicating effeciently , paying bills at the click of buttom and shopping for the simplest things such as groceries to investing in value assets right in the comfort of our homes.

8/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Afternoon

8/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted

8/1/24, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I will be waiting for your response, in the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion if you are available?
8/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay ma'am
8/1/24, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Agriculture) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the confirmation. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
8/1/24, 2:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22nd January 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay
8/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay thank you for the reminder ma'am
8/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, so I would like to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 949 9509: I paid
8/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 949 9509: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that it is duly noted with us.
8/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
8/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
8/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
8/1/24, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes I agree
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Notes
8/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Noted
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
8/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay ma'am
8/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Noted
8/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
8/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am we are on the same page
8/1/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
8/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Noted ma'am
8/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes I have
8/1/24, 3:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
8/1/24, 3:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
8/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Understood
8/1/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/1/24, 3:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/1/24, 3:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted visa and flight expenses may need to b enlightened on estimates or  current flight and visa fees to b well prepared
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy. The Visa fee will be $83.
8/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
8/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 77 949 9509: No queries
8/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
8/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
8/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 3:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward may I know if you were able to collect the statement of entry for A level or Letter of recommendation?
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Thank you ma'am
8/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 77 949 9509: I collected letter of recommendation
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please share the letter of recommendation.
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 949 9509: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter it is noted with us. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
8/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Inspiring
8/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Appreciated
8/1/24, 4:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I hope you are excited to be in this picture for the next year batch?
8/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
8/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
8/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 390 2651: A number of options to accommodate different categories of students, excellent
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Quite well
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
8/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Amazing
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/1/24, 4:31 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Understood
8/1/24, 4:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Provide more information
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Clear
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
8/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay ma'am
8/1/24, 5:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
8/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Yes
8/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
8/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
8/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Ok
8/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
8/1/24, 5:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
8/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted
8/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Understood
8/1/24, 5:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
8/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We do not wish for this
8/1/24, 5:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure this will not be the case. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 77 390 2651: No question so far
8/1/24, 5:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/1/24, 5:53 PM - +263 77 949 9509: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am I am excited
8/1/24, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
8/1/24, 6:01 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay ma'am thank you
14/1/24, 11:04 AM - +263 77 949 9509: Morning
15/1/24, 8:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Timirenashe.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
15/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 77 390 2651: Morning A level Results are out will share soon
15/1/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263773902651 We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students who expressed their joy upon receiving their A-Level results.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
15/1/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

15/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 77 390 2651: <Media omitted>

15/1/24, 9:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
15/1/24, 9:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
15/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted with thanks
16/1/24, 8:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Timirenashe,

24/1/24, 12:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Timirenashe,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was under the weather with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Sorry Mrs Kirti hope you are fine now

24/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted

24/1/24, 6:28 PM - +263 77 949 9509: We can continue with our discussion
24/1/24, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can continue with our discussion. Coming back to your concern that you shared above. Regarding your application, once we submit your results to the university, your application will be re-evaluated. As you have been granted the Endowment Plan benefit, we recommend completing the registration formalities now. If we submit your application for re-evaluation, you may lose the Endowment Benefit and the $100 grant due to the time taken by the university to evaluate your application. May I know if you are clear now?
24/1/24, 6:34 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes it's clear
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Clear so we should pay the 750 now, thought the university will communicate with us since we got the offer letter through your office
24/1/24, 6:37 PM - +263 77 390 2651: All the same since the banking details are there, we can pay.
24/1/24, 6:38 PM - +263 77 390 2651: But the university indicated the need to send A level results but from this side we can't so may your office send the results
24/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773902651 I appreciate your need for clarity, as we proceed with the discussion today we will even help you with the payment modes as well and regarding the A level results it is a general statement for all the students once you register yourself with the endowment benefits and reserve your seat we will share your results with the university as well so you do not have to worry about that, stay assured.
24/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you for clarity
24/1/24, 6:43 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay
24/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Yes payment modes please
24/1/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely we will get in the payment modes however, let us discuss the offer letter in detail so that you can have a better understanding of the same, so may I know if you are ready?
24/1/24, 6:49 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We are ready
24/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Tuition fee clear but the Programme BSC Agriculture is a 4 year not 3 years according to the offer letter
24/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error I have updated the same?
24/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Noted
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Okay
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
24/1/24, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
24/1/24, 7:07 PM - +263 77 390 2651: May you explain a bit the last option where are student can go independent on accommodation. The other 2 options are clear
24/1/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off- campus since it is cheaper compared to the on- campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off- campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.

I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
24/1/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
24/1/24, 7:11 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Well explained
24/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
24/1/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Well understood
24/1/24, 7:16 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thus a good approach
24/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Quite clear
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
24/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
24/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Great news indeed
24/1/24, 7:21 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Clear
24/1/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Yes please
24/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
24/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 29th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
24/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Waaal, what a good payment plan. Iam stress free
24/1/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 7:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 7:42 PM - +263 77 949 9509: In Masvingo not Harare
24/1/24, 7:43 PM - +263 77 390 2651: I reside in Masvingo but Harare we can do business there
24/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 7:45 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
24/1/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
24/1/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
24/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Mr Charles Jerera Account is the most convinient for us in Masvingo
24/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 77 390 2651: The account details we have
24/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, let me share the details with you again just for refernce. 

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
24/1/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
24/1/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Clear
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
24/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
24/1/24, 7:57 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Well understood and will encourage him to take advantage of this programme
24/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
24/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
24/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
24/1/24, 8:04 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Following well
24/1/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
24/1/24, 8:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/1/24, 8:06 PM - +263 77 390 2651: So far so good ma'am can move on
24/1/24, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
