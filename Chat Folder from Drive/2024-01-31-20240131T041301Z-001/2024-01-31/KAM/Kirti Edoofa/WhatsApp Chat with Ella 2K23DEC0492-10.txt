28/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
28/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
28/12/23, 6:41 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: <Media omitted>

I hope we are clear?
28/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion.

29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/12/23, 1:56 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am ready, we can start
29/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am done
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: They are all clear
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am following
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: They are all clear
29/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 2:09 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: We may proceed
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am ready
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

29/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I shall wait for your response.
29/12/23, 3:00 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Im done
29/12/23, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
29/12/23, 3:26 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: According to my understanding Edoofa has made it's students happy and independent, it has also advised on two intructions;
To be open-minded and to follow intructions.Apart from that Edoofa has garanteed on giving its students higher education and helping them achieve the lives of their dreams
29/12/23, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/12/23, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/12/23, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/12/23, 3:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

3/1/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As this group wants parents to be equally involved in the session. It is completely alright for you to continue with the session as well.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: We may proceed Ms kirti
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
3/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BBA for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
3/1/24, 3:22 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes Ms kirti
3/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Im ready
3/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
3/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
3/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
3/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes i agree
3/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
3/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
3/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes all this was discussed
3/1/24, 3:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
3/1/24, 4:17 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes we are Ms kirti
3/1/24, 4:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
3/1/24, 4:41 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Yes, we have noted the fees structure.
3/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
3/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
3/1/24, 5:18 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Well understood
3/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
3/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
3/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
3/1/24, 5:45 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: I am following
3/1/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 5:59 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Well understood you may proceed
3/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
3/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
3/1/24, 6:01 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Yes, my querry is on the payment period of within 2 weeks for registration fee & can't it be extended to me looks too short considering the 
how the economy is.
3/1/24, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
3/1/24, 6:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265999029331 thank you for saying your query. As we move ahead with the last step this query of yours shall be answered please do not worry.
3/1/24, 6:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/1/24, 6:07 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: We may proceed Ms kirti
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

*1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and JCE results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
5/1/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
5/1/24, 6:10 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes i understand
5/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
5/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
5/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
5/1/24, 6:17 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: You may proceed i understand quite well
5/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
5/1/24, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?

5/1/24, 6:20 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes it does
5/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
5/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
5/1/24, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I've followed and I understand
5/1/24, 7:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
5/1/24, 7:19 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: No i do not have any queries,Im good
5/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
5/1/24, 7:22 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: I am very excited Ms kirti and I can't wait
5/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
5/1/24, 7:29 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Thank you very much Ms kirti, May you also have a blessed day ahead

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
10/1/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 6:08 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 6:08 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Greeting too, we gone through the letter if you are ready to take our questions you will tell us.
10/1/24, 6:08 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: Good evening, this is Linley, Ella's mum. We are indeed so excited.
10/1/24, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 6:17 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: No problem with that arrangements, looking forward for the session.
10/1/24, 6:22 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Greetings Ms kirti
10/1/24, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
10/1/24, 6:53 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: 1. $900 per semester
2.the std course duration is 3 yrs
3.Its $300
4.registration fee is $750
10/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
10/1/24, 6:54 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Clear on that point
10/1/24, 6:57 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Admission fee is supposed to be paid within 15 days what about registration fee?
10/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265999029331 The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
10/1/24, 7:02 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted
10/1/24, 7:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
10/1/24, 7:03 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: I am following
10/1/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
10/1/24, 7:10 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Clear
10/1/24, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
10/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 24th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
10/1/24, 7:16 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Not clear on waver & registration fee
10/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265999029331 let me help you understand. The admission processing fee which is $300 is waived for you in particular because you have enrolled through edoofa and the admissions team of Edoofa has already taken care of that so this means you do not have to pay the $300 admission processing fee, may I know if you are clear now?
10/1/24, 7:19 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Very clear now
10/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 7:22 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Yes, explain please
10/1/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 24, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 24, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 24, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 7:26 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: It's clear
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: We can proceed
10/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted, we pay through the bank in this case eco bank where I will fill the forms & they will do the transaction. This is what we did when we were paying for enrollment fee. Though it takes a while becoz of shortage of forex our country is facing. Any development or stage you will be notified.
10/1/24, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that,  now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
10/1/24, 7:54 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
10/1/24, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
10/1/24, 7:58 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted
10/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
10/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
10/1/24, 7:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 8:01 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: It's clear & well eplained
10/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
10/1/24, 8:22 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Yes, most of the questions I had have been addressed but
1.There is a note about A level result does this apply to Ella, coz she wrote Malawi School Certificate of Education exams(,M.S.C.E,)?
2.At this stage should we expect more offers of university place apart from Galgotias?
3. How long are the holidays between semesters? & What will be happening to her?
4.Do you have any Malawians @ Galgotias university?
5. Is outside accomodations safe? How close are they from the campus? Does it need transport everyday?
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 8:27 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: To add to this, how far is Galgotias from New Delhi or how long does it take from New Delhi to reach Galgotias
10/1/24, 8:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.
10/1/24, 8:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me answer your queries one by one so that all the queries are addressed.
10/1/24, 9:19 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Yes you may
10/1/24, 9:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken note of your query and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
10/1/24, 9:36 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Good night too, see you tomorrow
11/1/24, 6:21 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: This message was deleted
11/1/24, 6:25 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Good evening @917292063289,  hope you are doing well
11/1/24, 6:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Ella,

I trust this message finds you well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and inquire if you're currently available to connect with us. This would allow us to continue our discussion as we had originally planned.
11/1/24, 6:29 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: We are available to continue with our conversation
11/1/24, 6:32 PM - +265 882 64 75 93: Good evening
11/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me help you with your queries one by one. Coming on to your first concern

Surely, let me help you understand better, you do not have to worry about it. What you are reading here in the offer letter is the standard statement for every student. So you do not have to worry about it, please.
11/1/24, 7:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear so far?
11/1/24, 7:38 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Clear
11/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now coming on your second query. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
11/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
11/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
11/1/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
11/1/24, 7:44 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: This is understood. But what will happen to the money paid after receiving offers from other universities?
11/1/24, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand even better. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
11/1/24, 7:48 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: Alright this is noted but you can elaborate on the transfer option
11/1/24, 7:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
11/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
11/1/24, 7:51 PM - +265 888 64 54 91: Yes, understood.
11/1/24, 7:53 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: We can proceed
11/1/24, 8:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming to your third and fifth concern the semester breaks are hardly a month and a half long. And mostly students stay at their accommodation and prefer to explore India and work hard on their EWYL projects to earn scholarship credits and learn new skills. So you do not have to worry about it.
11/1/24, 8:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off- campus since it is cheaper compared to the on- campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off- campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
11/1/24, 8:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
11/1/24, 8:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
11/1/24, 8:42 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: It's clear, we can proceed
11/1/24, 8:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are clear so far. Concerning your 4th concern yes multiple students are studying from Malwai through Edoofa in many universities and some include Galgotias as well so you do not have to worry about that it just that we can not share their details without their permission I hope you understand that someone privacy is important as well. However, you do not have to worry about it, when Ella arrives in India, she will be in contact with the batch that will arrive with her on the same date so stay rest assured about it.
11/1/24, 9:00 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Noted
11/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Coming to your last query, as we complete our discussion we will be sharing insights with you so be assured. New Delhi is hardly 30 minutes away from Metro.
11/1/24, 9:12 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Thanks for sparing your precious time to interact with us, it has been a productive conversation, we have learned a lot, I hope the door will be open Incase other questions pops up, my last issue on payment period for first instalment on registration fee, Is it possible to allow us to pay month end since our pay day is 25th every month. We can make sure to honor our payment after 25th but not later than 30th January 2024. Once we initiate the transaction with our local bank we will send you the details.
11/1/24, 9:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Thank you for letting me know that. Based on the insights you have provided, I now have a clearer understanding. While the university's due dates are significant for securing the scholarship seat, I acknowledge the validity of your concerns and as promised, I am here to help you with the same.
11/1/24, 9:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To address this, what I can do is, I can personally connect with the academic board and the university officials on your behalf and present a strong case for the concerns you have shared. My objective is to help you with a more flexible payment plan for Ella's university registration fee, ensuring that it aligns with your request so that you can secure the scholarship seat within the given timeframe.
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please correct me if I understood you wrong here. What you mean to say is that since you get your pay on the 25th of every month. Hence you want an extension of a day which is from 24th of Jan to 25th of Jan.

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 25, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 25, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if my understanding is correct here?
11/1/24, 9:27 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: Yes, that's correct
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I can connect with the team tomorrow and it can be done since you did share your concern with us in a timely manner. On that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay that is:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 25, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 25, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
11/1/24, 9:31 PM - +265 999 02 93 31: I will do as instructed, thanks
11/1/24, 9:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
