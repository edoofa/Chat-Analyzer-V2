I trust you're well and that you had a productive weekend. I'm following up regarding the fee breakdown I shared with you on Saturday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
30/1/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Pride,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. Over the past couple of days, I have been reaching out to you to discuss your offer letter from *Lovely Professional University*, which is ranked in the top 5 universities in India and top 80 universities globally. 

My intention is to help you understand the next steps for your university admission journey and guide you in the right direction. However, it seems as if my messages have not been able to get through.
30/1/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you recognize, the Edoofa scholarship opportunity is highly competitive, with students from all over the world vying for the scholarship and you have been given a valuable chance to shape your future path.
30/1/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If I know you well from our past discussions, this is not something you will lose out on easily. Hence, that is the reason, I am a bit worried because you have not connected with us over the past couple of days. I believe something must have been bothering you that has prevented you from connecting with us. Is my understanding correct?
