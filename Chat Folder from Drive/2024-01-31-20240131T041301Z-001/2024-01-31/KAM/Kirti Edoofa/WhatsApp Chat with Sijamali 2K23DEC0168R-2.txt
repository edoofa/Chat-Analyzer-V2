Am making a follow up if there has been a response from any university you sent Sijamali's application. 
It'd been a while and we have not heard from you regarding the same. 
Thank you.
5/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and SIjamali.

I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful New Year celebration thank you for your wish. I understand your concern here however, this is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
5/1/24, 7:21 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you for your response. 
More time indeed I need. 
You are absolutely right.
5/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a wonderful evening ahead!
5/1/24, 7:33 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you.  Stay blessed.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sijamali, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

17/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Sijamali,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
17/1/24, 8:21 PM - +260 97 6058891: Sorry I did not receive any message yesterday do you mind resending it
24/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sijamali,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence over the past week. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?
24/1/24, 9:00 PM - +260 97 6058891: Sorry for the late reply it's been a very busy day for me
24/1/24, 9:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I completely understand that you must be occupied, however, since my available hours for today are over for today let us plan to reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm CAT. I hope you will be available so that we can continue with our discussion have a blessed night ahead.
24/1/24, 9:43 PM - +260 97 6058891: Yes I will thank you very much
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sijamali.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 97 6058891: Yes we  may start
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  I trust you remember our last conversation, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted.
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the B.Tech (Civil Engineering) course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering)
25/1/24, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the B.Tech (Civil Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
25/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
25/1/24, 2:35 PM - +260 97 6058891: Thank you for all the effort put in by your team..yes you may share the solutions
25/1/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path. 

The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech Computer Science Engineering, which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
25/1/24, 2:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.

We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
25/1/24, 2:45 PM - +260 97 6058891: So you mean to say me majoring in computer science engineering in the first year will make up for the Chemistry A-levels that is in absence
25/1/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct.
25/1/24, 3:01 PM - +260 97 6058891: That sounds like an amazing
25/1/24, 3:02 PM - +260 97 6058891: Idea
25/1/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from Btech Civil Engineering to Btech Computer Science Engineering for the intake 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail once done please share the screenshot with us so that we can even update the university officials.
25/1/24, 3:16 PM - +260 97 6058891: No problem I will do so just let me consult with my mother but as she is currently not in the area can I send the screen shot later
25/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can, I shall wait for your update.
25/1/24, 3:30 PM - +260 97 6058891: Yes you may but i can't reach  currently
28/1/24, 2:55 PM - +260 97 6058891: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sijamali,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I have had a discussion with the academic board regarding your desired change in programs, and they have duly noted your decision. After deliberation, the academic board has accepted your request, and I am pleased to confirm that your course has been changed to the Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science Engineering.

We are confident that you will excel in this field and your scholarship application file, Sijamali 2K23DEC0168R, will be updated accordingly to reflect this change. I hope you have taken a note of this update? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 6:14 PM - +260 97 6058891: Wow thank you for the good news
30/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I was also going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 in the month of 11 January 2024, however, there has been no record updated against the same. 

Considering this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 10:45 PM - +260 97 6058891: Ooh I was not aware of the payment but it will be brought to my parents attention and the payment will be made
