I am fortunate to have a sponsor who plays a crucial role in my educational plans which is my Mom.

They have been a constant source of motivation and encouragement, ensuring that I have the necessary resources to pursue my educational goals.

I am truly grateful for the support and guidance I receive from my sponsor. Her belief in me has fueled my determination to excel academically and make the most of the opportunities presented to me.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
27/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Very clear
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Certainly! I’d be happy to share my experience with my counselor and the aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that have impressed me.

During my counseling session with my Edoofa counselor, I had the opportunity to discuss my educational goals, aspirations, and career interests. The counselor took the time to understand my background, strengths, and areas of improvement. They provided valuable guidance and advice on various programs and scholarship opportunities 

What impressed me the most about the counseling session was the personalized approach. The counselor took a genuine interest in understanding my individual needs and aspirations 
Additionally, the Edoofa Scholarship Program itself has left a lasting impression on me. The program offers a comprehensive package that goes beyond just financial assistance. It provides mentorship, career guidance, and internship opportunities to help students develop their skills and gain practical experience. This holistic approach to education is something that I find extremely valuable and unique.

Furthermore, Edoofa’s emphasis on creating a supportive community for students is commendable. The program connects students from diverse backgrounds, allowing them to learn from each other, share experiences, and build a strong network. This sense of belonging and support is crucial in ensuring the overall growth and success of students.

Overall, the counseling session with my Edoofa counselor and the various aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have impressed me greatly. The personalized guidance, comprehensive support, and focus on community-building make it a standout program for students like me who are looking for not just financial assistance but also holistic development opportunities.

I have known Mr. Shashwat for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track. It sounds like the counseling session was particularly impactful, offering you a personalized and thorough discussion about your educational aspirations and career goals.

27/12/23, 3:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
27/12/23, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Done ✅
27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +263 77 364 3205: That sound clear
27/12/23, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:36 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah sure
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Its very clear
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Oky then
27/12/23, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

28/12/23, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tinotenda,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we can
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
28/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 77 364 3205: From the first video I have learned that students are required to be teachable, and open minded and they’re recommended to follow all Edoofa’s instructions and so on .2nd and third videos they said Edoofa helps students with affordable quality education making them employable and they .they also have a plenty number of schools and colleges they’re connected to giving an example of why they had to choose the best schools or institute. Then from the fourth video they enlighten me about the statement of purpose SOP every student is given an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment,skills to convince the board of different schools for them to get scholarships. It is a very important document which a student should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out. Edoofa invested 10 years for the best of Edoofians
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 364 3205: That’s true thank you for making me understand more
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of NAME’S university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in NAME’S admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
28/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we’re going well
28/12/23, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
28/12/23, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

Electronics focuses on electronic devices and circuits, while electrical systems deal with the infrastructure and equipment used to generate and distribute electricity. 

Electronics encompasses a wide range of applications, including communication systems ,computers, consumer electronics and automation systems,It involves the use of electronic components such as diodes,resistors,capacitors and inductors to process and transmit information.Whilst Electrical systems encompasses power generation plants, power grids, substations,transformers, and  other equipment used to produce and distribute electrical energy . They also involves the generation, transmission ,distributions and utilization of electricity.
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 77 364 3205: 5. A capacitor is an electronic device used to store and release electrical energy. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, one plate accumulates positive charges while the other accumulates negative charges.

The working principle of a capacitor is based on the concept of capacitance, which is the ability of a system to store an electric charge. The capacitance value of a capacitor determines its ability to store charge for a given voltage. It is directly proportional to the surface area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field is created in the dielectric material. This field causes the electrons in one plate to be pushed away, leaving a positive charge. Simultaneously, the electrons from the other plate are attracted towards the positive charge, creating a negative charge. This separation of charges creates an electric potential difference or voltage across the capacitor.

The capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field between the plates. When connected to a circuit, it can release this stored energy back into the circuit.
29/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Done ☑️
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 77 364 3205: It was July
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay
29/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay thank you
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 the academic year in India commences in the month of August only every year.
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Oky it’s fine
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes am ready
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 6:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Indeed its impossible
29/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes she did
29/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Following
29/12/23, 6:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we’re
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Ohh okay
29/12/23, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Oky noted
29/12/23, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 8:45 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I don’t any so far
29/12/23, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we’re hope I we found you well
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. So may I know if you are ready to start with the discussion?
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes I am
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
2/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Done ☑️
2/1/24, 4:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 4:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I’m following
2/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes it does
2/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah sure
2/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I don’t have any for now
2/1/24, 5:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah enlight me more about the costs
2/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 may I know which costs are you referring to now, since I have explained all the costs above and here I mean to ask if you have any more concerns?
2/1/24, 6:24 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Sorry so you’re saying if the fees hikes by 30% it doesn’t affect me?
2/1/24, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 yes please, that is true through the Endowment Plan, you have this as an added benefit.
2/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay I get it
2/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes indeed I am
2/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
2/1/24, 7:26 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay thank you for your time
15/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group Institute* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
15/1/24, 9:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:30 PM to 03:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐

16/1/24, 8:10 AM - +263 77 364 3205: 1:30pm will be fine
16/1/24, 8:11 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Thanks
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Sure ,afternoon how are you
16/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes  I have gone through
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
16/1/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 77 364 3205: 1. $1225
2. 1200
3. $750
16/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Really?
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 Yes please. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
16/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yeah but as for accommodation,
16/1/24, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 may I know what concerns do you have regarding the accommodation?
16/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 77 364 3205: my friends are off campus eg Lyona, Rufaro, Vanessa, Agatha & Mitchell
16/1/24, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 it is good to know that you are connected with your friends and I appreciate you sharing the same with me. However, maybe your friends might not be offered a scholarship from a different university and you are being offered a scholarship from one of the best universities. On that note if you do not mind me asking, could you please share the name of the university your friends are at?
16/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Ohh ok as for the names i dont know
16/1/24, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 it is alright please, even you can opt for off-campus from your second year once you are quite familiar with the environment because here even the university is looking after your safety as a student and every university has its own policies, right?
16/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 77 364 3205: It’s CT and LPU
16/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Ohh Oky
16/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. With that said, I can understand that you wish to stay with your friends, specifically LPU and CT University, however, we are associated with LPU University and we have already shared your application with the university and we are expecting responses from them. However, considering that LPU is one of the best universities and therefore the cost of education is also high there, as per the updates we received from the counseling team, they shared insights with us that you are looking for a higher quantum of scholarship at an affordable cost.
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: At Gulzar you are being offered safety, if you are not considering your quality of education for now and are more focused on Freedom in that case, I believe you are not focused on the quality of education offered because at Gulzar you are being offered on campus accommodation at an affordable cost which includes your food, basic water charges, electricity charges, and the Wifi charge.
16/1/24, 4:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now let me help you explain why we are not partners with CT University. I understand that since you are not physically present here and since you have limited knowledge about the universities here in India, you do believe in the information that you get on the internet. But, since we have been in the Indian Education sector for more than a decade now, we do have strong connections with the education ministry and organizations all over India due to which we know all about the universities here in India.
16/1/24, 4:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us first discuss about CT University. Since you have mentioned its name, I believe you were not aware of the fact that CT University is not among the institutions listed in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, and due to the same reason any degree completed by the students at CT University is not recognized. Were you aware of this?
16/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay i get it
17/1/24, 10:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday. I have scheduled our discussion for today at 01:30 pm so let us reconnect at the same time, I hope you will be available.
17/1/24, 10:22 AM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay thank you
17/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes I’m how are you
17/1/24, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are ready to start with your discussion?
17/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes I’m ready
17/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you were able to go through this message above?
17/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
17/1/24, 2:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you were aware that the CT university is not recognized by National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)?
17/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I wasn’t aware though
17/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussion however, for now, I will not be available to connect since I am heading for my dinner break, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm CAT so that we can continue with our discussion without any issues, have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
17/1/24, 4:48 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay then thanks
24/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 5:15 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Am well okay n that side ?
24/1/24, 9:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better. I would love to continue with our conversation however, given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
24/1/24, 10:24 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I will try to connect
25/1/24, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 6:56 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we can
25/1/24, 7:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
25/1/24, 7:06 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes I am
25/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you? <This message was edited>
25/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we are
25/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education
25/1/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
25/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes it is
25/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2425. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2425 - $1000 = $1425, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
25/1/24, 7:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
25/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes it does
25/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
25/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837 and $838, with a six-month gap between them.
25/1/24, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
25/1/24, 8:11 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
25/1/24, 8:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
25/1/24, 8:29 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I understand but can’t you atleast postponed my registration fee with a month or two?
25/1/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205 we can certainly have a discussion about it. However, if we do that then In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Those endowment benefits will not be available for you. 

 Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
25/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
25/1/24, 8:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/1/24, 8:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before January 29th, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes we’re
25/1/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/1/24, 9:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/1/24, 11:05 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
26/1/24, 12:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to complete our letter discussion yesterday let us plan to connect today at 06:00 pm CAT, so I can help you understand the offer letter better. I hope you will be available.
26/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I will try to connect with you
26/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes I am
26/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
26/1/24, 7:36 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
26/1/24, 7:39 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Bt my network is crapping
26/1/24, 8:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please may I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the discussion now?
26/1/24, 8:14 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
26/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
26/1/24, 8:26 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
26/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
26/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay
26/1/24, 8:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
26/1/24, 8:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
26/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Yes you can
26/1/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do so.

30/1/24, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda,

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. I am pleased to learn that you were able to make the payment of your registration fee by now. Could you please share the payment receipt with us so that we can update the accounts team and inform the university officials accordingly?
30/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 77 364 3205: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, @263773643205. I have taken note of the same and will update the accounts team and the university officials for payment confirmation. However, I noticed that you made a payment of $650 instead of $731. It seems you are yet to make the payment of the balance amount of $81 for the International Transfer Charges?
30/1/24, 3:55 PM - +263 77 364 3205: I only paid according to what you said
30/1/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @263773643205
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263773643205, I mentioned that amount that is due without factoring in the international transfer charges of 12.5%. I believe I must have misinterpreted your question and if that is the case, please excuse me for the same.
30/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Okay then i will compensate
30/1/24, 5:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and thank you for sharing this update with me @263773643205. I was also going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 by the 26th of January 2024.

Considering the same, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Not yet ,I forgot about it
30/1/24, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is alright @263773643205. In that case, I believe you would be making the payment of remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee of $150 along with the balance transfer charges?
30/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 77 364 3205: To make it ?
30/1/24, 7:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205, I did not get you well. Are you asking about the total amount of fee that you need to deposit?
30/1/24, 7:34 PM - +263 77 364 3205: Sure
30/1/24, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773643205, for the payment of the enrollment fee of $150, the transfer charges will be $19, making the total amount $169. When you add this to the registration fee of $71, the total amount you need to deposit becomes $240. I hope this is clear to you?
31/1/24, 2:00 AM - +263 77 364 3205: No the remaining of the previous amount charges were included there so as for the previous
