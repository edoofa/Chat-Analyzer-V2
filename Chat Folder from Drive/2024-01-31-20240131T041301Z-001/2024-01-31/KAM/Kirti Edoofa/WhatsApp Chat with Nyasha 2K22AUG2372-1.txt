24/1/24, 1:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha,

I trust you're all having a good day. I want to start by apologizing for my absence. Unfortunately, I was unwell with a severe ENT infection, which required me to rest as per my doctor's advice. Thankfully, I'm feeling much improved now and am eager to reconnect with you so we can continue our discussions. But before we proceed, I'm curious to hear about how your last week went?

I'm so sorry, please get well soonest.

24/1/24, 5:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better today, and thank you for your wishes. If we look at the positive side we can say that you had a very productive week and it is good to know that you are doing good now.
25/1/24, 5:38 AM - +263 71 298 2024: yes ma'am
25/1/24, 5:38 AM - +263 71 298 2024: Good morning
25/1/24, 12:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
25/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 298 2024: hello ma'am
25/1/24, 12:36 PM - +263 71 298 2024: yes I'm available
25/1/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/1/24, 12:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know If you are clear so far?
25/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 298 2024: yes ma'am,
25/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 71 298 2024: I did understand!  thank you for clarification
25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/1/24, 12:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 71 298 2024: can you explain this is simpler English?
25/1/24, 12:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely I will try my best to explain the same to you in layman's terms. After you receive the offer letter from the university. it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600. In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once you register yourself with the university by completing the payment of $600 the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. 

May I know if you are clear now?
25/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 298 2024: the 150 is the money I paid to get enrolled?
25/1/24, 12:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263712982024 $150 is the grant you will be receiving from Edoofa you will have to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the university.
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 298 2024: oh, I see this is amazing
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you Edoofa
25/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/1/24, 12:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $750, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $300 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 298 2024: this is nice ma'am
25/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you for sharing such exciting news
25/1/24, 12:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you, let me ask!

is it possible for you to give me an estimate amount of money I will be paying per year for the program?
25/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 298 2024: and maybe you can tell what we are supposed to bring over there?
25/1/24, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263712982024 the entire cost of education will be within the same range as you were told earlier which is $2000-$3000 and stay assured once you get your offer letter everything will be mentioned to you so please do not worry.
25/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you ma'am
25/1/24, 8:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 71 298 2024: yes, let me ask ma'am.

prolly, how much is needed for the visa, airticket and amount to be paid to the university when i come in August?
25/1/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The average flight ticket will cost from $400-$500 and the visa fee will be $83. @263712982024 since your cost of education varies from $2000-$3000 let me help you understand with an example.
25/1/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
25/1/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
25/1/24, 8:54 PM - +263 71 298 2024: ooh I see, so basically, am I supposed to pay the fee in monthly installments in other years?
25/1/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 71 298 2024: I see, I understand
25/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 71 298 2024: yes, yes.
25/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you ma'am
25/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 298 2024: Good night
25/1/24, 10:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, while I was going through your application file I noticed that you have not shared your O level results with us please share the same by tomorrow morning.
25/1/24, 10:33 PM - +263 71 298 2024: ooh, I'm so sorry ma'am. 
let me check them or I would have to collect the slip on Wednesday. 
I haven't collected because I am not around.
25/1/24, 10:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, you can share the slip by Wednesday we will share your application by then.
26/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 298 2024: thank you
30/1/24, 5:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha,

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. I was going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 in the month of September 2022, however, there has been no record updated against the same. 

Considering this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
30/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 71 298 2024: last time, if I heard you correctly, I was told the fee can be paid even when I reach to India.
30/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 71 298 2024: how much did I pay?
30/1/24, 5:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No @263712982024🏅, I think there might be a misunderstanding here. The remaining Edoofa Enrollment Fee needs to be paid before your arrival in India. This ensures that all your enrollment formalities can be completed smoothly, allowing you to benefit from the admission facilities and the visa application process without any delays.

Your Edoofa Enrollment Fee was $350, out of which you've already paid $200. This leaves a balance of $150 and hence I wanted to reach out and understand if you have been able to make the payment of the same fee by now? If not, by when do you believe you would be able to deposit the fee so that I can alert the academic board?
30/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 71 298 2024: okay let me work it out and see
30/1/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @263712982024, that would be absolutely fine. Please take your time and have a discussion with your family and let us know about the same so that we can update the academic board as well. If I may ask, may I know by when would you be able to give us an update so that we can reconnect with each other accordingly?
30/1/24, 8:36 PM - +263 71 298 2024: yes, let me work and get the money sent to you
