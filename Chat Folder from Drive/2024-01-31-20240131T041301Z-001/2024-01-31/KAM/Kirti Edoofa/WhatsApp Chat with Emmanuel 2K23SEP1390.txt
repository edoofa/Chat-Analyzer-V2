I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of sports. I was going through your scholarship application file today and I noticed that you were supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee of $150 in the month of October 2023, however, there has been no record updated against the same. 

Considering this, I wanted to reach out to you, share a gentle reminder, and try to understand if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now so that we can update the academic board accordingly?
