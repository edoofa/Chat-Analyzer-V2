On the 3rd question it is $0 because of the 100 percent offered on accomodations
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - +260 765306528: When does the 15 days count down start?
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - +260 765306528: Thanks .
10/1/24, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 6:56 PM - +260 765306528: Yes I do
10/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - +260 765306528: Yes it is
10/1/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
10/1/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
10/1/24, 7:01 PM - +260 765306528: Yes it is
10/1/24, 7:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
10/1/24, 7:02 PM - +260 765306528: Oh alright
10/1/24, 7:02 PM - +260 765306528: What about the transportation fee from here?
10/1/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260765306528 I appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.
10/1/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.

As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
10/1/24, 7:04 PM - +260 765306528: Proceed.
10/1/24, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 7:05 PM - +260 765306528: We can proceed.
10/1/24, 7:06 PM - +260 765306528: I understand it
10/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
10/1/24, 7:08 PM - +260 765306528: Yes it is
10/1/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
10/1/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
10/1/24, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 7:11 PM - +260 765306528: Yes I understand this
10/1/24, 7:12 PM - +260 765306528: I already started submitting offline applications to you........With no response...........Is that how it works?
10/1/24, 7:14 PM - +260 96 6408899: Thank you ...i followed the whole conversation i think our worries have been lifted its really gering better.
10/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, your activeness and data are always recorded in our records.
10/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
10/1/24, 7:17 PM - +260 765306528: Thanks
10/1/24, 7:18 PM - +260 765306528: Crystal clear
10/1/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
10/1/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
10/1/24, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
10/1/24, 7:22 PM - +260 96 6408899: yes thanks
10/1/24, 7:23 PM - +260 96 6408899: yes it does
10/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
10/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
10/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
10/1/24, 7:28 PM - +260 96 6408899: yes i do agree with you but would have loved to have choice s
10/1/24, 7:31 PM - +260 765306528: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
10/1/24, 7:43 PM - +260 96 6408899: it is very clear thanks
10/1/24, 7:45 PM - +260 96 6408899: for now i will wait for   my husband to go through our discussion incase he has something to say ..i know he is working late today that is why is offline
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - +260 765306528: Yed
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - +260 765306528: Yes*
10/1/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 7:47 PM - +260 765306528: No
10/1/24, 7:48 PM - +260 96 6408899: no i didn't know
10/1/24, 7:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
10/1/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
10/1/24, 7:53 PM - +260 765306528: Clear
10/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
10/1/24, 8:01 PM - +260 96 6408899: noted thanks 🙏
10/1/24, 8:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 20, 2024*.
10/1/24, 8:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 8:06 PM - +260 96 6408899: yes please explain
10/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 20, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 20, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 20th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 8:09 PM - +260 765306528: Clear
10/1/24, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 10% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well? <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 8:12 PM - +260 765306528: So meaning the deposit amount would be higher????????? Because the agents who usually help with depositting the Edoofa money raise the prices and they differ from what you tell us

10/1/24, 8:26 PM - +260 96 6408899: am with the idea that we use the bank tranfer direct to the indian account if the banks will accept the transfer just as we do wen sending the money to other countries  thus because agents  charge makes the whole  process go up unnecesarily.. for instance when we deposited the K350  the first payment we were asked additional 5% barely 4 weeks down the line they increased to 10% hence its better we pay bank tranfer charges than through agents unless we fail ...then we can came back to you for help.
10/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that if you wish to pay through a direct bank transfer it is completely alright please the details have been mentioned in the offer letter, you can surely do that.

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
13/1/24, 10:21 AM - +260 765306528: Good morning
13/1/24, 10:22 AM - +260 765306528: We did discuss on it actually. And we opted to wait for other offer letters from other universities as we are still doing research on MVN
13/1/24, 10:25 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
13/1/24, 10:29 AM - +260 765306528: According to our research, it's a good university that offers great educational facilities and other activities outside school. We also checked it's ranking in India and it's on number 81137 if I'm not mistaken
13/1/24, 10:29 AM - +260 765306528: Their infrastructure is very clean and conducive for a learner like me
13/1/24, 10:30 AM - +260 765306528: So far we have not seen any negatives concerning it. But we just want to be open to other universities so that we can know which one would suit us best

13/1/24, 10:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching MVN University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
13/1/24, 10:49 AM - Kirti Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns regarding the rankings were highlighted.
13/1/24, 10:51 AM - +260 96 6408899: Good morning.... Will definitely come back to you before due date for MVN as we wait for others
13/1/24, 12:19 PM - +260 765306528: Is that so?
13/1/24, 1:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I just came to inform you that I would like to reschedule our discussion for Monday. I hope this works for you and that you'll be available to connect on Monday. Thank you for your understanding.

24/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Grace,

I hope this message finds you all well and in high spirits. I apologize for not being in touch over the past few days. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a significant ENT infection and needed to follow my doctor's recommendation for rest, which meant taking some time off to prioritize my health. As a result, I was unable to inform you about my temporary absence. Thankfully, I'm feeling considerably better now and am ready to resume our interactions. Before we proceed with our discussion, I'd like to catch up - how have you and your family been lately?
24/1/24, 5:37 PM - +260 765306528: Good to hear that you are now fine. We hope you are keeping up well. We are all doing very fine and we're patiently waiting for your updates
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes, I am doing better now. Since we were unable to connect previously so let us plan to connect tomorrow at 02:00 pm CAT so that we can go through any queries that you still have. I hope you will be available tomorrow have a blessed day ahead.
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +260 96 6408899: This message was deleted
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - +260 96 6408899: we thank God you're getting better now ...otherwise we are well here ..nice to hear from you
26/1/24, 2:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Grace.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to move further with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can continue with our discussion?
26/1/24, 2:53 PM - +260 765306528: Yes we may
26/1/24, 3:34 PM - +260 96 6408899: Sorry was engaged...yes we can move now
26/1/24, 3:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now coming back to your concern regarding the MVN University what I am unable to understand exactly is your concern pertaining that?
26/1/24, 3:39 PM - +260 765306528: We were all confortable with the university. We just opted to see more options
26/1/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260765306528 I completely understand that however, I am pretty sure you are aware of the transfer option so I would like to understand why do you wish to wait for other options when you have the transfer option available?
26/1/24, 4:18 PM - +260 765306528: Maybe they didn't have money at that time. Not so sure
26/1/24, 4:19 PM - +260 765306528: But we were going to settle for it
26/1/24, 4:25 PM - +260 96 6408899: Allow me to discuss it further with the Father this even he is going to be home from a another town will come back to you since we cant see other options
26/1/24, 4:27 PM - +260 96 6408899: Congratulations to Grace for making it. The tesults are out will be sending you a copy once we have it downloaded
26/1/24, 4:42 PM - +260 765306528: Thanks
26/1/24, 4:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I will surely wait for you to share the results.
26/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please if you do not wish to reserve your seat with MVN University we completely respect your decision, however, as per the counseling team your application was shared for the higher quantum of scholarship if you wish to wait for more offers you can surely do that but if those offers do not align your preference or you may consider that the amount asked might be expensive then please remember you would have even lost this opportunity, and that is the reason I would want you to think first make use of the transfer option and then select. If I were at your place I would keep two options open for myself rather than just waiting for the one.
26/1/24, 5:09 PM - +260 96 6408899: We appreciate
26/1/24, 5:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when can I expect an update from you regarding your decision?
26/1/24, 5:20 PM - +260 96 6408899: Monday is better
26/1/24, 5:41 PM - +260 765306528: The MVN offer is still available?
26/1/24, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. I completely understand that my absence affected the process however, my health was also my priority at that time, and that is why I have discussed with the academic board to grant an extension till the 31st of January which is exactly when the university closes the round of applications for this month. Because I did not want my absence to affect you reserving your seat.
26/1/24, 7:05 PM - +260 765306528: That's awesome then we'll discuss at length
26/1/24, 7:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can update me by Monday.
26/1/24, 7:06 PM - +260 765306528: Alright I will
