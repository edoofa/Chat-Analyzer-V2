I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
16/1/24, 12:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their MSCE results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your MSCE results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your MSCE results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
26/1/24, 7:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and David.

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Kirti, admissions officer here at Edoofa. As we step at the end of the month. I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that you have an upcoming deadline for your university registration fee. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount by now?
30/1/24, 8:08 AM - +265 993 58 12 14: Good morning from here.  I have been following. Welcome Mr Kirti, two issues first. The moving out of Mr Milan was unceremoniously  done, just after paying registration fees, he disappeared and he didn't say a word and yet before payment we were communicating on a daily basis,  he should have at least said something- bye. To any person his can easily raise eye brows. Secondly,  our national bank in Malawi had requested an introductory letter between Edoofa and Galgatoris university but there has been no response until he left, did he explain or handover anything? Because we already had paid what you are asking. Please check the records because we had even paid reservation seat . Please I need to understand all this so that we can be on the same page. Wholeheartedly,  I would like to sincerely thank for following up on the matter otherwise we were lost. Have a blessed day
