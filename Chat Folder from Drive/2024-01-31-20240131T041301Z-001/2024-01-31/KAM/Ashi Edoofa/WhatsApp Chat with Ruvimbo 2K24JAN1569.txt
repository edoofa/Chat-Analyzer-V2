25/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

25/1/24, 6:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
25/1/24, 6:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions.

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

26/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 062 8834: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am waiting for your response dear
26/1/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 252 1604: She's working on them (typing).
26/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I will be waiting for her response
26/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Question2: Business Process Management life cycle is a procedure which involves stages from process identification, design, implementation ,monitoring and optimisation.It is iterative and allows continuous improvement of organisations to adapt to changes .Stages involved are Design, modeling, execution, monitoring and optimisation. 
 Design is the first stage which involves identifying and mapping out existing processes and establishing new processes and defining what business value it will deliver to meet organisation goals .

The second phase which is modeling focuses on setting objectives and determining a course of action for achieving these objectives, also involves use of graphical representations to understand and communicate the workflow.

The third phase which is execution involves the implementation of a strategic process in an effort to reach business goals and objectives .It involves the use of Business Process Management software to execute operations .

The fourth phase is monitoring.It includes reviewing and analyzing the performance of the processes to identify problems and success.  Monitoring could focus on either a single or more extensive project.

The fifth stage is optimisation .This include increasing organisational efficiency by improving and expediting the process .

These phases stated above build on the previous one hence mostly result in an efficient and effective business process.
Notably these phases are significant as they lead to a greater agility ,tighter process controls ,reduced costs and risks as well as better customer engagement.
26/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Question 3:Business plays a pivotal role in the success and growth of an organisation across various industries .Enterprises curb unemployment by provision of job opportunities to both skilled and unskilled labourers .Through provision of goods and services ,businesses stimulate consumer spending and drive demand which leads to increased economic output and the overall gross domestic product of a country.Enterprises pay tax to that can be used by local government in building schools and hospitals thus improving standards of living.Businesses generate profits leading to increased income and wealth of enterprenuers in the economy .Market competition is another significance of businesses as a health competition amongst businesses encourages efficiency and innovation.For instance small to medium enterprises in Zimbabwe generate an amount of 60% of the gross domestic product and more than half of employment is provided to livelihoods in the workforce.
Infrastructure development is also achieved by existence of emerging firms
26/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Question4:
What I encountered during my period as the senior headgirl of Marange High School and as well as the team captain of volleyball made me realize that being a leader comes through with many challenges .I learnt the importance of effective communication in management.Coordination and communication reduce the risk of misunderstandings and conflicts amongst people in an organisation .Enforcing discipline is also a major factor I learnt .This came about through upholding school rules and promoting a culture of respect and responsibility among students .
Being initiative,thus taking a lead in projects and contributing to the schools development is also one of the major factor I encountered which is needed for someone to have managerial skills.
As the captain in volleyball I could see the importance of time management as it ensured optimal use of available resources and time.To cloud it all as a leader or manager one should be able to lead by example .As the captain ,senior headgirl and manageress ,I had to set a  standard of performance and behaviour serving as a role model for dedication
26/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Question 5:The human resource department in an organisation facilitates a positive employee experience hence altering organisational outperformance .This department helps in recruiting and retaining high quality and multi skilled employees that makes a business more effective.Skilled employees expedite business processes and contribute a sixth sense on what is to be implemented in the firm for it to be lucrative.Human resource ensures the organisation. adheres to all federal and local labour laws that favour employees and this gives a sense of motivation .The department also looks at wages and salaries of workers which is necessary as they are financial motivators .Also employees feel safe ,valued and properly supported hence are determined to perform well .
26/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22nd February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 252 1604: For the enrolment fee $350 I did a once off payment.
26/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263772521604 <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 062 8834: yes the information is accurate
26/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 78 062 8834: yes I understand it's not possible
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 062 8834: so I'll chose one
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 062 8834: Yes Mr Kunal made it very clear to me
26/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 252 1604: In the acceptance lettet, thete is a clause which states that 'upon securing the scholarship lettet of intent, a registration/ admission processing fee of $500=$1000 will be charged'. Is this the ond you're talking about because we haven't receive the scholarship letter of intent yet?
26/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263772521604, You are correct. You will soon receive the offer letter
26/1/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 78 062 8834: well understood
26/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1000 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $800 per annum
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $200 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
26/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 062 8834: noted
26/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
26/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650  - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 062 8834: noted
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ruvimbo , I hope you are doing well!
27/1/24, 10:38 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
27/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 062 8834: good morning
27/1/24, 10:39 AM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm ready
27/1/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 78 062 8834: i have understood that very well.We can proceed .
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/1/24, 10:42 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 78 062 8834: this is nice
27/1/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/1/24, 10:45 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
27/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm ready to know.I'm more than excited
27/1/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
27/1/24, 10:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. <This message was edited>
27/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 062 8834: yes sure.
27/1/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
27/1/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/1/24, 10:56 AM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 78 062 8834: what if one fails to meet the deadlines?
27/1/24, 11:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780628834 If the students fails to meet the deadline, they will lose the scholarship opportunity at that particular university
27/1/24, 11:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 062 8834: okay
27/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 062 8834: no queries yet
27/1/24, 11:08 AM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/1/24, 11:12 AM - +263 78 062 8834: I'm really excited sir
27/1/24, 11:12 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
