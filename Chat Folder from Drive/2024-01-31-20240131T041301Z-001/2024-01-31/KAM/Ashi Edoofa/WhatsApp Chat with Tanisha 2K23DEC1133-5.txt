26/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
26/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/12/23, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
26/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes they're clear
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/12/23, 4:39 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

26/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

26/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Tanisha, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
26/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
26/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i do agree
26/12/23, 6:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes we are on the same page
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
26/12/23, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
26/12/23, 6:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
26/12/23, 6:46 PM - +263 71 783 8694: 12:30pm to 8:30pm is okay
26/12/23, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the task. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

27/12/23, 12:13 PM - +263 71 783 8694: 2. IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A SOCIAL STRUCTURE THAT CONSTRAINTS INDIVIDUAL ACTION OR IS SOCIETY NOTHING MOTE THAN A FIGMENT OF OUR NAVIGATIONS 

Social structure does not exist and it can indeed constrain individual action  .Social structure refers to a patterned social arrangement  that form society including institutions,organisations and norms .These structures can influence and limit individual behaviour through expactations , roles and regulations .However society is not just a figment of our imaginations. It is a complex and dynamic system that shapes and is shaped by individual collective actions. The interplay between social structure and individual agency is a key focus of sociogical inquiry.Even if someone were to live in complete isolation,they would still be influenced by the social environment  they were raised in.They would have learned language ,customs and beliefs from their parents or caregivers .They would have internalized social norms and values that would shape their behaviour and attitudes .Furthermore human existance is not just about survival .It is also about finding meaning and purpose in life

3.PLEASE EXPLAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN SOCIOLOGY AND ECONOMICS 
Sociology deals with the relationship between humans and society.Ecomics is an age -old institution used to deal with the changing pattern in society.Ecomics helps to understand the pattern of wants and consumptions of resources  .The focus of study in sociology and the behaviour of human in society.Sociology and Economics as social sciences have close relations .Relationship between the two is so close that one is often treated as the branch of the other because society is greatly influenced by economic factors and economic  processes are largely determined by the environment of the society .Economics deals with the economic activities of man .lt deals with production consumption and distribution of wealth.The economic factors play a vital role in every aspect of our social life. Total development of individual depends very much on economic factors.Without economic conditions the studyof societyis quite impossible. Sociology focuseson the organisation of social relationship and makes an effort to analyse the dynamicsof organised patterns of social relations and social behaviour. 

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS  IN SOCIETY. DO THEY PERFORM POSITIVE FUNCTIONS OR SIMPLY WORK IN THE INTEREST OF THE POWERFUL AND AGNAIST THEPOWERLESS? ELABORATE WITH EXAMPLES
Institutions are a part  of social order of society and they govern behaviour and expactations of individuals while atvthe same time they regulate bussiness operations and ethics .Infact the morality of institutions is guaranteed, the process of social evolution .The role of the institutions in society is complex and multifaceted. While some institutions may perform positive functions such as mantaining social order  providing essential services and promoting  collective well being others may indeed work  in the interests of the powerful and agnaist the powerless .Institutions are part of the social  construcion of a community and define the way we interact with each other .They are determined by cultures and values  of that society , provide order and stability within society.

EXPLAIN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GROUPS AS THE SOCIOLOGICAL GROUPS AND ELABORATE WITH EXAMPLE ABOUT IN GROUPS AND OUT -GROUPS AS SUBTYPES  OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GROUPS 
Primary group is usually made of significant others,those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization. The best example of primary group is a family .Secondary groups can be understood to be ones in which individuals exchange explict commodities for example  labour for wages , services for payments .Examples of out grops are non-religious neighbours next door to a religious  community centre(the neighbours are not members of religious community). An in- group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to .A gruop that we do not belong to .An out- group is a group that we view  fundamentally different from us .For example if you are a female your gender in - group include all females and your gender out- groul includes all males
27/12/23, 12:16 PM - +263 71 783 8694: The above message is for BA Sociology Interview Questions
27/12/23, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanisha, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
27/12/23, 12:18 PM - +263 71 783 8694: How are you Ms Ashi
27/12/23, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024).
27/12/23, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/C9ZDV0EPo5lLqDSZ55VvYM
27/12/23, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Tanisha Valentine Mbewe, and my EWYL group name is Tanisha EWYL23E1067. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
27/12/23, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
27/12/23, 12:19 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Okay thank you
27/12/23, 12:19 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Thank you so much
27/12/23, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/12/23, 12:30 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Absolutely correct
27/12/23, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/12/23, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes it's true
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Noted
27/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Thank you for providing the information
27/12/23, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/12/23, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/12/23, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/12/23, 12:39 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes we have discussed about this
27/12/23, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/12/23, 12:43 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes please go on
27/12/23, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
27/12/23, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/12/23, 12:46 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is __Saloni Rastogi_______ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___2 January 2024_____*(mention the date)
27/12/23, 12:46 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Noted
27/12/23, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
27/12/23, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/12/23, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/12/23, 12:49 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Thank you so much Ms Ashi
27/12/23, 12:50 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Noted
27/12/23, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263717838694
27/12/23, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/12/23, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/12/23, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/12/23, 12:59 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Okay thank you

27/12/23, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263717838694 Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 1:04 PM - +263 71 783 8694: I do not have any queries
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.

27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Absolutely correct
27/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Absolutely correct
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i have followed everything 
 If we want an extension of paying the money will it be okay
27/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263717838694 For this concern, we have already shared this benefit with you, right?
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Okay it's fine
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Can you please share the information
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/12/23, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Noted
27/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes please
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Absolutely true
27/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i do agree
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 2:21 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i am clear about this
27/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 2:22 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i am
27/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
27/12/23, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

27/12/23, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 2:32 PM - +263 71 783 8694: No i do not have any queries
27/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Very excited to go further
27/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 77 185 2432: A good day to you Ms Ashi
6/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 185 2432: I'm so convinced to receive the   offer letter fo Tanisha  though lm afraid of my finance  already there is pending  cash  which is to be paid and on the offer letter it's also talking of payment  within 15days

As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter.

6/1/24, 12:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 71 783 8694: 1. $900
2.  3 years
3.$300
4.$100
6/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please allow me to correct you here please, the Registration Fee is $750. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes,l understand
6/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 783 8694: I understand
6/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Ok  l understand well will go for the much affordable  because we are out of finance but just want our girl to go to school and not disappoint
6/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263771852432,  I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Yes it does clarify very well on accommodation  part, which is good
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes we can move forward
6/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Yes ,you can  go ahead
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 832 1918: $750 this  19 January
6/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Ummm it's too soon for us to get that kind of mine yes lm glad at has been reduced a but still the days are still close can you stretch to Feb  just   a little  bit
6/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771852432, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Please do explain
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 19th 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Loud and clear and thank you for being patient on this explanatory
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263771852432, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes in Harare .Kuwadzana
6/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Thank  you l hope l will meet with the deadline
6/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes you can
6/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
6/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Thank you so much
6/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263717838694. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
6/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I was waiting for your response, Kindly do let me know when you will be able to reconnect with us so that we can complete our discussion. Looking forward for your response, Have a good night ahead!
6/1/24, 10:05 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Thank you
8/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanisha , Wishing you a good day! 

In regards to our previous conversation, I would like to know if you are ready for our today's discussion so that we can discuss about your offer letter. I've been looking forward to our today's discussion to plan the next steps in your admission process. Could you please share your response with us ?
8/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes I'm ready with our session
8/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are ready for the session. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
8/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
8/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes i have understood this
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 783 8694: Yes the EWYL programe is very beneficial and advantageous as the needed money would be reduced
8/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
8/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
8/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 71 783 8694: I do not have any queries
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

19/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand the situation you are in @263771852432. May I know what are your plans ahead ?
19/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 185 2432: We are still looking for a fully funded  scholarship  those of 100%

Kindly excuse me for not continuing with you yesterday as I have been occupied with an urgent meeting. Although, I would like to connect with you to assist your doubts and queries. May I know if you are available for the discussion ?
20/1/24, 9:15 AM - +263 77 185 2432: Morning Ms Ashi sorry for late reply was a bit but but lm free now .
20/1/24, 9:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263771852432, Yesterday as you mentioned that you need a fully funded scholarship I was not able to understand your thoughts here. Would you please explain ?
20/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 185 2432: I meant a scholarship that can offer 100% scholarship
20/1/24, 10:40 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771852432 Let me share that the scholarship percentage given by the university is based on the academic documents, SOP form and other documents. Hence, The scholarship provided by the university for Tanisha is mentioned in the offer letter. 

Considering the challenge you were facing, I have requested the payment plan with an extension from the officials with your approval. As you have not completed the procedure after your mentioned request, I am a bit confused here as we are not able to understand your thought process here.
20/1/24, 12:06 PM - +263 77 185 2432: Well the kind of scholarship  lm looking for her is one that covers almost everything for her ,where l don't even have to pay anything  as lm facing this financial  challenge
20/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While I understand that you are having financial challenge, It's important to recognize that students from around the world are competing for the limited scholarship seats at Galgotias University. The fact that you have already been given this exceptional opportunity for Tanisha reflects the university's recognition of her outstanding academic performance and the quality of her Statement of Purpose.

While we all hope for a scholarship that covers all expenses, it's essential to understand that the available scholarships are based on various factors and are limited in amount. Not everyone will be able to secure a scholarship, and the fact that you have been offered this opportunity as an edoofain is a testament to your potential.
20/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 185 2432: I understand Ms Ashi and have  made  apologies  so what would you suggest  l do with such an issue.
