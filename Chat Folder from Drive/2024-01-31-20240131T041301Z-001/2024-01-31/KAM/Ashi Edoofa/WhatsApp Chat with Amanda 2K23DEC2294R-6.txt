With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 2:43 PM - +260 97 4813102: Thank you
12/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/1/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes
12/1/24, 2:48 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:59 PM - +260 97 4813102: I have gone through the images. You explain more sir?
12/1/24, 3:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/1/24, 3:11 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
12/1/24, 3:18 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes they are clear
12/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/1/24, 3:23 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/1/24, 3:27 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes am following
12/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/1/24, 3:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/1/24, 3:42 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes, very clear
12/1/24, 3:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/1/24, 3:45 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes please, we can go ahead
12/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/1/24, 4:00 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
12/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: I will be sharing the videos now.
12/1/24, 4:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

15/1/24, 6:52 PM - +260 97 4813102: There is a close relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development in many ways .
Maybe it is important to talk about the meaning of entrepreneurship and economic development. Entrepreneurship is an activity of doing business hoping to make   some profit .This activity is about risk taking because business has risks and it is not a must that one can make a profit .However it is the wish of any entrepreneur to go into business which is making a profit. In the case that the business succeed the impact is visible in many ways. On the other hand economic development  is a process by which the   economic well being of both people and a nation is friendly. Where there is economic development, the quality of life in the local community or people is improved. From the definitions I have given above I can say that, the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is purely connected. Once an entrepreneur is doing well, meeting his or her goals and objectives, the benefit will be seen in the profit made which will return will improve the well being of everyone involved in that business. Secondly since economic development is about the quality of life of  people , it means both entrepreneurship and economic development targets the same goals and objectives which is human development. In other word's entrepreneurship contributes to economic growth in any given place. The many new innovations going on around the world is as a result of the process of economic development. The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development summarizes and updates the empirical evidence.
15/1/24, 6:53 PM - +260 97 4813102: Question 2👆🏾, made a lot mistakes my apology.
15/1/24, 9:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Amanda and Parents! I hope all of you are doing great. To ensure a smooth admission process, we will have our session at 10:00 AM tomorrow to take forward our conversation. I hope by then you will be able to answer all the questions in the document. We will further connect in our session tomorrow! Wish you a blessed night. <This message was edited>
15/1/24, 11:02 PM - +260 97 4813102: Question 3.
The word ''GAAP'' stands for generally accepted accounting principles. It is the collection of commonly followed accounting accounting rules and standards for financial reporting. The principles of generally accepted accounting principles includes, 
The principle of continuity. This principle stipulates that in the valuation of asserts, it's assumption that business operations aim to continue. It dictates that, accountants must value asserts based on the assumption that the organization will continue it's normal operations. The second principle is Non compensation. The value of a company 's liabilities should not be compensated for by the value of the company 's asserts. Accountants must clearly report all positive and negative values on a financial statement. The other principle is Prudence. This principle demands for factual basis for all financial reporting and cautions against understanding losses or overstating gains.

15/1/24, 11:02 PM - +260 97 4813102: Question 4
An accounting standard is a common set of principles, standards, and procedures that define the basis of financial accounting policies and practices. It is also known or referred to as authoritative standards.
They are authoritative standards for financial reporting and are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles. Accounting standards specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. In other words, the aim or objectives of accounting standards is to lay down principles and procedures for preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. Consolidated financial statements are presented by holding enterprise to provide financial information
 about the economic activities of it's group.
The reason why they are mandatory is because, they ensure the financial statements from many companies are comparable. All entities follow the same rules accounting standards which make the financial statement credible and allow for more economic decisions based on accurate and consistent information. In other words, it is mandatory for organizations to follow accounting standards because it ensures uniformity in the accounting process.
15/1/24, 11:02 PM - +260 97 4813102: Question 5 
Accounting is the process of recording financial transactions concerning a business. The process of accounting includes summarising, analysing and reporting the recorded transactions to agencies, regulators to mention but a few. Accounting is a word that explains the process of consolidating financial information to make it clear and understandable for all stakeholders and shareholders.

Accrual accounting records revenue and expenses when they occur.
On the other hand, auditing is about conducting an official financial inspection of an organization or company and it's accounts by an auditor. During the process of auditing, physical checking of inventory to make sure that the organization or company is following agreed systems of recording transactions is done.

16/1/24, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Amanda!
How are you all doing today?
16/1/24, 10:18 AM - +260 97 4813102: Good morning sir. This is Amanda , am here we can start.
16/1/24, 10:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are enthusiastic to start with the session. But before starting, may I know how are you doing today?
16/1/24, 10:21 AM - +260 97 4813102: Am doing fine and how are you
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well. Thank you for asking.
16/1/24, 10:23 AM - +260 97 4813102: Welcome sir
16/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for providing the screenshot of the statement of purpose form and the answers to the document. We have taken note of these and will update them in our records. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
16/1/24, 10:27 AM - +260 97 4813102: We can go on
16/1/24, 10:27 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
16/1/24, 10:37 AM - +260 97 4813102: Am not sure about the payments but I will inform my parents about it
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take follow-up on this and understand your preparations better.
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - +260 97 4813102: Alright Sir
16/1/24, 10:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/1/24, 10:40 AM - +260 97 4813102: This message was deleted
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes its true
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
16/1/24, 10:46 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
16/1/24, 10:50 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes I am
16/1/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that! Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
16/1/24, 10:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
16/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
16/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
16/1/24, 10:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
16/1/24, 11:00 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes it is
16/1/24, 11:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
16/1/24, 11:05 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes please
16/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
16/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
16/1/24, 11:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
16/1/24, 11:22 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes I agree
16/1/24, 11:24 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you are in India, you will have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
16/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
16/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
16/1/24, 11:27 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes I do
16/1/24, 11:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zambia you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
16/1/24, 11:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 27 kwacha, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
16/1/24, 11:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
16/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
16/1/24, 11:38 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes that's true
16/1/24, 11:47 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
16/1/24, 11:48 AM - +260 97 4813102: Yes go on
16/1/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 30-January-2024
16/1/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
16/1/24, 11:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
16/1/24, 11:59 AM - +260 97 4813102: Hello, this is Amanda 's Father. We want to make some corrections 
 Amanda is expected to be India August 2024 and not 2025
16/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's nice to meet you, Mr. Mwelwa. May I know when did Amanda appeared for her A Level examinations?
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - +260 97 4813102: 2023, the result should be out this month end or next month February
16/1/24, 12:05 PM - +260 97 4813102: So sorry, I went for work but am back home to help her during this session.
16/1/24, 12:06 PM - +260 97 4813102: The $150 will be paid this week any day
16/1/24, 12:10 PM - +260 97 4813102: I have have a question on financial secure plan, I don't know if I can go on with my question?
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: But as per the Edoofa Acceptance letter, your year of admission mentioned is 2025. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 12:29 PM - +260 97 4813102: I think from the time we started the interview from our end we requested for 2024 intake. 
Our reasons which we forwarded as parents are as follows 
1, Most girl in Zambia if not whole Africa tend to misbehaving when doing nothing for a long time, hence most of them go into early marriages or just fall pregnant because of peer pressure from bad friends. 
2. We wish that Amanda being a first born and a girl we don't delay her entry into university. 
This has been our stand please
16/1/24, 12:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I completely understand your concern, Mr. Mwelwa.  Kindly provide me some time to discuss it with the admissions team. I would like you to be patient till the time, we look into this. I hope you understand?
16/1/24, 12:36 PM - +260 97 4813102: Thank you. And the other reason is that her young brother is doing grade 11 this year, next year he will be completing grade 12. He is very bright and we want him to be in university in 2026
16/1/24, 12:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know about this. We are delighted to hear that Amanda's younger brother is also eager to pursue higher education in India. We would recommend he fill out the admission form for 2026 later this year or the next year as the admissions for 2026 are not open yet.
16/1/24, 12:54 PM - +260 97 4813102: Thank so much, he is very happy to hear this from your end.
16/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to hear that!

26/1/24, 2:37 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes, they will be printed out next week
26/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @260974813102, Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 2:40 PM - +260 97 4813102: Very much accurate.
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/1/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 4813102: Noted
26/1/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes
26/1/24, 2:47 PM - +260 97 4813102: I mean no
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/1/24, 3:03 PM - +260 97 4813102: Okay
26/1/24, 3:04 PM - +260 97 4813102: Noted
26/1/24, 3:05 PM - +260 97 4813102: Beautiful
26/1/24, 3:06 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes
26/1/24, 3:09 PM - +260 97 4813102: We are aware about everything very, the counselor mentioned them
26/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes, we are on the same page
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/1/24, 3:37 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes, noted
26/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
26/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/1/24, 3:41 PM - +260 97 4813102: Okay
26/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/1/24, 3:44 PM - +260 97 4813102: Noted
26/1/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/1/24, 3:46 PM - +260 97 4813102: No queries
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - +260 97 4813102: It is clear
26/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 3:49 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes
26/1/24, 3:50 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes
26/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 3:53 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes, go on
26/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @260974813102. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
26/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 3:55 PM - +260 97 4813102: This is good news 👏👏👏
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - +260 97 4813102: What is the solution? Am not aware of it
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 3:59 PM - +260 97 4813102: No, I think it is clear
26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/1/24, 4:02 PM - +260 97 4813102: It's clear
26/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to know that @260974813102. are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - +260 97 4813102: Yes I am
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
