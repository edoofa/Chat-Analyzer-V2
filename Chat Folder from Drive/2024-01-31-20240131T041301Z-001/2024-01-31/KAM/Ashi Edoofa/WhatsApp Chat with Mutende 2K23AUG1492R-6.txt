10/1/24, 1:34 PM - +260 96 1021268: The problem i have is that there is too much discussion , when people are very busy .
10/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260961021268 May I kindly know if you are busy at the moment ?
10/1/24, 1:40 PM - +260 96 1021268: Yes
10/1/24, 1:40 PM - +260 96 1021268: I’m at work
10/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we schedule our discussion at 7:00 PM, If that's fine with you ?
10/1/24, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mutende, I hope you are doing well.
10/1/24, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion about the offer letter ?
10/1/24, 7:54 PM - +260 96 1021268: Yes
10/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
10/1/24, 8:18 PM - +260 96 1021268: 1. $900
2. 3yrs
10/1/24, 8:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260961021268 Please share the other two as well
10/1/24, 8:22 PM - +260 96 1021268: 3. $300
4. $750
10/1/24, 8:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
10/1/24, 8:25 PM - +260 96 1021268: Yes
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
10/1/24, 8:30 PM - +260 96 1021268: ok
10/1/24, 8:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
10/1/24, 8:32 PM - +260 96 1021268: yes
10/1/24, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
10/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260961021268 Are we still connected ?
10/1/24, 9:03 PM - +260 96 1021268: Yes
10/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
10/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 23rd 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
10/1/24, 9:07 PM - +260 96 1021268: I’m
clear on this but why can’t we go straight to the point than this  time consuming questioning on the basics . I need details about the university
10/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260961021268 I understand that you need the details about the university but these information are important in order to make you understand the process better otherwise you will not be able to understand the amount you need to pay and other details, right ?
10/1/24, 10:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As I was looking forward for your response, I want to share that my working hours are over. Hence, I would like to schedule our session with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.

That is not critical but need to understand the details of university , location and that is all . Anyway don’t bother I Have asked freind in India to

11/1/24, 10:49 AM - +260 96 1021268: <Media omitted>
13/1/24, 8:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mutende, I hope you are doing well!

I truly understand where you are coming from that you have been occupied with your work commitment. I hope you understand not every family is similar while understanding such an offer letter, I do understand that you are confident enough to understand the offer letter quite well as you have been around numbers your whole life. However, there are some students and their parents who are not as well educated as you are. 

Therefore, such discussions are important to make sure that both the students and their parents understand every aspect of the offer letter as they are planning for their child's higher education. The process we are following is based on the experience we have gained over the past 15 years in understanding the requirements of the students and parents. While we appreciate that you have already understood everything, it won't be practically possible to change the approach as the process for every student is the same.
13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: If in the future you feel like we have not shared some important detail with you about the university or offer letter then we would not be able to understand your thought process, right? In order to avoid such circumstances, we make sure that you and your family are well-informed about the offer letter and the university. I hope you understand that we are planning for your child just like you are making sure that Mutende receives the best education, we are making sure to provide you the best opportunity. 

Hence, I hope you can devote some of your time to making sure you choose the right path for your child's career. If you are not able to devote a minimum of 1 hour a day to your child's career, in that case, I am a bit confused about your expectations for your child's Higher Education.
13/1/24, 8:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally, As you mentioned that we are an agent, let me help you understand that we are not any agency as the opportunities provided by us will not be available to the agent. If you think the other way you are more than welcome to go with those organisations. We have built an educational space with 15+ years of experience, Being an educational organization. we have worked with 250+ Universities, Schools & Colleges. Because of all the good work that we’ve done by providing our services for more than 15 years and the credibility we’ve built, we’ve been entrusted with a total of a $10 Million Scholarship Fund from the Education Trusts of government-recognized and accredited universities, schools and colleges to admit the most deserving students.
13/1/24, 8:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Every Edoofian has received a scholarship from one of the best universities in India. If you want to know what Edoofa does for its students, let me share that Edoofa not only provides scholarship opportunities but also makes sure that the students are employable and ready by giving them the chance to self-fund their education. I am sure no other organization can give such opportunities. We have always guided you for the best of your child and being the wise parent you are you have decided to continue in the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
13/1/24, 8:15 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With all the hard work we have put here for you and Mutende if you are comparing our efforts with some other organization based on the services we provide. Maybe it's a disrespect to our organization and to the commitment you have made. Let me share that Edoofa's founders come every year to your country to have an event for our students, I am sure no other organization can make this much effort for their students. If you are on the same page with us, only then I will be more than happy to discuss it with you. Otherwise, I can share the details of the university with you but in my concise mind, I will not be doing justice to your child.
13/1/24, 8:38 AM - +260 96 1021268: Simple request about University but I receive essays as an answer.
13/1/24, 8:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am confused with your expectations here, Have you gone through the messages we have shared?

13/1/24, 8:43 AM - +260 96 1021268: That was my request , and it is critical to decision making than the content of the offer letter which are self explanatory (I suppose thatvis why the offer letter is written , it is to be read and understood )
