30/12/23, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are doing well. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you have the remaining part of $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee which is due by 14th December 2023.

2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 409 1814: But we need her to attain higher education
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 409 1814: She wanted her education but suspended
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me as I am not able to understand what is the concern due to which Hilda is not able to pursue her Education
2/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 409 1814: I have explained. We are unable to meet the payments
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you have financial concern, however I am curious to understand why you want to take this decision now as you are not aware of the cost of education for Hilda yet, right?
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 77 409 1814: We failed to meet the deadline of paying the 150 and can we be given a longer payment plan and from the conversation we discovered that more payments were needed
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774091814 If you have been given flexible payment plan would you be able to afford Hilda's Education? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 409 1814: Yes and the other hindering factor was her termination of employment which left us with no option
2/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 409 1814: She was going to fund another part
2/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that the current situation is very challenging. I would do my best to make sure that we assist you so that Hilda can pursue her education
2/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 409 1814: Thank you so much

2/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263774091814
5/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Hilda, Wishing you a good day!

5/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are doing well, thank you for asking. I would like to connect with you today in order to understand what are your plans for the remaining Edoofa Enrollment fee. Could you please share your response with us?
5/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 409 1814: Yes
5/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263774091814 Please share your response
5/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 409 1814: My situation as I once said is that my financial situation is not palatable and Hilda's contract was terminated at the end of 2023 so everything is in doldrums
5/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I remember that once you have shared your financial concerns with us, as we have mentioned that we will help you in this situation by giving you a flexible payment plan. I hope you remember the same?
5/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 409 1814: Yes but failed to meet deadlines
5/1/24, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that you have missed the deadline to complete the payment, but as we also understand that you want Hilda to pursue her Higher Education. I will try to request the academic board for extension, hence I would like to know when you think you will be able to complete this remaining amount ?
5/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 409 1814: February
5/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please specify the exact date @263774091814

5/1/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed weekend and please extend our regards to your family as well.
15/1/24, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Hilda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/1/24, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 1:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
15/1/24, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 1:00 PM to 04:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
15/1/24, 8:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Hilda,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 579 2587: good day I am glad I have received the offer letter thank you so much
16/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263775792587May I know if you have gone through the letter ?
16/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 579 2587: I have
16/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through the offer letter. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
16/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
16/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 579 2587: 1.  $975                                                                                                                     2.  3years                                                                                                                       3.  $200                                                                                                                   4.  $700
16/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
16/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 77 579 2587: clear
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
16/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
16/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 579 2587: noted
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
16/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
16/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
16/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are following the conversation. You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
16/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 77 579 2587: clear
16/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 29th, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
16/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
16/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
16/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/1/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *January 29th, 2024*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
16/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 579 2587: Harare yes
16/1/24, 8:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you today due to an urgent meeting. Please do let me know when you would like to connect with us tomorrow
17/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Hilda, Wishing you a good day!

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I would like to connect with you so that we can share more information about the university and offer letter. May I kindly know if you are available now for the discussion ?
17/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 77 409 1814: At work now Hilda can you connect
17/1/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Hilda can connect with us please
17/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 77 579 2587: good afternoon
17/1/24, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, Shall we continue our discussion ?
17/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear,  If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 579 2587: thank you
17/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 579 2587: no thank you
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 77 579 2587: yes
17/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 579 2587: no
17/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
17/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
