16/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Comfort,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level / 12th grade  results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level / 12th grade results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

29/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Comfort, Wishing you a good day! 

According to your scholarship application, You have a due amount of $150 which is to be paid by 30th of January, 2024.  It is important to complete the registration process by the deadline. I am reaching out to inquire about your preparation for the journey. Have you set a date to finalize the transaction?
29/1/24, 4:59 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Documents submitted to bank today. They may not remit the funds by tomorrow because of the international transfer processes but atleast the transaction will be in progress.

Good afternoon to you and team.
29/1/24, 5:02 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: However going back to the offer letter, it seems accommodation and meals, laundry, examinations etc are not within the US$2500 fees. I asked about the same earlier but I didn't receive a clear response. Would you please clarify
29/1/24, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with me regarding the payment.
29/1/24, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have shared a query regarding the expenses, Could you please elaborate what is your query ?
29/1/24, 5:46 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: In short clarify the letter in detail
29/1/24, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999860662 Let's have a session tomorrow at 3:00 pm to clear your doubts
29/1/24, 9:28 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Noted
30/1/24, 3:31 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Heloo
30/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @265999860662, How is your day going on ?
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: So far so good. What about you?
30/1/24, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: My day is also going well, thank you for asking
30/1/24, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you were having some doubts regarding the expenses mention in the offer letter, Would you please let me know if there is any specific doubt here ?
30/1/24, 3:41 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Yes,  I see that there are other expenses on top of the $1000 (scholarship shortfall).
30/1/24, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to assist you regarding your doubts, however I am not able to understand which expenses you have mentioned here. Please specify your doubt <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Quest Group of Institutions:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee, Uniform Fee, Library Fees - $100
3. Per Annum On-Campus Accommodation Fees - $750 - $1200
30/1/24, 4:00 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Thus a total of $1850 minimum
30/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @265999860662
30/1/24, 4:05 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Then is that not on the higher side compared to what we were discussing earlier with your colleagues? It was a range of between 500 - 1000 dollars
30/1/24, 4:14 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Abhinav said that between 500 & 600$ for six months, making $1200 per year because she was getting a higher scholarship. But here seems she has been offered the lowest scholarship. 

(This is Correction on earlier amounts I gave) <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts here, Let me help you understand the process here. As Mr. Abhinav have shared with you that Comfort has been offered the higher scholarship, due to which the cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $1200 - $1800 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The range of $500 - $1000 is for the registration fees not for the tuition fees please
30/1/24, 4:28 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: I still have a request since Comfort's total fees is below the range of $6000-8000, you would have atleast considered her for a higher percentage of scholarship than the one you have offered now, atleast 80% above would have been much better. We are the middle class people and my earnings doesn't even get to $300 per month
30/1/24, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your thought process here, I wanted to take a moment to address the scholarship percentage that Comfort has been offered is based on her academic performance and the response she provided in her SOP.

However, I also wanted to share that there is an opportunity to further reduce the cost of education through the Earn While You Learn program. This program allows students to self finances their education, which can greatly alleviate the financial burden of education. I hope this is helpful and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
30/1/24, 4:41 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: I don't know what her feedback was on SOP, was it that we are capable of paying highest shortfall? I see that the shortfall here is above $1800 which is maximum on shortfalls. Yet on Comfort's offer $1850 is deemed to be the minimum. Ca you please explain,  I am still concerned on the higher cost.

Even though there's EWYL but this will mean the student will have sleepless nights to cover the shortfall <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It appears that you have some concerns about the cost of her education. I want to assure you that we have provided all the necessary information about the expenses. However, I understand that these matters can be overwhelming. If there are specific details or questions you'd like to discuss, I'm here to address them and ensure that we are all on the same page.
30/1/24, 5:32 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: I have raised all my concerns and my expectation is a consideration from the  scholarship program as you rightly said that you would want higher education accessible and affordable for more children to pursue their dreams. Thanks
30/1/24, 8:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, my operational hours for the day have concluded. Let us reconnect tomorrow at 4:00 pm to further discuss the admission process. I wish you a blessed day ahead!
30/1/24, 8:24 PM - +265 999 86 06 62: Thank you, good night
