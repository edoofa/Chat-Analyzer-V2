20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet

27/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:07 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: oooo oky thank you
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Tuesday (02nd January 2024)*. If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well .....lemme discuss with my parents ...and agree on it
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265888287628. May I know if we can move ahead with our today's discussion?
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Pharmacy* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/12/23, 4:17 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/12/23, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes she did
27/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/12/23, 4:36 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
27/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: oky
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/12/23, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/12/23, 4:55 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: understood.
27/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 5:00 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well am quite confused ...about the registration fee payment
27/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, May I know what is the confusion here please?
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: from the first previous discussions i thought we are not required to pay the fee......that is deducted from the annual pay .....
27/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888287628 You are correct that the registration fees is reduced from the first year tuition fees, however in order to reduce the amount you need to pay the fees, I am sure your counselor also have shared the same information with you, right?
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: i believe so but perhaps its me who didn't understand it well
27/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, May I know if it's clear now?
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:21 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: nice
27/12/23, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/12/23, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/12/23, 5:24 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: thank you
27/12/23, 5:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: i have but i dont really understand them
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 5:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 5:43 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: oky
27/12/23, 5:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 5:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 5:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 5:58 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 6:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 6:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 6:03 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
27/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 9:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, I was looking forward for your response, I would love to connect with you to have a discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 12:52 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: good morning you all 
hope your all doing great ....and we're also fine 

Well i must say am and we're all really confused ....in regards to our yesterdays conversation .....

if you keep up the conversation on 26 October ...there was no mention of another payment apart from the enrollment free ，which we have paid and perhaps the travel expenses but not registration fee 
so we're all confused
28/12/23, 12:55 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: perhaps, tell us the total amount that is to be paid before coming to indian ...maybe that would clear the confusion ...
28/12/23, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ekalhi, Wishing you a good day!
28/12/23, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your confusion, let me help you here in understanding the registration fees.

28/12/23, 1:03 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes i have taken note
28/12/23, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you must have gone through this message as well, right?
28/12/23, 1:12 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope now you understand that the registration fees is needed in order to reserve your scholarship seat however you don't have to worry about this registration fees as this is not an additional fees as this will be adjusted in your first year tuition fees.
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand?
28/12/23, 1:30 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: now i understand
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 1:36 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: no.queries for now
28/12/23, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 1:40 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: sure
28/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

17/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

3-$2250
4-$125

17/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888287628 Kindly go through the offer letter again as 1 and 3 are incorrect
17/1/24, 3:56 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: oky
17/1/24, 3:57 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: If I understand well,its 4000, 0, 5550, 125 and 1000USDs
17/1/24, 4:03 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: oooo i thought they said after the scholarship ya
17/1/24, 4:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
17/1/24, 4:15 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
17/1/24, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250(tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
17/1/24, 4:25 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Yaaa well crarified
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
17/1/24, 4:34 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Sory that am taking time to come in, this has been a hectic one. If you remember I said I was politicaly dismissed from work, then I appealed and I was called for an appeals desciplinary hearing today. Just as I was entering the hearing room got a call telling me that my late brother's form 3 son has died on the sport after been hit by a motor cycle, so am doing two things at a time. Hope you understand my situation
17/1/24, 4:49 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: yes
17/1/24, 6:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am worry to hear about your loss @265998889355, My best regards are with you please take your time in this crucial time your family needs you.

18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/1/24, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/1/24, 1:33 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Yes to us we say thank yiu God. Help us understand the letter
18/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Let's start our discussion for today
18/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2250, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/1/24, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/1/24, 1:43 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Very clear and comendable
18/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250- $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/1/24, 1:50 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: This is avery helpful program, it will assist us as parents
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2250 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $1250for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
18/1/24, 2:06 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Yes make us understand this regfee, its making my child daily as she thinks about me on how to go as you know. Am thinking day in day out.
18/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265998889355 Would you please explain your message ?
18/1/24, 3:12 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: My conern on reg fee of 1000 USDs to be paid within 15days.
18/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265998889355  Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 30th, 2024*. <This message was edited>
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Yes do that
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 30th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 30th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/1/24, 3:28 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Its clear indeed
18/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Alright, am Innocent Maganga a Malawian born in Zimbabwe but grown up in Malawi, staying in Malawi
18/1/24, 3:33 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Staying in Zimbabwe is Hamilton Maganga my young brother
18/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/1/24, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/1/24, 3:44 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: When wev were paying the 350USDs, 40USDs was done by Hamilton Maganga through Zimbabwe and 310USDs was paid by me here in Malawi through Nation Bank of Nalawi
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, You can either pay through Mr. Rajan using Mukuru. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
18/1/24, 3:48 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: Well understood
18/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/1/24, 3:53 PM - +265 998 88 93 55: I think for today no more queries. Share with us the University insights.
18/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

22/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you are having financial constraints, in that case May I know how are you planning ahead as you will need the funds for your education right ?
22/1/24, 2:31 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well as of now nothing yet just looking onto GOD to do something otherwise i have no uncles or aunties to seek help from
22/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While I truly understand your situation my dear, I would like to know why have you not prepared your finances in prior dear?
22/1/24, 2:42 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well actually we started this that was when my dad was still working then few weeks later he was then dismissed from work ....that is why it seems very too hard to raise the money because we were depending on my dad through his work ....so after what happened it has been very tough

its not like we didnt want to plan, we had plans but unfortunately even dairly feeding is now so hard .....
22/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I can see that you had an unforeseen circumstances dear, Being your admission officer you have my full support dear. Although, In order to move ahead you will need the finances, May I know how are your parents planning to raise the funds ?
22/1/24, 2:50 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: where honestly nothing as of yet .....i would haave said they will get loarns maybe from people and other groups but as it stands now its not even possible cause the last paid fee (enrollment fee) they took loarns which they havent paid and settled yet so they seem very confuse to as how the will raise it ...so as it stands there is nothing they can do now ....i dont know how you can help us ....
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand the situation you are coming from, As you have indeed facing some tought challenges with respect to finances. I would do my best to help you here, however in order to help you here I need to have a better understanding sbout how are you planning to raise the finances for your registration process, What are you doing for the same?
22/1/24, 3:04 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well nothing yet .....waiting on God through my dad ....he's been moving up and down to find work so that maybe he will start raising it .....but he has not found work yet ....and even if he were to find it now he still wouldnt make in 15 days  or even a month ....cause working here is tough and since the whole family is waiting on him ....it wont only be me he will be providing for cause i have 4 other sisters ....who are looking onto him now ....honestly 
we're confused
22/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case, I want to understand what are your expectations here considering the current situation ?
22/1/24, 3:11 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well maybe if you can help us .....it would be really great
22/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, I am there to help you here but I am not able to understand how can I assist you considering that there is no plan to move ahead ?
22/1/24, 3:17 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: well ...i wonder if would have been possible that my parents should try and find means to be paying the money ....while am already there so that i dont miss this chance please ....the little they will be able to raise now they will b paying until they finish ....so maybe if you can consider our sincere request 🙏
22/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, I completely understand where you are coming from. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
22/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
22/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $100 out of the $1000 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in later but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment since your first deadline stands on 30th January so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
22/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted to study abroad in the first place so that you does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?

22/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888287628 May I know if you have connected with your parents about the same ?

29/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265888287628 I want to understand what is the challenge due to which you are not able to raise the funds needed for the registration process ?
29/1/24, 2:14 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: my father's wok dismissal ...no business to help us through ....loans we havent paid yet ....so its just too hard
29/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I can see that you are having financial challenges here, I am assuming that is the reason due to which you are not able to complete the registration process, right ?
29/1/24, 2:17 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: exactly 100%
29/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, As your admission officer I don't want you to lose this opportunity and hence I am here to provide you some solution. Before that I need to understand by when are you assuming that you will be able to raise the needed amount for the registration process ?
29/1/24, 2:34 PM - +265 888 28 76 28: not sure yet but i should ask my dad so that i can communicate to you ...

30/1/24, 7:10 AM - +265 888 28 76 28: Goodmorning everyone 
i hope your all doing great 

well in regards to our yesterdays conversation i was asked to present my dad's response on the matter in a text form .....as he is an able to do it himself due to technical difficults.

from the audio sent above, his response says; well was apologising for the inability to raise the needed money for my university administration , looking at his current situation he's not sure when he will be able to raise the money due to his dismissal and since he never kept money in the bank as the dismissal was too sudden and unexpected the whole situation leaves him confused with not direct answer 

offcause he is waiting to be call back to work maybe in febuary but even at that he wouldnt direct have the money ...so he will have to wait atleast two to three months to  atleast be able to apply for a loan at work 
thus the only option he has but since its out of the offered dates 
he would have loved if i never lost this great opportunity  but what can he do.
so he was asking that if there is any possible way you can help us please do 

but he is truly sorry for he's financial challenges at hand
30/1/24, 11:58 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ekalhi, Wishing you a good day!
