The counselor sent it once
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - +263 73 736 4250: We can proceed
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
26/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Crystal clear ma'am
26/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
26/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 73 736 4250: I am, let's proceed
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/12/23, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am they are
26/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am
26/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

26/12/23, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263773797485
27/12/23, 12:53 AM - +263 73 736 4250: These videos have much clarified information about the Edoofa program from the co-founders of the program. They enlighten on the vision of the Edoofa program which is not only to make education affordable buh to also make students undergo success as well as being independent at the same time. They urge one to follow all the instructions as it is good for the proceedings of the program as well as being one of the reasons which leads to success. I also managed to understand that they chose certain universities which offer the highest education in terms of the teachers' teaching abilities and highest quality of education and most of all they urge hardwork. What i have mostly liked and adored about the Edoofa program is that they make students go out there and give back to the community so as to gain experience  working with people and as well help them for future references. The last step is the statement of purpose which one receives after watching the forth video in which one gets to express and convince why he or she has to get admitted into a certain university

Thank you
27/12/23, 12:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawananyasha, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to see that you have gone through the videos and have share some amazing insights with us. I would like to add some insights here, May I know if you are ready for today's session?
27/12/23, 12:27 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes i am...
27/12/23, 12:30 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Good Afternoon
27/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 12:39 PM - +263 77 379 7485: We do understand
27/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you so much

27/12/23, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 12:44 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes we are ma'am
27/12/23, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:00 PM.
27/12/23, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

28/12/23, 1:52 AM - +263 73 736 4250: Number 1
28/12/23, 1:52 AM - +263 73 736 4250: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that rights are claims of and individual that are essential for the development of his own self and that are recognized by society or even state whereas a duty is something that someone is expected to do. Some of the duties include that of obeying laws, paying taxes, defending the nation and serving on juries. There are also types of duties like that of legal duties, professional duties and many more. Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whereas Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Human Rights include that of the right to life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health, education and an adequate standard of living and these are at an individual or personal level and at the same time civil rights include that of the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, the right to government services, the right to a public education, the right to gainful employment, the right to housing, the right to use public facilities, freedom of religion

3. The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the  defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence.

4.The branch of Law in which im interested in pursuing is the corporate law. This is the body of law which governs the rights, relations and conduct of people, companies, organizations and businesses. This also refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations. The reason behind studying this type of law is that my main aim is helping, and mostly standing with the truth, as i will be governing the rights of people I get to help people out there whom are being deprived of their rights in which their voices need to be heard, i can also stand against abuses within people out there, be it child abuse or even marital abuse. All in all helping the community for the good is the goal.

5. The skills i have that will help me in becoming a very good and successful lawyer include that of organizational skills. This is whereby i can proudly say i am someone who uses her resources efficiently and effectively.  Most of all im not someone who can just let an opportunity slip and leave it like that. Another skill is time management, since primary level up to date im not someone who isn't punctual, punctuality is something i put first in life because time does not not wait for anyone once you lose time or an opportunity, you are not to get any of it back which makes me want to strive to be  more and more better everyday as to time management is concerned. I can also proudly say that i have written communication skills, whereby i can express my self clearly out there and well as constructing a logical argument with facts which is one of the things needed to pursue the career i have chosen. Lastly, persuasive communication is yet another skill, since growing up i have been told that confidence is the key to even success because once one is confident about what she does nothing will ever go wrong and most of all when one is confident she is likely to have people go against because she will be there to stand up with the facts. I believe with all this i can accomplish my law career

28/12/23, 1:54 AM - +263 73 736 4250: Ma'am the letter from my school, i believe all the tasks you have given me are done now
28/12/23, 11:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tawananyasha, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response with us, although your response for SOP form is not submitted, Kindly fill the form again please.
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Noted
28/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Good afternoon
28/12/23, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Have you checked the Sop form?
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - +263 77 379 7485: We are trying to check, the network is bad today
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In the meantime I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024).
28/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JjiY7vyjo7RBw9eC9FP7oX
28/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Sakaike Tawananyasha, and my EWYL group name is Tawananyasha EWYL23E1071. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
28/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
28/12/23, 1:14 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
28/12/23, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/12/23, 1:18 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am its correct
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yeah that's true
28/12/23, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Yes he has discussed it with us
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes we are on the same page
28/12/23, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
28/12/23, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350 . The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Ok maam
28/12/23, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok i understand
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 73 736 4250: No questions ma'am
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 73 736 4250: That's nice
28/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 73 736 4250: So ma'am i still have to redo the SOP
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263737364250 If you response is not submitted in that case you need to refill the SOP form please.
28/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
28/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
28/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

28/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Quite understood
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians.

28/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
28/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Im done..
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Im following.....
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Im following...
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes it does
28/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
28/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 73 736 4250: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263737364250
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Noo its crystal clear
28/12/23, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Enlighten us
28/12/23, 3:16 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Please provide information on this
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/12/23, 3:22 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Understood
28/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you for e clarification
28/12/23, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Thats true
28/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes
28/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok i get it
28/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
28/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Its clear
28/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
28/12/23, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/12/23, 3:44 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes it is
28/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
28/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/12/23, 3:45 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ok
28/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 73 736 4250: No we don't
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Very very excited ma'am
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
10/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 73 736 4250: It is such an honor
10/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes we have

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

10/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 1:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
10/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 73 736 4250: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$250
5.$1000
10/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
10/1/24, 1:18 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Its a very good offer and im soo excited
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that @263737364250 . As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
10/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am it does
Its quite understandable
10/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 73 736 4250: So does the $1850 include that $1000 or its plus $1000 on top of that amount
10/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, This amount includes the $1000 please. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
10/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Im done ma'am let's continue
10/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education. <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 1:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
10/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes it is
So what kind of tasks will you be doing
10/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The projects will be shared by your mentor, you can connect with her so that you can start working on the projects.
10/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ma'am
10/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 73 736 4250: It is understandable ma'am
10/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
10/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
10/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you ma'am
10/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Not quite clear ma'am
10/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Sorry for the late responses, was very busy at work today
10/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
10/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok its clear now
10/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 23rd, 2024*.
10/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes ma'am i noticed
10/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes please explain
10/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 23rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 23rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 23rd, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Yes it is clear
The one to pay in installments is better
10/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 73 736 4250: No we reside in Chegutu
10/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I am going to through all your conversations now
10/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263773797485
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok thank you
10/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
10/1/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
10/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 73 736 4250: We have them
10/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok thank you
10/1/24, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
10/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 73 736 4250: No, all is clear ma'am
10/1/24, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

10/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I have gone through all conversation 

So this means that if i make the payment of $900 now then i will make another payment of $850, then that will be all for the first year?
10/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 73 736 4250: The university is nice
10/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 379 7485: The university is beautiful
10/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have gone through our discussion, You are absolutely right. You will be required to complete the payment of $1000 for the registration process and then before your arrival you will be required to pay the $850 for first year tuition fees
10/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I have a question, will the registration process be affected by the outcome of Tawananyasha's A'level results
10/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I am going to opt for paying in installments
10/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Would you like to elaborate your query ?
10/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 379 7485: Will the scholarship be affects by her results?
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263773797485 In case a she achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate your application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I understand, thank you
10/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 379 7485: I am hoping to pay enrolment balance before the end of this week, and the first $450 registration instalment before the first due date

I hope i find you well this morning

I wanted to ask when we will get the official offer letter from the University?
15/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tawananyasha, How was your weekend ?
15/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with us. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
15/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 73 736 4250: Ok the query is that the acceptance letter did not pop up in our email..
15/1/24, 9:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing dear, however the university have shared the offer letter with you. In order to verify Kindly check your inbox and spam folder once please.
