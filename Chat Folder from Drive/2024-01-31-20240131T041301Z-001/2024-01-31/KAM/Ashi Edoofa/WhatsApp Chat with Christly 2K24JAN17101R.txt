If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes we may start
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok, we may proceed
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
30/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
30/1/24, 3:43 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
30/1/24, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes I an
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 78 835 4179: They are all clear
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes sure we may commence
30/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Yes please

30/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788354179 I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I can go through them right away
30/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Please do let me know once you have gone through the videos
30/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok thank you
30/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome
30/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I am done now
30/1/24, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
30/1/24, 4:39 PM - +263 78 835 4179: Ok sure
30/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 78 835 4179: For the first video, I managed to gather that as much as a student wants to be successful,  if he doesn't put in the necessary work and effort required even reaching out for help, success will definitely be out of reach for the student , that is why we are encouraged to have open minded for new ideas and help in our endeavours, and another key point is following instructions
30/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 78 835 4179: On the Second video,  there was emphasis on how Edoofa is concerned about a student's success and that is not just about their academic success buh also their success after their education that includes making them employable and cultivating certain skills needed for one to be the first preference for a particular job or cultivating qualities that make Edoofians stand out of the crowd and it also focuses on making them independent by" increasing their capacity for success "
30/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 835 4179: For the third video,  it was highlighted for Edoofa took out the time to reach out to different schools trying to find the ones that stood out which could offer quality education and as our parents, they took a lot into account which made them reach at various conclusions pertaining to diffent schools so that is the reason why following instructions will help in showing how grateful we are for the effort and time put for the provision of such" prestigious institutions "
30/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 78 835 4179: And lastly but not least, the last video brought out the fact about how Edoofa issues out SOP which is the very backbone to one gettin admitted into any institutions as it highlights our strengths and weaknesses and why they should admit us because Edoofa would have taken out the time to interview student and analysing whether they qualify to be enrolled into the Edoofa Program thereby making it more realible as they are able to compose the SOP using the details and good traits gathered from interviews and counselling sessions
30/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 78 835 4179: I think that is most of it
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263788354179, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
30/1/24, 5:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
