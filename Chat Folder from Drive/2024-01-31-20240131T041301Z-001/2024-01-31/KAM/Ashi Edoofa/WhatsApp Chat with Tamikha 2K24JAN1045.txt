I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes,we may start
19/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 214 7249: You may explain!
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
19/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
19/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Very clear!
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
19/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay noted
19/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l am
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
19/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
19/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 214 7249: l am very clear
19/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
19/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes you may

19/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263712147249 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 214 7249: My network is a little bad so l will inform you once lm done
19/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263712147249, I will be looking forward for your response.
19/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
20/1/24, 9:03 AM - +263 71 214 7249: Greetings!
My understanding on those four videos was that the students should be following instructions as given and also the students need to be teachable and should be open minded as they are being taught.Edoofa helps the students to focus and also increase their capacity for success.With the help of Edoofa,students become more responsible and more independent.As for the Founders,they encourage students to follow instructions of the institutions.The statement of purpose is an important document which students should be prompt in taking action and be able to fill the forms.
20/1/24, 9:05 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tamikha, I hope you are doing well.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your insights with us regarding the videos. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/1/24, 9:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/1/24, 9:07 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Thank you
This has been noted and understood!
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

22/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 2.From my understanding, UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) are two interdependent terms, UI generally deals with the interaction between users and computer systems, software and applications whilist UX deals more generally with a user's overall experience with a brand, product or service.UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app or other electronic devices whilist UX refers to the entire interaction you have with a product.User interface and User experience are intertwined elements coherently existing to define the usability and functionality of a digital product.Both UI and UX design are essential for creating successful websites or mobile applications that meets the needs of the user and provides a positive experience.UI and UX design play a pivotal role in ensuring a product offers solutions to a user's problems and, most importantly, provides an exciting and hassle-free experience. They also increase the usability and functionality of the software.It improves product quality,it literally makes digital products more useable and  it can also benefit customer satisfaction, long-term engagement, employee productivity, brand loyalty, time to market, conversion metrics and brand equity.
22/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 3.The Open Systems Interconnection model is a framework in network communication designed to simplify complex network interactions into a structured format. This architecture has seven layers. All the seven layers work together to create a robust and efficient network communication system.
Starting with layer 1 :The Physical Layer deals with the physical aspects of data transmission, including cable types, electrical signals and data rates.It involves hardware components like cables, switches and network interface cards, forming the foundation of network communication.

Layer 2:The Data Link Layer frames data into packets. It handles physical addressing through MAC addresses, ensuring that data is directed to the correct hardware.This layer is also involved in error detection and handling, improving overall data transmission reliability.

Layer 3:This is the Network Layer,this layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing data packets across different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from source to destination.The Internet Protocol , fundamental for internet data exchange, operates at this layer.

Layer 4:The Transport Layer is crucial for segmenting data into smaller packets. It ensures end-to-end data integrity and delivery, managing flow control, error correction and sequencing.TCP is an example of the main protocols in this layer

Layer 5:The Session Layer coordinates communication between systems, managing dialogues and synchronizing data exchange.

Layer 6:The Presentation Layer acts as a translator, converting data formats from the application layer into a network-compatible format and vice versa. It ensures that data sent from one system is readable by another.

Layer 7:The Application Layer is the closest to the end user. It facilitates user interaction with networked systems, providing interfaces and protocols for web browsers, email clients and other applications.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 4.Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that instruct a computer how to perform a task.Programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions in a computer, application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform.There are three types of programming languages which are machine language, assembly language and high-level language.As far as web and software development goes Python,JavaScript,  are among the most popular programming languages in today's market.They are mostly used because they act as a means for humans to communicate instructions to computers and create software solutions.Programming languages to translate directions into binary code that devices can follow as apps, websites, and software programs.Also,programming languages to translate directions into binary code that devices can follow as apps, websites, and software programs.Also,VBA is a version of Visual Basic that can be used to program Microsoft Office apps, such as Excel and PowerPoint.
22/1/24, 12:16 PM - +263 71 214 7249: 5.The differnces between an interpreter and a compiler are that the interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language,without converting it into machine code whilist a compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.An interpreter translates one statement of the program at a time into machine code whilist the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster execution since no translation is needed during runtime and the  interpreter translates code line by line during execution, making it easier to detect errors but potentially slowing down the program.Memory requirement is more on the compilers whilist memory requirement is less on interpreters.
22/1/24, 12:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response for the academic questions, May I know if you have completed the SOP form as well ?

22/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue with our discussion ?
22/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 214 7249: lm not yet done with the ewyl group but we can continue
22/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
22/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fees. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
22/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
thank you for the reminder
22/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 71 214 7249: the fees is yet to be paid anytime this week
22/1/24, 1:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, I have taken a note of the update. In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes, thats very correct
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
22/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l agree
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay, well understood
22/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes,correct!
22/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
22/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 214 7249: yes l did
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Good day
22/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 78 261 0514: Its clear
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay noted
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/1/24, 2:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 214 7249: okay
noted
22/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 214 7249: noted
22/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 214 7249: No queries
We may continue
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
22/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes we are, thank you very much!
22/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Pkay,This is nice
22/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
22/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
22/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes, l woukd like to hear the news
22/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
22/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
22/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 71 214 7249: For the registration? lm not sure
l only know about the EWYL.
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
22/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Oh l understand
22/1/24, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 214 7249: I have no queries
22/1/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
22/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 214 7249: Yes l am
22/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned.
22/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, @263712147249 . I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.
