30/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 2:46 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 71 680 2311: Its can be very unfortunate for me to continue to tertiary education basing on the situation lam currently facing.

30/1/24, 3:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

30/1/24, 4:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others.

30/1/24, 4:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Studying law in India offers a unique and enriching experience. The legal education system in India is well-regarded globally, and Indian law degrees are recognized in all countries, including Ireland and the UK. Additionally, India's legal framework is diverse, providing exposure to a wide range of legal traditions and systems.

By choosing to study law in India, you'll not only gain a solid foundation in the subject but also explore the complexities of a legal system deeply rooted in a rich cultural and historical context. This could offer you a well-rounded perspective that complements your understanding of law in countries like Ireland and the UK.

Moreover, studying in India often provides a cost-effective option without compromising on the quality of education. It's a fantastic opportunity to broaden your horizons while obtaining a credible legal education.

To give a example you will find a lot of students working with UN government offices or Embassies or even International Court of Justice have done their degrees from India
30/1/24, 4:44 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Infact there is Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Bar Council of India (BCI) and its counterparts in England and Wales has confirmed that the English and Welsh legal services market is open to Indian lawyers and law firms.
