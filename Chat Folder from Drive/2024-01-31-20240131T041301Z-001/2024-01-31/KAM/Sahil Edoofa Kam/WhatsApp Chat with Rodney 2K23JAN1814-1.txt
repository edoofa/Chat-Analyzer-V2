16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rodney,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 9:25 AM - Harmehak Edoofa added Sahil Edoofa Kam
29/1/24, 9:54 AM - Harmehak Edoofa: Good Day ⁩@263785063324 , 

I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician @919821838532⁩ to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
29/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 506 3324: How are you madam
29/1/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 506 3324: Okay I'm available

29/1/24, 10:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 10:59 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 11:05 AM - +263 78 506 3324: Last year I was supposed to pay the registration fee and of which we faced a family and of which the money which we were supposed to save for the registration process had to start catering for the problem which was at hand and lately I and my family we have been trying to gather funds and of which it has been hard because we went through  a serious debt which was supposed be relayed as urgent as possible so at the moment things are still hard but we promise to offer our best
29/1/24, 11:26 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are parents ready now ?
29/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 506 3324: We just discussed the matter now and they are saying things are still tough for them but they will make sure all is met
29/1/24, 1:56 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you the please share your A level results ?
29/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Okay madam
29/1/24, 2:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: By when can you share this please?

29/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
29/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

29/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
29/1/24, 3:36 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah the tuition fees are very expensive because most jobs here in Zimbabwe don't pay their workers more than 300 usd and of most one person will be providing for the whole family which makes things more complicated and tough because there will be other responsibilities to cater for
Not only that there are no jobs here in Zimbabwe and commodities are now more expensive
So I and my family we are trying to make sure that we go for the cheaper option for my tertiary education which is coming to India but the only problem is money so will keep you updated on when we get the money and it's an ASAP matter
29/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
29/1/24, 4:23 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
29/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 506 3324: The calculations are very Correct and local education is quite expensive
29/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah Edoofa is very much affordable
29/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 78 506 3324: We will sort everything out
29/1/24, 7:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 8:02 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Okay sure thank you
30/1/24, 8:37 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 506 3324: Yes we can
30/1/24, 8:38 AM - +263 78 506 3324: How are you doing

I understand that we all have challenges in life and as your Career Counselor I am empathetic to helping you achieve the best of opportunities there are out there for you to be offered
30/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah I know them
30/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 506 3324: We will strive for the best sir
30/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 78 506 3324: Hmmm what is the reason sir
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 1.*Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 3.*Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
30/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 12:36 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah I'm ready sir
30/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yeah the information is accurate
30/1/24, 2:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 506 3324: The registration fee is usually between 500 to 750 usd depending on the university, so if u can't pay all at once u can pay in portions
30/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 78 506 3324: I have clearly understood you sir
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yes sir
30/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
30/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 506 3324: Yes sure
30/1/24, 4:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: At what time are parents available for a call?
