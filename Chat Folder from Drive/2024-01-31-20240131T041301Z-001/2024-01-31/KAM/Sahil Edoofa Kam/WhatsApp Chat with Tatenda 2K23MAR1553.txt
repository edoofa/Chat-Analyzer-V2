Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy.

I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 78 489 1629: Regarding Galgotias university, my parents were not in the best of financial situations at the moment, so they could not pay the registration fee.. In recent developments I was really hoping I could get another admission letter from your esteemed universities...

We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?

30/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 489 1629: I have and I've met little big obstacles in my research.. I've encountered how some of the Indian universities, where students are going, are providing outdated syllabuses of which are not internationally recognized, so I'm having difficulties in making a decision as if now. I was hoping you could help me with that
30/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means at loacl university in Zimbabwe  $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ? <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 78 489 1629: I think Indian education is very affordable 💯, but the main issue is, I believe I pointed it out in my previous message, if you could help me with that please..
30/1/24, 1:42 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 78 489 1629: Yes please
