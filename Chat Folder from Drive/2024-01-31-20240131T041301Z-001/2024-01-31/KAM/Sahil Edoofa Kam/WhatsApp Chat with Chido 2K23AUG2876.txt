I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*.  I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
16/1/24, 10:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 78 972 3321: Good day ..sorry for late response….we are great and we are in the process of taking results from the school
16/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. I understand. With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'
16/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
16/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
16/1/24, 7:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you were able to go through my message above. Indeed it was a great experience for all our Edoofians.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic journey.
17/1/24, 9:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education.

17/1/24, 9:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow me time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once I have evaluated your results, along with all the other applications for your university admission, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.

*I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority.

22/1/24, 2:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling your counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention as I recently connected with school head of Daramombe High School, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now? <This message was edited>
