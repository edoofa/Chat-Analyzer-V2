I am *Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician*@919821838532 to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

*I am Mr Sahil, *Senior Academician* at Edoofa*

 I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student . I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now? <This message was edited>
24/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 886 1991: There were financial altercations that happened which resulted in us being unable to clear up and finish off the registration process
24/1/24, 12:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you tell me what financial plans you had made since then?
24/1/24, 8:34 PM - +263 77 886 1991: I thought that since admission deadlines had been missed then probably this intake wasn't going to be possible so it then became about working on getting necessary funds before the next intake
