We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe. <This message was edited>

*Let me share all students who are in India have gone through what you might be experiencing now. There was a stage of uncertainty and confusion where we guided them as Career Counsellors to ensure our learners fulfill their aspirations!*
24/1/24, 1:50 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know any one of them as your senior's?
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +263 78 309 6004: ok I understand sir I know one of them
24/1/24, 6:23 PM - +263 78 309 6004: Keith Chaukura
24/1/24, 8:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

25/1/24, 9:30 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.” --- Andy McIntyre*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 78 309 6004: morning how are you sir
25/1/24, 11:36 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is wonderful to hear so have you discussed with Kieth about experiences of recent SLICE Con'24 Industrial visit hosted by Edoofa ?
25/1/24, 11:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academican and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
25/1/24, 11:41 AM - +263 78 309 6004: no sir explain further
25/1/24, 11:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
25/1/24, 11:45 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 1.*Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
25/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 11:46 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 3. *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

29/1/24, 11:04 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
29/1/24, 11:05 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
29/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 309 6004: in India I want to do medicine
29/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 309 6004: that's if it is possible
29/1/24, 3:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you study biology ?
29/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 78 309 6004: no I did maths physics and chemistry
they say I can use that combination
29/1/24, 3:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please Biology is a mandatory to study medicine
29/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 309 6004: so I guess we are sticking with electrical engineering then
29/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 309 6004: is there a chance to win a fully funded scholarship
29/1/24, 7:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 78 309 6004: ok sir
30/1/24, 8:42 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 78 309 6004: morning how are you
30/1/24, 10:35 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am fine thank you
30/1/24, 10:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you kindly elaborate ? I hope you are aware fully funded scholarship is just a Myth you don't even get such opportunity in Zimbabwe right ?
30/1/24, 11:33 AM - +263 78 309 6004: so what percentage will I have
30/1/24, 11:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally will recommend your name for high quantum.
30/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 78 309 6004: okay I will be waiting
30/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
30/1/24, 12:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 309 6004: no that part is clear sir
30/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 309 6004: yh I think the only thing left is to be connected with the universities
30/1/24, 1:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
30/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 309 6004: ok you can share sir I would appreciate that
30/1/24, 2:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What time are your parents available ?
30/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 77 344 6935: Available now
30/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 77 344 6935: Maybe, Thursday
30/1/24, 3:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know the reason for the delay ?Given the recent release of A-level results and the fast reservation of scholarship seats, it's crucial to take swift action to avoid missing out on opportunities
30/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 344 6935: We were intensely meditating upon the issue
30/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 344 6935: Sometimes we face network challenges
30/1/24, 3:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you visit a internet cafe tomorrow ?
30/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 344 6935: I will be attending workshop and it has no time frame
30/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 843 1073: I can do that, on her behalf
30/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: At what time please?
30/1/24, 4:00 PM - +263 78 843 1073: I would want to hear from you sir, since you are the one who made the request.
30/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 843 1073: Or we can say from 2 to 3 O’clock if thats okay with you
30/1/24, 4:02 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay can you call me at that time ?
30/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 843 1073: Okay. Is it a voice call or video call
30/1/24, 4:05 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Mostly video call
30/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 78 843 1073: Okay, sir

30/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 78 843 1073: I will to confirm with you early in the morning
30/1/24, 4:19 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay
30/1/24, 7:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
