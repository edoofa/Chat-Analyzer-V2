15/1/24, 10:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
15/1/24, 10:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.

22/1/24, 1:01 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?

[17/01, 11:14] +91 98218 38532: Failed in A level ?
[17/01, 11:14] +91 98218 38532: Can you please share the results ?
[17/01, 11:16] Pee: Yes
[17/01, 11:37] +91 98218 38532: Can you please share?
[17/01, 11:40] Pee: I have already shared to one of you.

[17/01, 12:38] +91 98218 38532: But that would waste one year right ?
[17/01, 12:40] +91 98218 38532: Can you share your O level results ?
[17/01, 12:40] Pee: Yaa that's wat she wants
[17/01, 12:43] +91 98218 38532: Rather than spending a year without progress, a more beneficial option would be for her to Start a diploma now. Following the completion of the diploma, she can seamlessly transition into a bachelor's program in the same field. This approach not only enhances her prospects of employment but also provides a solid foundation for the course through the preceding diploma.
[17/01, 12:54] Pee: Thank you for the advice we have discussed this with the family and the final decision is she is going back to do A level.IS THERE ANYWAY  WE CAN GET A REFUND?Thank you so much for all the efforts🙏
