19/12/23, 6:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Samantha.

I hope this message finds you well. I have been anticipating your response for the past week and we have not been able to have a conversation. I could not help but notice that you were able to go through the message I shared above. So I would like to understand if you are having some challenges that are holding you back from communicating with us because your inactivity is giving a negative impression on your scholarship application because you have already received an offer letter the university officials are also getting a negative impression that you are not serious about the scholarship offered.
26/12/23, 1:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. I am sorry to hear about that, may I know how are you doing now?
16/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Samantha,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:18 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
18/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 297 0375: Please find attached  samantha's results

22/1/24, 12:25 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 9:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.
24/1/24, 9:44 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 9:54 AM - +263 78 301 4570: Good morning sir.
Thank you for the motivational quotes.
24/1/24, 11:24 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please answer this?
24/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 301 4570: I have emmense zeal and passion in studying abroad in India but our finances are holding us back.
24/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
24/1/24, 12:37 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

24/1/24, 12:41 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
24/1/24, 12:46 PM - +263 78 301 4570: I have compared them thoroughly and India seems to be great
24/1/24, 1:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 301 4570: This is so amazing indeed.But what can l do since our finances are not stable.
24/1/24, 2:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Certainly. When you mention the inability to afford any fees, are you implying that the student is considering stopping studies to seek employment, or is it more about the overall fees being beyond your means, but you've managed to allocate a specific monthly budget for tertiary education?

29/1/24, 10:20 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 
I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects. Trust me to handle everything, and let's start fresh for a successful outcome. As a dedicated effort, I'm providing you with the option to call me directly if there are any delays in the process.
29/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 78 301 4570: Thank you so much sir, l really appreciate that and it means a lot to me and my family.
29/1/24, 2:06 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills

Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.
