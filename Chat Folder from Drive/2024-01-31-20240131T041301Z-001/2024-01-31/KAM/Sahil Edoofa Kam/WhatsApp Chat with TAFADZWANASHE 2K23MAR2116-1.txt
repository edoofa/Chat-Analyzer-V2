I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
16/1/24, 3:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

16/1/24, 7:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tafadzwanashe,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

27/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings mentors. This is TAFADZWANASHE JAKA. My ewylgroup is TAFADZWANASHE EWYL23E0093. I had been logged out of this group when l had whatsapp problems.
I have talked to my EWYL mentor about my a level results which were not really good. Please assist me if there is any hope l would be accepted in any university in India or if my results are not good, can they offer diplomas and apprenticeships so that one get the education needed to go to university.
29/1/24, 8:57 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263718001668 , 
*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

29/1/24, 8:58 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
29/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Greetings. When we last spoke it was before l wrote my A level in July 2023 and l was doing EWYL. I then got logged out of WhatsApp, even losing my EWYL group but l contacted my mentor directly and she added me to the the group numerous times until my whatsapp was stable.
Upon receiving my results, l managed to have to A level subjects and the third subject zimsec did not provide my result due to cala complications, although l wrote all the papers. I was disappointed and seeing that most of my peers who got an opportunity to study in India had flying colors.
This is the reason why l delayed contacting you when lost the ADMISSION group.

During my counselling you mentioned that the scholarship also looks at the performance of the student and my performance was not good.
Also l didn't think l would get enrolled in any prestigious university in India looking at my results.

My plans now were to hear from you how many passes one needs to get into university. If it is impossible and  l will accept whatever case it may be. This is why l had told my parent to wait since we didn't know if it was still possible.
29/1/24, 10:41 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Please can you add your parents to group so that I can make arrangements for you immediately , also please share your A level results.
29/1/24, 10:42 AM - +263 71 800 1668: Alright
29/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 71 800 1668: I'm only in contact with my mother.My parents separated and we hardly communicate with my father wherever he is. I will add her.

29/1/24, 12:51 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know why did you miss Accounting exam ?
29/1/24, 1:14 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I wrote the exams and l also sent a complain to zimsec. We have continuous assessment tests that we write before the final exams, so it happened that the Zimsec teachers did not attach my marks  so that l can receive the results. We were allowed to use the previous year's continuous assessment marks that's why even in mathematics l got my results using the previous cala.
29/1/24, 2:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What was the final outcome ?
29/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I'm yet to receive a reply from zimsec.
The cala marks we were not told.
29/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Did you get in touch with your school head ?
29/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 71 800 1668: Yes. When l collected the results l told him then he took a photocopy and told me he was going to sent a complain to zimsec.
29/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Okay so by when are you expecting to to hear from them?
29/1/24, 7:46 PM - +263 71 800 1668: I will try to ask tomorrow and l will let you know their response.
