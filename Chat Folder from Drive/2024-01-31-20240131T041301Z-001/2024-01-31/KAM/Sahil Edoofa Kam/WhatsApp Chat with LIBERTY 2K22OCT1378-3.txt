This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.

8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Liberty,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 77 687 7256: Thank you so much
9/1/24, 8:15 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: You are welcome, dear.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?

16/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Liberty,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
29/1/24, 8:41 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Day @263776877256 @263780770016 @263776163996 ,

30/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 077 0016: It's  because here   teachers are not teaching In classes . They mainly concentrate on extra lessons so sometimes de were not financially stable to attend extra lessons
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 077 0016: But i believe that if i rewrite In June those 2 subjects which i have poor grades i'm going to pass
30/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you aware of the cut off in Zimbabwe University ?
30/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 077 0016: Mmmm i guess it's 3 points
30/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Even two years ago, the requirement was 10 points, but this year it has increased to 12 points. Did you and your family not anticipate this change in planning, considering this it even affects eligibility for studying at recognized universities in Zimbabwe?
30/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 616 3996: In Zimbabwe  at Chinhoyi University of Technology it's at least 2 points to pursue one's studies and for the UZ I will ask my fellow students who learns there
30/1/24, 4:09 PM - +263 77 616 3996: It depends with the program you are studying
30/1/24, 4:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: For which course ?

30/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

30/1/24, 4:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
30/1/24, 4:17 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 616 3996: For me I am pursuing my degree on media studies and this is my third year ,as for liberty I guess he is rewriting his failed subjects this coming june
30/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Are you the parent?
30/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 77 616 3996: I am his sister
30/1/24, 6:04 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Elder sister right?
30/1/24, 6:27 PM - +263 77 616 3996: Yes
30/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
