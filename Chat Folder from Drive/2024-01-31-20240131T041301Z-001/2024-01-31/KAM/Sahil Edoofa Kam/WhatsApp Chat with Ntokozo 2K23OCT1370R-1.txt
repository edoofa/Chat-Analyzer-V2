I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

22/1/24, 1:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
23/1/24, 7:07 AM - +263 77 295 3488: Good morning
I thought we are waiting for response from universities now as per discussion, may you sssistwhere did we miss it
23/1/24, 7:23 AM - +263 77 295 3488: Since we sent all the needed details, as per discussion, we waiting for offer letter from Universities,kindly correct where am wrong
23/1/24, 11:54 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning 
I've noticed a slower pace in the admission process, and it seems there might be delays due to exams. However,I'm here to expedite the process for you, given my limited time. Your commitment to remaining active is crucial, as I'll be dedicating my personal time to assist you.
Confirm As per records : Have you selected Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor in Legislative law, planning to arrive in India by August 2024?
23/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 295 3488: Affirmative
23/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 295 3488: Around USD 750
23/1/24, 3:30 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is waived off from the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
23/1/24, 3:31 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program *as we recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.* Congratulations on securing the same. Now, let us assume,
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

4. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($1650-$1000= $650) and this remaining fee of $650 is supposed to be paid within 3 days of arrival.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
23/1/24, 9:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: let's schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT. If you face challenges or need a different time, let me know in this group. Success often comes from open communication about concerns.

29/1/24, 12:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?

29/1/24, 12:59 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

29/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 932 9662: Yes I am excited
29/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000. 

We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
29/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 932 9662: No I'm not sir
29/1/24, 2:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/1/24, 2:56 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 78 932 9662: Noted
29/1/24, 3:58 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 932 9662: I have no queries
29/1/24, 4:35 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
29/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 78 932 9662: Yes
29/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What time are parents available?
29/1/24, 7:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 932 9662: Ok sir
30/1/24, 8:34 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 932 9662: Yes we can start
30/1/24, 11:52 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Given the recent release of A-level results and the fast reservation of scholarship seats, it's crucial to take swift action to avoid missing out on opportunities.
30/1/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 295 3488: Good day
30/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 77 295 3488: We realized when she does law from that side, when she comes back she has to go back to our Uni for like a year for some modules,  to be able to practice in Zimbabwe.
30/1/24, 1:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: No please maybe someone has misguided you .
30/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Studying law in India offers a unique and enriching experience. The legal education system in India is well-regarded globally, and Indian law degrees are recognized in all countries, including Ireland and the UK. Additionally, India's legal framework is diverse, providing exposure to a wide range of legal traditions and systems.

By choosing to study law in India, you'll not only gain a solid foundation in the subject but also explore the complexities of a legal system deeply rooted in a rich cultural and historical context. This could offer you a well-rounded perspective that complements your understanding of law in countries like Ireland and the UK.

Moreover, studying in India often provides a cost-effective option without compromising on the quality of education. It's a fantastic opportunity to broaden your horizons while obtaining a credible legal education.

To give a example you will find a lot of students working with UN government offices or Embassies or even International Court of Justice have done their degrees from India
30/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Infact there is Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Bar Council of India (BCI) and its counterparts in England and Wales has confirmed that the English and Welsh legal services market is open to Indian lawyers and law firms.
