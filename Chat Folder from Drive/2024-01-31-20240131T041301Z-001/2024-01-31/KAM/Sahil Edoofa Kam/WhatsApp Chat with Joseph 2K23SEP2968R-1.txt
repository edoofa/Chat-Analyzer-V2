I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.

*I am Mr Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

If you remember well, I hosted the counselling and evaluation sessions for you through the Edoofa Scholarship Program from which you have made me proud by qualifying for the program.

24/1/24, 9:38 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Recalling our counseling and evaluation sessions, I take pride in your qualification for our esteemed Edoofa Scholarship Program. Recently, the A-level results from all my students have brought immense joy. Your name, in particular, caught my attention, and I was going through your Admissions Group and was shocked to see that you weren't able to complete the University registration process being a bright student and I still remember your passion for career and goals, making you one of my favourite students.  I personally had a discussion with the Admissions Head and have decided to help you in the best possible way as I understand your calibre.  May I know, what exactly happened due to which you weren't able to proceed and what are your plans as of now?
24/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 465 8373: My results for A level didn’t turn out well actually l had 2 points in one subject of which meaning l can’t qualify for BSc in Physiotherapy l guess
24/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: May I know what effected your results ?
24/1/24, 11:39 AM - +263 71 465 8373: Actually l don’t know was quit surprised with my results
24/1/24, 2:04 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share picture of your results ?
24/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 465 8373: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: But what according to you can be possible reasons ?
24/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 465 8373: I believe that l didn’t put enough effort and was over confident
24/1/24, 4:10 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: So what have you planned now ?
24/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 71 465 8373: Not sure yet

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
25/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 465 8373: Good morning
25/1/24, 10:33 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you share your O level results ?
25/1/24, 10:35 AM - +263 71 465 8373: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 12:45 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Considering your results, eligibility for a bachelor's program in Zimbabwe is not currently feasible. You have two available options: the first is to reappear for A-levels, and the second, which is often more suitable, is to begin with a diploma. Many students opt to commence with a diploma as it serves as a foundation for future bachelor's studies.

30/1/24, 8:40 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Good morning Everyone!*  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 6:55 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I was anticipating your response today but unfortunately, you were not available all day. I look forward to your active participation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT time. I am eager for our interaction. As we embark on a new day, let's reflect on the wisdom from Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV): *'Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.'*
