This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 8:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 8:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 8:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end following my previous messages. However, in recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 7:51 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
17/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 77 286 6195: ok thank you

*I am Ms.Harmehak,Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr.Sahil, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

25/1/24, 1:43 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I personally noticed challenges in your admission process, so I'm here to help. Despite not being part of the admission team, as a member of the academic bench, I'll personally ensure your application is completed within three days, securing the maximum scholarship percentage possible .This will make your education more affordable than studying locally and open up maximum employment prospects.

25/1/24, 6:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 77 286 6195: Good Morning Mr Sahil, it is my pleasure to be  connecting with you again this Morning... Wishing You a Happy Republic Day!

For the previous months, l haven't been able to connect with you because we had been undergoing time of crisis as a family. My Father had been admitted at a General Hospital for the previous two months. He had  *kidney failure* so he was admitted before the hospital concluded that he should undergo a dialysis process twice every week. The problem made us weak financially and as for now, we are privileged to have his hospital bills catered for by a Social Welfare Organization.

29/1/24, 10:48 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Good Morning
I'm sorry to hear about the health crisis your family has been facing, especially with your father's kidney failure. It's relieving to know that a Social Welfare Organization is now covering his hospital bills. I hope his health is improving.

In the midst of these challenges, I would like to know how you and your family are currently doing. Additionally, what are your academic plans now ?
29/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 77 286 6195: Thank you!
We are working on issues pertaining my University progress... The dream of being an international student is still my ONLY option and Edoofa is the only way..
29/1/24, 12:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you please share your A level results ?

 With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education. So shall we begin ?
30/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 286 6195: Good Morning Mr Sahil...

30/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 286 6195: Sure Please!!
30/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Noted
30/1/24, 11:06 AM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: How are you doing today?
30/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 77 286 6195: l am really fine and grateful
30/1/24, 12:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
30/1/24, 12:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications each day from students seeking Scholarship? We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

30/1/24, 12:47 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE) -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - ($680 per term)

Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - ($535 per term)

University of Zimbabwe (UZ) -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm ($523 per term)

NUST -($870 per term)

I'm sure you and your family have discussed this thoroughly. What decisions have you made for your future? Considering the cost and employment opportunities, have you compared the benefits of studying in India with the Edoofa program against other options?
30/1/24, 12:48 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Thats means $600*2 semester $1200 per year for tution fees $200 per year for internship 

$70 a month rent * 12 months = $840 a year for accommodation

Basic 3 meal sadza a day $1 per meal *3 meals a day *365 days = $1095 

Data bundles - $ 50 a month right * 12 months = $600 

Misc- $300 

Total at UZ = Exceeds $4100

Have you calculated this ?
Where as at Edoofa at top universities abroad you are only paying $2000-$3000 also complementary you are getting EWYL program to self finance the fees so which one is affordable ?
30/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 286 6195: It is to my amazement to note some of these facts. l had never been looking over some necessary analysis... I am currently noticing that Edoofa is far much better besides Educational Cost but the weight of being an international student <This message was edited>
30/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 77 286 6195: The EWYL program makes it even more affordable
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academic and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 286 6195: I think it's because of lack of patience, an ability to try and financial strength
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:08 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Yes, l am ready
30/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Sure!!!
30/1/24, 3:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor in Commerce and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Yes, it's accurate
30/1/24, 3:16 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Alright please!! 
Once l have registered, l have to reserve my seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500-$750.

I will then be given an acceptance letter for Visa processes to be easy
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 3:34 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000 

This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 286 6195: No, l understand
30/1/24, 3:57 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 77 286 6195: sure
30/1/24, 4:00 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. Shall I share the schedule with you?
30/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Sure please!!!
30/1/24, 6:12 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: What time are your parents available for call tomorrow ?
30/1/24, 6:13 PM - +263 77 286 6195: At 10.30am CAT
30/1/24, 6:14 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Can you call me at that time please?
30/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 77 286 6195: Alright please.. We will use the same number or you have a Zimbabwean line?
30/1/24, 6:29 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: Same number
30/1/24, 7:13 PM - Sahil Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
