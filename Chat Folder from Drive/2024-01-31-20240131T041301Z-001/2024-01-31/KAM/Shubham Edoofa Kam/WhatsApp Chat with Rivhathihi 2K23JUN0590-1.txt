12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rivhathihi,

I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.

17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Ohkay

23/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Good morning sir
Forgive me for the late reply
Had problems with the network
23/1/24, 11:01 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I totally understand please!
23/1/24, 11:02 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Rivhathihi, Can  you help me understand on why have yoou been inactive for the past few months?
23/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 77 923 2295: For the past few months l have been inactive because l was at school and it was not permitted to have phones at school
23/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 923 2295: When l closed for schools l was now actived at the EWYL line
23/1/24, 12:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly Noted Please!
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So I believe that the time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career. Don't you think so?
23/1/24, 12:49 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes
Thats true
23/1/24, 1:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted, So let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Commerce and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes it is correct sir
23/1/24, 3:11 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we proceed with your university admission, our main focus is on completing your scholarship application and sharing it with universities tailored to your chosen course, endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will handle the submission of your application to various universities. Once they evaluate your eligibility, if found suitable, you'll receive a comprehensive offer letter detailing the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information ensures a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
In the event that multiple universities accept your application, it's important to note that practically studying at multiple universities is not feasible right ?
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Well noted sir
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes it is not feasible
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you
23/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Well noted sir
23/1/24, 7:25 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
23/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you sir
Have a great day sir
24/1/24, 9:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” —Malcolm X"*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
24/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Good morning sire
24/1/24, 10:19 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you for the encouragement
24/1/24, 11:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
24/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Not yet sir
24/1/24, 3:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
24/1/24, 3:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
24/1/24, 3:36 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
24/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Dats correct
24/1/24, 5:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
24/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you sir for sharing your time with me
25/1/24, 9:27 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

Sorry for the late reply
25/1/24, 11:49 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a senior academican and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar.

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?

29/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Im very sorry for not attending the session today l had a fallout with the network connections
29/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Well noted Mr Shubham
29/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 77 252 6859: Good evening
30/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Good day Mr Shubham Madhwal
30/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 77 923 2295: I am a proud Edoofian
30/1/24, 8:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
30/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Thank you for the inspiration
30/1/24, 8:58 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes we may continue, sir
30/1/24, 9:29 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Shall we continue from here please?
30/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes we shall continue sir
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 9:38 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
30/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes l am ready to step into higher education through the Edoofa program
30/1/24, 10:31 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Commerce and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
30/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes the information is accurate
30/1/24, 11:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
30/1/24, 11:25 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
30/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes l do recall
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
30/1/24, 1:49 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee that you pay will be subtracted from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
30/1/24, 5:26 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Not yet sir
30/1/24, 5:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
30/1/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Yes l am clear with the details
30/1/24, 5:50 PM - +263 77 923 2295: So after paying for the refistration fee we wait for the Offer letter
30/1/24, 5:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please you are correct
30/1/24, 5:52 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that please, So to get your University letter prepared, 

I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certific*
30/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 923 2295: Ohkay

Well noted sir
