8/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career.

8/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Marvelous,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 3:02 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.

29/1/24, 1:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
29/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 71 806 8210: May I know if I can do medicine there in India
29/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: No please,  that will not be possible as if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
29/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 806 8210: It's ok noted
29/1/24, 1:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.

29/1/24, 1:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?
29/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 806 8210: Ohhh I didn't know it , thank you for letting me know
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
29/1/24, 1:51 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
29/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 806 8210: They are still undecided
29/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @263718068210 Let me help you understand the Situation in Zimbabwe in much more detail

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal which is Sadza and curry costs a student $1 one time and you are aware of this better. The cost of *Accommodation, Food, Wifi, stationery, gadgets, transport* etc is an additional expense for a student. The initial registration fee for the Zimbabwean Universities ranges from *$20-$75 without the guarantee of being eligible or not.* The *attachment fee before graduation ranges from $200 or more.*
29/1/24, 2:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me tell you, I was caught in surprise when I compared it with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, not because of affordability but the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and be employable. Speaking about Employability, do you feel Zimbabwe is ready to equip the graduates with job opportunities in their aspired fields?
29/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 806 8210: Zimbabwe is no ready for that
29/1/24, 3:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
29/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 71 806 8210: I don't know why
29/1/24, 3:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 4:34 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @263718068210 I have noted all your responses for the day, Since my working hours for the day are over now, *I have therefore scheduled your session for 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow*

God Bless you,
Have a great day ahead!
30/1/24, 8:35 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good morning!  let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*"As the scriptures teach, knowledge is a steadfast companion. A person enlightened by wisdom is held in high regard across all realms. The brilliance of education surpasses the allure of beauty and the vigor of youth."*

May our journey of learning be guided by the profound teachings that echo through the ages. With positive energy, let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education.
