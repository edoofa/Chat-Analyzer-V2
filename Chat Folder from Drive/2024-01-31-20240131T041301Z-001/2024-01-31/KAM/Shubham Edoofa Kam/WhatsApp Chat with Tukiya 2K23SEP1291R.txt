16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tukiya

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

30/1/24, 1:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Being a senior academician and counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.

*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
30/1/24, 1:53 PM - +260 768974217: No, I don't know
30/1/24, 2:17 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>

30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
30/1/24, 2:38 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *1. Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful.
30/1/24, 2:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
30/1/24, 2:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *3. Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments.

30/1/24, 5:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee.
