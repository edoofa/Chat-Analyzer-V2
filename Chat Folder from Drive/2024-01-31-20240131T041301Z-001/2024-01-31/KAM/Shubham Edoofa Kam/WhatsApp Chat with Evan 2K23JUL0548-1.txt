I trust this message finds you in good health. As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
12/1/24, 6:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
12/1/24, 6:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Proud Edoofians,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?

29/1/24, 11:32 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechatronics Engineering) and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?

29/1/24, 11:47 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*

Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
29/1/24, 11:49 AM - +263 78 104 4501: Yes I do recall but I have lost most of the data in our conversations as the simcard I was using was blocked from whatapp
29/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 104 4501: That's the reason I had to ask to join the group using my other simcard
29/1/24, 12:00 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: i totally understand,
29/1/24, 12:00 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Let me help you with a better understanding. *Usually, the registration fee is an additional fee apart from the cost of education but Edoofians receive an exclusive benefit where it is a part of the cost of education itself.* Let me give you an example:-
29/1/24, 12:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counseling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2700-$3700 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
2. Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
3. Registration Fee to be paid: $1000
29/1/24, 12:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education($3600-$1000= $2600) and this remaining fee of $2600 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $1300 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $1300 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.
29/1/24, 12:01 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?
29/1/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 104 4501: Non
29/1/24, 12:13 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
29/1/24, 12:17 PM - +263 78 104 4501: Yes
29/1/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 104 4501: But can you send the details
29/1/24, 12:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Surely Evan
