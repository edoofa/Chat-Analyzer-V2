16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Osile,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey. <This message was edited>
16/1/24, 11:26 AM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - +27 61 282 2560: Helo everyone
16/1/24, 4:05 PM - +27 61 282 2560: Hope you are doing well

Thank you for asking, I am doing great. It is alright please, we will discuss that as well. However, may I know if you were able to go through the message above I shared yesterday?
17/1/24, 1:04 PM - +27 61 282 2560: <Media omitted>
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I am sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will quickly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
17/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 1:06 PM - +27 61 282 2560: I can understand  but the issue is i dont think i will manage the payments bwcause of the sitiation i have now .
17/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you must have been facing financial challenges as you expressed to me above. However, you know despite the challenges students are able to pursue their higher education abroad. And I personally had a discussion with Mr.Shubham your career counselor and he mentioned that he informed me that he remembered everything about Osile when you initially enrolled and that is why he personally showed interest in your application and wants to connect with you on Monday. See our goal is not only to provide you with a quality education but even understand the challenges you go through and then provide you with a solution to those challenges in particular. Being your admission officer I would suggest you connect with Mr. Shubham on Monday and share your concerns with him so that he can assist you.

24/1/24, 1:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
24/1/24, 1:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So after looking at the facts shared above what do you think is more advantageous, to study at a globally recognized university abroad with an abundance of exposure and opportunities along with a similar fee structure as compared to studying at a local university where you will have no guarantee if you would get a job or not?
24/1/24, 1:33 PM - +27 61 282 2560: The isaue is we still have a lot to go still need visa still need a ticket iam now alond i once told you that iam a single mother  so the pressure is in me alone iam failing to cover all the needs
24/1/24, 2:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security?
