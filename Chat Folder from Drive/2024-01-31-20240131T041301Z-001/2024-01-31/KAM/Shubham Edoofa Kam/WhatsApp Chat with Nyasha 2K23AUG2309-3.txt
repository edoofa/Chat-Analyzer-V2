20/12/23, 1:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet

16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 513 1808: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 78 513 1808: How are you maam
16/1/24, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
16/1/24, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 6:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
16/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Thank You maam
16/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 78 513 1808: I will wait sternly for your decision
16/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Is it possible to send my O level results as you inquired about them maam

*I am Ms Tushti, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Hi maam

22/1/24, 5:05 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Im doing okay n you
22/1/24, 7:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

23/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir these are mine
23/1/24, 9:17 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So Nyasha, Since you were unable to score low, Now you are only left with 2 options, Firstly to pursue a diploma course, The benefit for this will be that you will begin your course within the month of July-August this year itself, Or to reappear for your a-level, Since you will have to clear all 3 subjects as you wanted to pursue B.Tech Aerospace.
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 513 1808: I don’t understand sir
23/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 513 1808: Which diploma will i pursue <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 10:54 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please, Since Aerospace engineering is a very niche and technically advanced course hence, diplomas for this course are not covered under the scholarship, That's why I would suggest you opt for a *Diploma in Mechanical Engineering*  the reason being Aerospace engineering comes under its umbrella and the course curriculum will be in line with the same. After completion of this diploma, you can even pursue your Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering if you would like to do so.
23/1/24, 10:55 AM - +263 78 513 1808: Ooh okay sir 
So if i may ask

23/1/24, 11:30 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please the course will be 3 years long, Shall I brief yoou about the same in detail?
23/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
23/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 78 513 1808: Does civil engineering require a level?
23/1/24, 1:09 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please can  you elaborate on your question?
23/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Basing on my results can i study civil engineering
23/1/24, 1:42 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Please you mean a Diploma in Civil Engineering correct?
23/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
23/1/24, 2:48 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, you can be offered a Diploma in Civil Engineering, *But do note that if later on you decide to pursue Aerospace Engineering* then it won't be possible
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Im aware sir
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted, So you wish to pursue, Diploma in Civil Engineering please?
23/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 513 1808: Let me talk to my parents first sir
23/1/24, 3:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So how long will that take?
23/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day.
